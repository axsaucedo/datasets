"We investigate various properties associated with the tilt of isolated magnetic bipoles in magnetograms taken at the solar surface. We show that bipoles can be divided into two groups which have tilts of opposite signs, and reveal similar properties with respect to bipole area, flux and bipolar moment. Detailed comparison of these physical quantities shows that the dividing point between the two types of bipoles corresponds to a bipole area of about 300 millionths of the solar hemisphere (MHS). The time-latitude distribution of small bipoles differs substantially from that for large bipoles. Such behaviour in terms of dynamo theory may indicate that small and large bipoles trace different components of the solar magnetic field. The other possible viewpoint is that the difference in tilt data for small and large bipoles is connected with spectral helicity separation, which results in opposite tilts for small and large bipoles. We note that the data available do not provide convincing reasons to prefer either interpretation.",0
"We generalise the hyper-Kahler/quaternionic Kahler (HK/QK) correspondence to include para-geometries, and present a new concise proof that the target manifold of the HK/QK correspondence is quaternionic Kahler. As an application, we construct one-parameter deformations of the temporal and Euclidean supergravity c-map metrics and show that they are para-quaternionic Kahler.",0
"We carry out the stability analysis of the Schwarzschild black hole in Gauss-Bonnet and Chern-Simons-scalar theory. Here, we introduce two quadratic scalar couplings ($\phi_1^2,\phi_2^2$) to Gauss-Bonnet and Chern-Simons terms, where the former term is parity-even, while the latter one is parity-odd. The perturbation equation for the scalar $\phi_1$ is the Klein-Gordon equation with an effective mass, while the perturbation equation for $\phi_2$ is coupled to the parity-odd metric perturbation, providing a system of two coupled equations. It turns out that the Schwarzschild black hole is unstable against $\phi_1$ perturbation, leading to scalarized black holes, while the black hole is stable against $\phi_2$ and metric perturbations, implying no scalarized black holes.",0
"A pair of two level atoms A1A2, prepared either in a separable state or in an entangled state, interacts with a single mode of two mode squeezed cavity field while a third atomic qubit B interacts with the second mode of the squeezed field in a remote cavity. We analyze, numerically, the generation, sudden death and revival of three qubit entanglement as a function of initial entanglement of qubits A1A2 and degree of squeezing of electromagnetic field. Global negativity of partially transposed state operator is used to quantify the entanglement of three atom state. It is found that the initial entanglement of two mode field as well as that of the pair A1A2, both, contribute to three atom entanglement. A maximally entangled single excitation Bell pair in first cavity and two mode field with squeeze parameter s=0.64 are the initial conditions that optimize the peak value of three qubit mixed state entanglement. A smaller value of s=0.4 under similar conditions is found to generate a three qubit mixed state with comparable entanglement dynamics free from entanglement sudden death.",0
"This paper proposes an efficient implementation of the generalized labeled multi-Bernoulli (GLMB) filter by combining the prediction and update into a single step. In contrast to an earlier implementation that involves separate truncations in the prediction and update steps, the proposed implementation requires only one truncation procedure for each iteration. Furthermore, we propose an efficient algorithm for truncating the GLMB filtering density based on Gibbs sampling. The resulting implementation has a linear complexity in the number of measurements and quadratic in the number of hypothesized objects.",0
"We present the detection of a low surface-brightness stellar counterpart to an enormous (190 kpc) ring of neutral hydrogen (HI) gas that surrounds the nearby radio galaxy B2 0648+27. This system is currently in an evolutionary stage between major merger and (radio-loud) early-type galaxy. In a previous paper we investigated in detail the timescales between merger, starburst and AGN activity in B2 0648+27, based on its unusual multi-wavelength properties (large-scale HI ring, dominating post-starburst stellar population and infra-red luminosity). In this Research Note we present deep optical B- and V-band imaging that provides further evidence for the merger origin of B2 0648+27. The host galaxy shows a distorted optical morphology and a broad tidal arm is clearly present. A low surface-brightness stellar tail or partial ring curls around more than half the host galaxy at a distance of up to 55 kpc from the centre of the galaxy, following the large-scale, ring-like HI structure that we detected previously around this system. The gas and stars in this ring are most likely tidally expelled material that slowly fell back onto the host galaxy after the merger event. There also appear to be sites of star formation in the HI ring that may have formed within the gaseous tidal debris after the merger. We argue that the observed properties of the gas and stars in B2 0648+27, as well as the apparent time-delay between the merger and the starburst event, may be the logical result of a merger between two gas-rich disk galaxies with a prominent bulge, or of a merger between an elliptical and a gas-rich spiral galaxy. There also appears to be a significant time-delay between the merger/starburst event and the current episode of radio-AGN activity.",0
"A key concern in modern distributed systems is to avoid the cost of coordination while maintaining consistent semantics. Until recently, there was no answer to the question of when coordination is actually required. In this paper we present an informal introduction to the CALM Theorem, which answers this question precisely by moving up from traditional storage consistency to consider properties of programs. CALM is an acronym for """"consistency as logical monotonicity"""". The CALM Theorem shows that the programs that have consistent, coordination-free distributed implementations are exactly the programs that can be expressed in monotonic logic. This theoretical result has practical implications for developers of distributed applications. We show how CALM provides a constructive application-level counterpart to conventional """"systems"""" wisdom, such as the apparently negative results of the CAP Theorem. We also discuss ways that monotonic thinking can influence distributed systems design, and how new programming language designs and tools can help developers write consistent, coordination-free code.",0
"Over the regime of the radiation-induced zero-resistance states and associated oscillatory magnetoresistance, we propose a low magnetic field analog of quantum-Hall-limit techniques for the electrical detection of electron spin- and nuclear magnetic- resonance, dynamical nuclear polarization via electron spin resonance, and electrical characterization of the nuclear spin polarization via the Overhauser shift. In addition, beats observed in the radiation-induced oscillatory-magnetoresistance are developed into a method to measure and control the zero-field spin splitting due to the Bychkov-Rashba and bulk inversion asymmetry terms in the high mobility GaAs/AlGaAs system.",0
"We have developed a new generation of low noise, broadband feeds for the Allen Telescope Array at the Hat Creek Observatory in Northern California. The new feeds operate over the frequency range 0.9 to 14 GHz. The noise temperatures of the feeds have been substantially improved by cooling the entire feed structure as well as the low noise amplifiers to 70 K. To achieve this improved performance, the new feeds are mounted in glass vacuum bottles with plastic lenses that maximize the microwave transmission through the bottles. Both the cooled feeds and their low noise amplifiers produce total system temperatures that are in the range 25-30 K from 1 GHz to 5 GHz and 40-50 K up to 12.5 GHz.",0
"The existence of ideal quantum measurements is one of the fundamental predictions of quantum mechanics. In theory the measurement projects onto the eigenbasis of the measurement observable while preserving all coherences of degenerate eigenstates. The question arises whether there are dynamical processes in nature that correspond to such ideal quantum measurements. Here we address this question and present experimental results monitoring the dynamics of a naturally occurring measurement process: the coupling of a trapped ion qutrit to the photon environment. By taking tomographic snapshots during the detection process, we show with an average fidelity of $94\%$ that the process develops in agreement with the model of an ideal quantum measurement.",0
The QCD anomaly leads to an abnormal mixing and mass pattern for the pseudoscalar mesons. Furthermore it is responsible for the quality of isospin symmetry in the meson spectrum. Similarities between the large mixing angles among the neutral 0^-+ mesons and the large mixing angles observed in neutrino oscillations are pointed out.,0
"The infrared structure of spontaneously broken gauge theories is phenomenologically very important and theoretically a challenging problem. Various attempts have been made to calculate the higher order behavior of large double-logarithmic (DL) corrections originating from the exchange of electroweak gauge bosons resulting in contradictory claims. We present results from two loop electroweak corrections for the process $g \longrightarrow f_{\rm R} {\bar f}_{\rm L}$ to DL accuracy. This process is ideally suited as a theoretical model reaction to study the effect of the mass gap of the neutral electroweak gauge bosons at the two loop level. Contrary to recent claims in the literature, we find that the calculation performed with the physical Standard Model fields is in perfect agreement with the results from the infrared evolution equation method. In particular, we can confirm the exponentiation of the electroweak Sudakov logarithms through two loops.",0
"In this paper we study various scribability problems for polytopes. We begin with the classical $k$-scribability problem proposed by Steiner and generalized by Schulte, which asks about the existence of $d$-polytopes that cannot be realized with all $k$-faces tangent to a sphere. We answer this problem for stacked and cyclic polytopes for all values of $d$ and $k$. We then continue with the weak scribability problem proposed by Gr\""""unbaum and Shephard, for which we complete the work of Schulte by presenting non weakly circumscribable $3$-polytopes. Finally, we propose new $(i,j)$-scribability problems, in a strong and a weak version, which generalize the classical ones. They ask about the existence of $d$-polytopes that can not be realized with all their $i$-faces """"avoiding"""" the sphere and all their $j$-faces """"cutting"""" the sphere. We provide such examples for all the cases where $j-i \le d-3$.",0
"Exclusive production of $\omega$ mesons was studied at the COMPASS experiment by scattering $160~\mathrm{GeV}/\mathit{c}$ muons off transversely polarised protons. Five single-spin and three double-spin azimuthal asymmetries were measured in the range of photon virtuality $1~(\mathrm{GeV}/\mathit{c})^2 < Q^2 < 10~(\mathrm{GeV}/\mathit{c})^2$, Bjorken scaling variable $0.003 < x_{\mathit{Bj}} < 0.3$ and transverse momentum squared of the $\omega$ meson $0.05~(\mathrm{GeV}/\mathit{c})^2 < p_{T}^{2} < 0.5~(\mathrm{GeV}/\mathit{c})^2$. The measured asymmetries are sensitive to the nucleon helicity-flip Generalised Parton Distributions (GPD) $E$ that are related to the orbital angular momentum of quarks, the chiral-odd GPDs $H_{T}$ that are related to the transversity Parton Distribution Functions, and the sign of the $\pi\omega$ transition form factor. The results are compared to recent calculations of a GPD-based model.",0
"In this paper, we study the perturbative aspects of a """"B-twisted"""" two-dimensional $(0,2)$ heterotic sigma model on a holomorphic gauge bundle $\mathcal E$ over a complex, hermitian manifold $X$. We show that the model can be naturally described in terms of the mathematical theory of ``Chiral Differential Operators"""". In particular, the physical anomalies of the sigma model can be reinterpreted as an obstruction to a global definition of the associated sheaf of vertex superalgebras derived from the free conformal field theory describing the model locally on $X$. In addition, one can also obtain a novel understanding of the sigma model one-loop beta function solely in terms of holomorphic data. At the $(2,2)$ locus, one can describe the resulting half-twisted variant of the topological B-model in terms of a $\it{mirror}$ """"Chiral de Rham complex"""" (or CDR) defined by Malikov et al. in \cite{GMS1}. Via mirror symmetry, one can also derive various conjectural expressions relating the sheaf cohomology of the mirror CDR to that of the original CDR on pairs of Calabi-Yau mirror manifolds. An analysis of the half-twisted model on a non-K\""""ahler group manifold with torsion also allows one to draw conclusions about the corresponding sheaves of CDR (and its mirror) that are consistent with mathematically established results by Ben-Bassat in \cite{ben} on the mirror symmetry of generalised complex manifolds. These conclusions therefore suggest an interesting relevance of the sheaf of CDR in the recent study of generalised mirror symmetry.",0
"The operator algebraic framework plays an important role in mathematical physics. Many different operator algebras exist for example for a theory of quantum mechanics. In Loop Quantum Gravity only two algebras have been introduced until now. In the project about 'Algebras of Quantum Variables (AQV) for LQG' the known holonomy-flux *-algebra and the Weyl C*-algebra will be modified and a set of new algebras will be proposed and studied. The idea of the construction of these algebras is to establish a finite set of operators, which generates (in the sense of Woronowicz, Schm\""""udgen and Inoue) the different O*- or C*-algebras of quantum gravity and to use inductive limits of these algebras. In the Loop Quantum Gravity approach usually the basic classical variables are connections and fluxes. Studying the three constraints appearing in the canonical quantisation of classical general relativity in the ADM-formalism some other variables like curvature appear. Consequently the main difficulty of a quantisation of gravity is to find a suitable replacement of the set of elementary classical variables and constraints. The algebra of quantum gravity is supposed to be generated by a set of the operators associated to holonomies, fluxes and in some cases even the curvature. There are two reasonable choices for this algebra: The set of constraints of Quantum Gravity are contained in or at least the constraints are affilliated with this algebra. Secondly, the algebra of quantum variables is said to be physical if it contains complete observables. In the project of 'Algebras of Quantum Variables for LQG' different algebras will be studied with respect to the property of being a physical algebra. Furthermore the existence of KMS-states on these algebras will be argued.",0
"We study the suppression of high-pT hadron spectra in nuclear collisions, supplementing the perturbative QCD factorized formalism with radiative parton energy loss. We find that the nuclear modification factor which quantifies the degree of suppression, is almost pT-independent both for RHIC (in agreement with data) and for the LHC. This is a consequence of the shape of the partonic pT-spectrum in elementary collisions which implies that for the same value of the nuclear modification factor at higher pT, an increasingly smaller fraction of parton energy loss is needed. When the values of the time-averaged transport coefficient exceed 5 GeV^2/fm, the nuclear modification factor gradually loses its sensitivity to the corresponding produced energy density. This is due to particle production in the outer corona of the medium, which remains almost unsuppressed even for extreme densities. Thus, even for the highest experimentally accessible transverse momentum at the LHC and in contrast to jets, the measurement of leading partons via leading hadrons is not a penetrating probe of the dense matter, but a rather fragile probe which fragments for the opacities reached below the skin of the medium. Relating the transport coefficient to the energy density produced in the collision region, we find and discuss a phenomenon reminiscent of the opacity problem of elliptic flow: namely, the interaction of the hard parent parton with the medium appears to be much stronger than that expected for perturbative interactions of the hard parton with an ideal quark gluon plasma.",0
"Let x and y be two (not necessarily distinct) points on a closed Riemannian manifold M of dimension n. According to a celebrated theorem by J.P. Serre there exist infinitely many geodesics between x and y. The length of the shortest of these geodesics is obviously less than the diameter of M. But what can be said about the length of the other geodesics? We conjecture that for every k there are k geodesics between x and y of length not exceeding kd, where d denotes the diameter of M.This conjecture is obviously true for round spheres and it is not difficult to prove it for all closed Riemannian manifolds with non-trivial torsion-free fundamental groups. In this paper we announce two further results in the direction of this conjecture. Our first result is that the length of the second shortest geodesic between x and y does not exceed 2nd. Our second result is that if n=2 and M is diffeomorphic to the two-dimensional sphere, then for every k every two points on M can be connected by k geodesics of length not exceeding $(k^2/2 + 3k/2 +2)d$.",0
We define and study complex structures and generalizations on spaces consisting of geodesics or harmonic maps that are compatible with the symmetries of these spaces. The main results are about existence and uniqueness of such structures.,0
"This talk discusses our old work on the hadronic light-by-light contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment and some more recent contributions. I discuss the various contributions starting with pseudo-scalar meson exchange, the quark- and pion-loop, as well as scalar and $a_1$-exchange. For the $\pi^0$-exchange I point out a possible large enhancement when only connected contributions are included. For the quark-loop I include some comments about the more recent estimates of this contribution. The pion-loop is discussed in more detail, in particular I discuss our unpublished work on including effects from $a_1$ and the polarizability.",0
"We analyze charging-energy-protected Majorana-based qubits, focusing on the residual dephasing that is present when the distance between Majorana zero modes (MZMs) is insufficient for full topological protection. We argue that the leading source of dephasing is $1/f$ charge noise. This noise affects the qubit as a result of the hybridization energy and charge distribution associated with weakly-overlapping MZMs, which we calculate using a charge-conserving formalism. We estimate the coherence time to be hundreds of nanoseconds for Majorana-based qubits whose MZM separation is $L\sim 5\xi$ (with $\xi$ being the coherence length). The coherence time grows exponentially with MZM separation and eventually becomes temperature-limited for $L/\xi \sim 30$.",0
"We study local and global existence of solutions for some semilinear parabolic initial boundary value problems with autonomous nonlinearities having a """"Newtonian"""" nonlocal term.",0
"Two years ago, F.C. Marques and A.A. Neves implemented, in the framework of closed rectifiable 2-dimensional currents of the 3-dimensional sphere, a min-max method in geometric measure theory due to F. Almgren and J. Pitts. Using this approach they succeeded in proving that the famous Clifford torus minimizes the area among all closed minimal surfaces of non-zero genus in $S^3$. Another spectacular consequence of their work is to provide a proof of the Willmore conjecture. The goal of this talk is to discuss first the general framework of these two theorems of Marques and Neves. We shall then present the structures and some key details of their proofs. We will then address the scope of this remarkable contribution to the calculus of variations on surfaces in a 3-dimensional space.",0
"We study the anisotropy of II-order structure functions defined in a frame attached to the local mean field in three-dimensional (3D) direct numerical simulations of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, including or not the solar wind expansion. We simulate spacecraft flybys through the numerical domain by taking increments along the radial (wind) direction that forms an angle of $45^o$ with the ambient magnetic field. We find that only when expansion is taken into account, do the synthetic observations match the 3D anisotropy observed in the solar wind, including the change of anisotropy with scales. Our simulations also show that the anisotropy changes dramatically when considering increments oblique to the radial directions. Both results can be understood by noting that expansion reduces the radial component of the magnetic field at all scales, thus confining fluctuations in the plane perpendicular to the radial. Expansion is thus shown to affect not only the (global) spectral anisotropy, but also the local anisotropy of second-order structure functions by influencing the distribution of the local mean field, which enters this higher-order statistics.",0
"We prove the wellposedness of scalar wave equations on spatially flat universe as a background with nonminimal coupling with the scalar potential turned on by introducing the $k$-order linear energy and the corresponding energy norm. In the local case, we show that both the $k$-order linear energy and the energy norm are bounded for finite time with initial data in $H^{k+1}\times H^{k}$. Whereas in the global case, we have to add three assumptions related to the nonminimal coupling constant, the scale factor of spacetimes, and the form of the scalar that has to be a polynomial with a small positive parameter. Then, we show that the solution does globally exist with a particular decay estimate that depends on the scale factor of the spacetimes. Finally, we provide some physical models that support our general setup.",0
"Top-$N$ recommender systems have been extensively studied. However, the sparsity of user-item activities has not been well resolved. While many hybrid systems were proposed to address the cold-start problem, the profile information has not been sufficiently leveraged. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of profiles between users and items intensifies the challenge. In this paper, we propose a content-based top-$N$ recommender system by learning the global term weights in profiles. To achieve this, we bring in PathSim, which could well measures the node similarity with heterogeneous relations (between users and items). Starting from the original TF-IDF value, the global term weights gradually converge, and eventually reflect both profile and activity information. To facilitate training, the derivative is reformulated into matrix form, which could easily be paralleled. We conduct extensive experiments, which demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.",0
"We discuss a possibility of observing superfluid phenomena in a quasi-1D weakly interacting Bose gas at finite temperatures. The weakness of interaction in combination with generic properties of 1D liquids can result in a situation when relaxational time of supercurrent is essentially larger than the time of experimental observation, and the behavior of the system is indistinguishable from that of a genuine superfluid.",0
"We present an effective model for timing-dependent synaptic plasticity (STDP) in terms of two interacting traces, corresponding to the fraction of activated NMDA receptors and the Ca2+ concentration in the dendritic spine of the postsynaptic neuron. This model intends to bridge the worlds of existing simplistic phenomenological rules and highly detailed models, constituting thus a practical tool for the study of the interplay between neural activity and synaptic plasticity in extended spiking neural networks. For isolated pairs of pre- and postsynaptic spikes the standard pairwise STDP rule is reproduced, with appropriate parameters determining the respective weights and time scales for the causal and the anti-causal contributions. The model contains otherwise only three free parameters which can be adjusted to reproduce triplet nonlinearities in both hippocampal culture and cortical slices. We also investigate the transition from time-dependent to rate-dependent plasticity occurring for both correlated and uncorrelated spike patterns.",0
"We develop a rigorous method to parametrize complex structures for Klein-Gordon theory in globally hyperbolic spacetimes that satisfy a completeness condition. The complex structures are conserved under time-evolution and implement unitary quantizations. They can be interpreted as corresponding to global choices of vacuum. The main ingredient in our construction is a system of operator differential equations. We provide a number of theorems ensuring that all ingredients and steps in the construction are well-defined. We apply the method to exhibit natural quantizations for certain classes of globally hyperbolic spacetimes. In particular, we consider static, expanding and Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetimes.",0
"This is an extended abstract of a lecture held at the Conference ``Fourier and Radon transformations on symmetric spaces'' in honor of Professor S. Helgason's 65th birthday, Roskilde, Denmark, Sept. 10--12, 1992.",0
"We describe a method for analysing the temporal structure of a discourse which takes into account the effects of tense, aspect, temporal adverbials and rhetorical structure and which minimises unnecessary ambiguity in the temporal structure. It is part of a discourse grammar implemented in Carpenter's ALE formalism. The method for building up the temporal structure of the discourse combines constraints and preferences: we use constraints to reduce the number of possible structures, exploiting the HPSG type hierarchy and unification for this purpose; and we apply preferences to choose between the remaining options using a temporal centering mechanism. We end by recommending that an underspecified representation of the structure using these techniques be used to avoid generating the temporal/rhetorical structure until higher-level information can be used to disambiguate.",0
"OCTOCAM is a multi-channel imager and spectrograph that has been proposed for the 10.4m GTC telescope. It will use dichroics to split the incoming light to produce simultaneous observations in 8 different bands, ranging from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared. The imaging mode will have a field of view of 2' x 2' in u, g, r, i, z, J, H and Ks bands, whereas the long-slit spectroscopic mode will cover the complete range from 4,000 to 23,000 {\AA} with a resolution of 700 - 1,700 (depending on the arm and slit width). An additional mode, using an image slicer, will deliver a spectral resolution of over 3,000. As a further feature, it will use state of the art detectors to reach high readout speeds of the order of tens of milliseconds. In this way, OCTOCAM will be occupying a region of the time resolution - spectral resolution - spectral coverage diagram that is not covered by a single instrument in any other observatory, with an exceptional sensitivity.",0
A class of infinite horizon optimal control problems involving mixed quasi-norms of $L^p$-type cost functionals for the controls is discussed. These functionals enhance sparsity and switching properties of the optimal controls. The existence of optimal controls and their structural properties are analyzed on the basis of first order optimality conditions. A dynamic programming approach is used for numerical realization.,0
"In this note several computations of equivariant cohomology groups are performed. For the compactly supported equivariant cohomology, the notion of infinitesimal index developed in arXiv:1003.3525, allows to describe these groups in terms of certain spaces of distributions arising in the theory of splines. The new version contains a large number of improvements.",0
"Two years ago, the astronomical community witnessed a historical breakthrough observation: the detection of a short Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) by gamma-ray instruments in coincidence with the detection of a Gravitation Wave (GW) signal produced by the coalescence of two binary neutron stars. This joint GRB-GW observation paved the way to a new chapter in modern astrophysics: the """"Multi-Messenger"""" era. In this contribution, I will review the main results by gamma-ray experiments obtained from 2015 to 2017 during the first two observational runs of the LIGO-Virgo experiments (O1/O2), and highlight strategies and status during the current run (O3) which will cover a 1-year period starting April 2019. Finally, I will focus on future prospects for gamma-ray missions dedicated to GW counterpart studies.",0
"This study aims to develop a wearable device that collect health data from maintenance personnel and environmental conditions data in order to ensure the safety of the staff in industrial work areas where have different levels of risk categories.

This application is an important personal safety system and can prevent work accidents that may occur during maintenance or repair operations.",0
A study of band edge phenomena in ridge waveguide magnetophotonic crystals is presented. Normal mode analysis is used to examine the near-band edge and Bragg center-wavelength group velocities and their relation to the polarization. Large polarization departures from the input are observed in Bragg gratings patterned by focused-ion-beam milling on liquid-phase-epitaxial (LPE) BiLuIG films on (111) gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates. Transfer matrix analysis of the spectral response in the photonic crystals allows the determination of the phase of the elliptically polarized normal modes from measured transmittances and polarization rotation. Unlike non-birefringent Faraday rotators a non-linear-relation exists between polarization rotation and the normal mode phase difference. Large phase differences between right- and left-elliptically polarized normal modes and optical slow-down are found near the band edges and at the resonant cavity center-wavelength. Standing-wave photon trapping and optical slow-down are analyzed and compared for these systems.,0
"In this paper, we show that the low energy theorem (LET) of the threshold pion-photoproduction can be fully recovered in the quark model. An essential result of this investigation is that the quark-pion operators are obtained from the effective chiral Lagrangian, and the low energy theorem does not require the constraints on the internal structures of the nucleon. The pseudoscalar quark-pion coupling generates an additional term at order $\mu=m_{\pi}/M$ only in the isospin amplitude $A^{(-)}$. The role of the transitions between the nucleon and the resonance $P_{33}(1232)$ and P-wave baryons are also discussed, we find that the leading contributions to the isospin amplitudes at $O(\mu^2)$ are from the transition between the P-wave baryons and the nucleon and the charge radius of the nucleon. The leading contribution from the P-wave baryons only affects the neutral pion production, and improve the agreement with data significantly. The transition between the resonance $P_{33}(1232)$ and the nucleon only gives an order $\mu^3$ corrections to $A^{(-)}$.",0
"Background: The computation of the statistical properties of motif occurrences has an obviously relevant practical application: for example, patterns that are significantly over- or under-represented in the genome are interesting candidates for biological roles. However, the problem is computationally hard; as a result, virtually all the existing pipelines use fast but approximate scoring functions, in spite of the fact that they have been shown to systematically produce incorrect results. A few interesting exact approaches are known, but they are very slow and hence not practical in the case of realistic sequences. Results: We give an exact solution, solely based on deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs), to the problem of finding not only the p-value, but the whole relevant part of the Markovian probability distribution function of a motif in a biological sequence. In particular, the time complexity of the algorithm in the most interesting regimes is far better than that of Nuel (2006), which was the fastest similar exact algorithm known to date; in many cases, even approximate methods are outperformed. Conclusions: DFAs are a standard tool of computer science for the study of patterns, but so far they have been sparingly used in the study of biological motifs. Previous works do propose algorithms involving automata, but there they are used respectively as a first step to build a Finite Markov Chain Imbedding (FMCI), or to write a generating function: whereas we only rely on the concept of DFA to perform the calculations. This innovative approach can realistically be used for exact statistical studies of very long genomes and protein sequences, as we illustrate with some examples on the scale of the human genome.",0
"We consider the correlation functions in a gas of electrons moving within a thin layer on the surface of nanosize sphere. A closed form of expressions for the RKKY indirect exchange, superconducting Cooper loop and `density-density' correlation function is obtained. The systematic comparison with planar results is made, the effects of spherical geometry are outlined. The quantum coherence of electrons leads to the enhancement of all correlations for the points--antipodes on the sphere. This effect is lost when the radius of the sphere exceeds the temperature coherence length.",0
"This lecture discusses the Higgs boson sector of the SM and the MSSM, including their connection to electroweak precision physics and the searches for SM and SUSY Higgs bosons at the LHC.",0
"A classification is given for (regular) positions of direct sums of two matroid algebras (unital algebraic limits of matrix algebras) in a matroid superalgebra, where the individual summands have index 2 in their associated corner algebra. A similar classification is obtained for positions of direct sums of 2-symmetric algebras and, in the odd case, for the positions of sums of 2-symmetric C*-algebras in matroid C*-algebras. The approach relies on an analysis of intermediate non-self-adjoint operator algebras and the classifications are given in terms of K0 invariants, partial isometry homology and scales in the associated composite K0-homology group.",0
"The Sauter-Schwinger process of electron-positron pair creation from vacuum, driven by a sequence of time-dependent electric-field pulses, is studied in the framework of quantum-field theoretical approach. As demonstrated by our numerical results, the probability distributions of produced pairs exhibit intra- and inter-pulse interference structures. We show that such structures can be observed beyond the regime of applicability of the WKB theory, which was the focus of earlier investigations. Going beyond these developments, we perform the analysis of the time-evolution operator for an arbitrary eigenmode of the fermionic field. This shows that a perfect coherent enhancement of the inter-pulse peaks can never be reached. A nearly perfect coherence, on the other hand, is due to nonadiabatic transitions at avoided crossings of the phases defining the unitary time evolution. This analysis allows us to determine the conditions under which the nearly perfect coherence is lost.",0
A fractional Hamiltonian formalism is introduced for the recent combined fractional calculus of variations. The Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equation is generalized to be applicable for systems containing combined Caputo fractional derivatives. The obtained results provide tools to carry out the quantization of nonconservative problems through combined fractional canonical equations of Hamilton type.,0
"We investigate the contribution of inelastic and elastic processes to single inclusive hadron production in proton-proton and proton (deuteron)-nucleus collisions at RHIC and the LHC. Using the hybrid formulation which includes both elastic and inelastic contributions, supplemented with the running-coupling Balitsky-Kovchegov equation, we get a good description of RHIC data. It is shown that inclusion of the inelastic terms makes the transverse momentum dependence of the production cross section steeper in the mid-rapidity region but does not affect the cross section in the very forward region. The inelastic processes also lead to a sharper increase of the nuclear modification factor R_{pA} with increasing p_T. We also make predictions for the nuclear modification factor in proton-nucleus collisions at the LHC (\sqrt{s}=4.4 and 8.8 TeV) at various rapidities using the Color Glass Condensate framework.",0
"We use the automorphism group $Aut(H)$, of holes in the lattice $L_8=A_2\oplus A_2\oplus D_4$, as the starting point in the construction of sphere packings in 10 and 12 dimensions. A second lattice, $L_4=A_2\oplus A_2$, enters the construction because a subgroup of $Aut(L_4)$ is isomorphic to $Aut(H)$. The lattices $L_8$ and $L_4$, when glued together through this relationship, provide an alternative construction of the laminated lattice in twelve dimensions with kissing number 648. More interestingly, the action of $Aut(H)$ on $L_4$ defines a pair of invariant planes through which dense, non-lattice packings in 10 dimensions can be constructed. The most symmetric of these is aperiodic with center density 1/32. These constructions were prompted by an unexpected arrangement of 378 kissing spheres discovered by a search algorithm.",0
"The user-level brokers in grids consider individual application QoS requirements and minimize their cost without considering demands from other users. This results in contention for resources and sub-optimal schedules. Meta-scheduling in grids aims to address this scheduling problem, which is NP hard due to its combinatorial nature. Thus, many heuristic-based solutions using Genetic Algorithm (GA) have been proposed, apart from traditional algorithms such as Greedy and FCFS. We propose a Linear Programming/Integer Programming model (LP/IP) for scheduling these applications to multiple resources. We also propose a novel algorithm LPGA (Linear programming driven Genetic Algorithm) which combines the capabilities of LP and GA. The aim of this algorithm is to obtain the best metaschedule for utility grids which minimize combined cost of all users in a coordinated manner. Simulation results show that our proposed integrated algorithm offers the best schedule having the minimum processing cost with negligible time overhead.",0
"The CALICE collaboration is currently developing an engineering prototype of an analog hadron calorimeter for a future linear collider detector. It is based on scintillating tiles that are individually read out by silicon photomultipliers. The prototype will contain about 2500 detector channels, which corresponds to one calorimeter layer and aims at demonstrating the feasibility of building a detector with fully integrated front-end electronics. The concept and engineering status of the prototype, as well as results from the DESY test setups are reported here.",0
The rigidity theorem for homotopy invariant presheaves with Witt-transfers on the category of smooth affine varieties over a field $k$ with characteristic not equal to 2 is proved. Namely for such a presheaf $\mathcal F$ the isomorphism $\mathcal F(U)\simeq \mathcal F(x)$ where $U$ is henseliation of a variety at smooth closed point with separable residue field (over $k$) is proved. The rigidity for presheaves $W^i(X\times -)$ where $X$ is smooth variety and $W^i(-)$ are derived Witt-groups ($i\in \mathbb Z/4\mathbb Z$) follows as corollary.,0
"The extension of the standard model to $SU(3)_L\times SU(3)_R \times SU(3)_C$ is considered. Spontaneous symmetry breaking requires two $(3^*, 3, 1)$ Higgs field multiplets with a strong hierarchical structure of their vacuum expectation values. An invariant potential is constructed to provide for these vacuum expectation values. This potential gives masses to all scalar fields apart from the 15 Goldstone bosons. In case there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the vacuum expectation values of the two field multiplets, the scalar boson spectrum contains degenerate eigenstates. The lowest eigenstate has a mass near 123 GeV close to the Higgs-like particle discovered at the LHC. In one class of solutions this lowest state is a nearly degenerate twin state. Each member is a superposition of fields from both multiplets with about equal strength. The twins are non identical twins, namely different combinations of a conventional Higgs and a Higgs field which is not coupled to fermions, only to gauge bosons. A second class of solutions leads again to degenerate states but in this case the state near 123 GeV remains a single state even for identical low scale vacuum expectation values in both multiplets.",0
"We present a general analytical formula and an ab initio study of quantum interference in multi-branch molecules. Ab initio calculations are used to investigate quantum interference in a benzene-1,2-dithiolate (BDT) molecule sandwiched between gold electrodes and through oligoynes of various lengths. We show that when a point charge is located in the plane of a BDT molecule and its position varied, the electrical conductance exhibits a clear interference effect, whereas when the charge approaches a BDT molecule along a line normal to the plane of the molecule and passing through the centre of the phenyl ring, interference effects are negligible. In the case of olygoynes, quantum interference leads to the appearance of a critical energy $E_c$, at which the electron transmission coefficient $T(E)$ of chains with even or odd numbers of atoms is independent of length. To illustrate the underlying physics, we derive a general analytical formula for electron transport through multi-branch structures and demonstrate the versatility of the formula by comparing it with the above ab-initio simulations. We also employ the analytical formula to investigate the current inside the molecule and demonstrate that large counter currents can occur within a ring-like molecule such as BDT, when the point charge is located in the plane of the molecule. The formula can be used to describe quantum interference and Fano resonances in structures with branches containing arbitrary elastic scattering regions connected to nodal sites.",0
"We prove a uniform in bandwidth law of the iterated logarithm for the maximal deviation of kernel copula estimators from their expectations. We deal especially with the \textit{local linear}, the \textit{mirror-reflection} and the \textit{transformation} estimators. These results are useful for establishing the strong uniform in bandwidth consistency of these kernel estimators.",0
"This paper has partially a novel and partially a survey character. We start with a short review of rack (two term) homology of self distributive algebraic structures (shelves) and their connections to knot theory. We concentrate on a sub-family of quandles satisfying the graphic axiom. For a large family of graphic quandles (including infinite ones), we compute the second rack homology groups. Finally, we propose conjectures based on our computational data.",0
"Predictions of cross sections and analyzing powers using g-folding optical potentials for the scattering of 71A MeV 6,8He ions from (polarized) hydrogen are compared with data. A g-folding model in which exchange amplitudes are evaluated explicitly was used with wave functions of 6,8He specified from a no-core shell model that used a complete (0+2+4)hw basis. The analyzing powers reveal some sensitivities to the details of the wave functions, especially in the case of halo nuclei.",0
"The support vector machine (SVM) is a powerful and widely used classification algorithm. This paper uses the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions to provide rigorous mathematical proof for new insights into the behavior of SVM. These insights provide perhaps unexpected relationships between SVM and two other linear classifiers: the mean difference and the maximal data piling direction. For example, we show that in many cases SVM can be viewed as a cropped version of these classifiers. By carefully exploring these connections we show how SVM tuning behavior is affected by characteristics including: balanced vs. unbalanced classes, low vs. high dimension, separable vs. non-separable data. These results provide further insights into tuning SVM via cross-validation by explaining observed pathological behavior and motivating improved cross-validation methodology. Finally, we also provide new results on the geometry of complete data piling directions in high dimensional space.",0
"In our previous work [Chen el al., J. Comput. Phys., 373(2018)], the quadratic Wasserstein metric is successfully applied to the earthquake location problem. The actual earthquake hypocenter can be accurately recovered starting from initial values very far from the true ones. However, the seismic wave signals need to be normalized since the quadratic Wasserstein metric requires mass conservation. This brings a critical difficulty. Since the amplitude of a seismogram at a receiver is a good representation of the distance between the source and the receiver, simply normalizing the signals will cause the objective function in optimization process to be insensitive to the distance between the source and the receiver. When the data is contaminated with strong noise, the minimum point of the objective function will deviate and lead to a low accurate location result. To overcome the difficulty mentioned above, we apply the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao (WFR) metric [Chizat et al., Found. Comput. Math., 18(2018)] to the earthquake location problem. The WFR metric is one of the newly developed metric in the unbalanced Optimal Transport theory. It does not require the normalization of the seismic signals. Thus, the amplitude of seismograms can be considered as a new constraint, which can substantially improve the sensitivity of the objective function to the distance between the source and the receiver. As a result, we can expect more accurate location results from the WFR metric based method compare to those based on quadratic Wasserstein metric under high-intensity noise. The numerical examples also demonstrate this.",0
"Recursive Neural Networks are non-linear adaptive models that are able to learn deep structured information. However, these models have not yet been broadly accepted. This fact is mainly due to its inherent complexity. In particular, not only for being extremely complex information processing models, but also because of a computational expensive learning phase. The most popular training method for these models is back-propagation through the structure. This algorithm has been revealed not to be the most appropriate for structured processing due to problems of convergence, while more sophisticated training methods enhance the speed of convergence at the expense of increasing significantly the computational cost. In this paper, we firstly perform an analysis of the underlying principles behind these models aimed at understanding their computational power. Secondly, we propose an approximate second order stochastic learning algorithm. The proposed algorithm dynamically adapts the learning rate throughout the training phase of the network without incurring excessively expensive computational effort. The algorithm operates in both on-line and batch modes. Furthermore, the resulting learning scheme is robust against the vanishing gradients problem. The advantages of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated with a real-world application example.",0
"It is shown that the geometry of multi-electron threshold ionization in atoms depends on the initial configuration of bound electrons. The reason for this behavior is found in the stability properties of the classical fixed point of the equations of motion for multiple threshold fragmentation. Specifically for three-electron break-up, apart from the symmetric triangular configuration also a break-up of lower symmetry in the form of a T-shape can occur, as we demonstrate by calculating triple photoionization for the lithium ground and first excited states. We predict the electron break-up geometry for threshold fragmentation experiments.",0
"The local dynamical features of a PEO melt studied by MD simulations are compared to two model chain systems, namely the well-known Rouse model as well as the semiflexible chain model (SFCM) that additionally incorporates chain stiffness. Apart from the analysis of rather general quantities such as the mean square displacement (MSD), we present a new statistical method to extract the local bead mobility from the simulation data on the basis of the Langevin equation, thus providing a complementary approach to the classical Rouse-mode analysis. This allows us to check the validity of the Langevin equation and, as a consequence, the Rouse model. Moreover, the new method has a broad range of applications for the analysis of the dynamics of more complex polymeric systems like comb-branched polymers or polymer blends.",0
"In May 2008, the Antares neutrino telescope was completed at 2.5 km depth in the Mediterranean Sea; data taking has been going on since. A prerequisite for neutrino astronomy is an accurate reconstruction of the neutrino events, as well as a detailed understanding of the atmospheric muon and neutrino backgrounds. Several methods have been developed to confront the challenges of muon reconstruction in the sea water environment, which are posed by e.g. backgrounds due to radioactivity and bioluminescence. I will discuss the techniques that allowed Antares to confidently identify its first neutrino events, as well as recent results on the measurement of atmospheric neutrinos.",0
"Let $G$ be a simply connected semisimple algebraic group over $\mathbb{C}$ and let $\rho :G\rightarrow GL(V_\lambda)$ be an irreducible representation of highest weight $\lambda$. Suppose that $\rho$ has finite kernel. Springer defined adjoint-invariant regular map with Zariski dense image from the group to its Lie algebra, $\theta_\lambda:G\rightarrow\mathfrak{g}$, which depends on $\lambda$ [Kumar]. By a lemma in Kumar's recent paper, $\theta_\lambda$ takes the maximal torus to its Lie algebra $\mathfrak{t}$. Thus, for a given simple group $G$ and an irreducible representation $V_\lambda$, one may write $\theta_\lambda (t)=\sum\limits_{i=1}^n c_i(t)\check{\alpha_i}$, where the simple co-roots $\{\check{\alpha_i}\}$ are a basis for $\mathfrak{t}$. We give a complete determination of these coefficients $c_i(t)$ for any simple group $G$ as a sum over the weights of the torus action on $V_\lambda$.",0
"We investigate the dynamics of the Papapetrou equations in Kerr spacetime. These equations provide a model for the motion of a relativistic spinning test particle orbiting a rotating (Kerr) black hole. We perform a thorough parameter space search for signs of chaotic dynamics by calculating the Lyapunov exponents for a large variety of initial conditions. We find that the Papapetrou equations admit many chaotic solutions, with the strongest chaos occurring in the case of eccentric orbits with pericenters close to the limit of stability against plunge into a maximally spinning Kerr black hole. Despite the presence of these chaotic solutions, we show that physically realistic solutions to the Papapetrou equations are not chaotic; in all cases, the chaotic solutions either do not correspond to realistic astrophysical systems, or involve a breakdown of the test-particle approximation leading to the Papapetrou equations (or both). As a result, the gravitational radiation from bodies spiraling into much more massive black holes (as detectable, for example, by LISA, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) should not exhibit any signs of chaos.",0
"This paper shows some criteria for a scheme of finite type over an algebraically closed field to be non-singular in terms of jet schemes. For the base field of characteristic zero, the scheme is non-singular if and only if one of the truncation morphisms of its jet schemes is flat. For the positive characteristic case, we obtain a similar characterization under the reducedness condition on the scheme. We also obtain by a simple discussion that the scheme is non-singular if and only if one of its jet schemes is non-singular.",0

"We introduce a class of operators on abstract measure spaces, which unifies the Calder\'on-Zygmund operators on spaces of homogeneous type, the maximal functions and the martingale transforms.

Applying these estimates, we improve several results obtained by different authors in recent years.",0
"Crowdsourcing offers a practical method for ranking and scoring large amounts of items. To investigate the algorithms and incentives that can be used in crowdsourcing quality evaluations, we built CrowdGrader, a tool that lets students submit and collaboratively grade solutions to homework assignments. We present the algorithms and techniques used in CrowdGrader, and we describe our results and experience in using the tool for several computer-science assignments. CrowdGrader combines the student-provided grades into a consensus grade for each submission using a novel crowdsourcing algorithm that relies on a reputation system. The algorithm iterativerly refines inter-dependent estimates of the consensus grades, and of the grading accuracy of each student. On synthetic data, the algorithm performs better than alternatives not based on reputation. On our preliminary experimental data, the performance seems dependent on the nature of review errors, with errors that can be ascribed to the reviewer being more tractable than those arising from random external events. To provide an incentive for reviewers, the grade each student receives in an assignment is a combination of the consensus grade received by their submissions, and of a reviewing grade capturing their reviewing effort and accuracy. This incentive worked well in practice.",0
"Caloric curves have traditionally been derived within the microcanonical ensemble via dS/dE=1/T or within the canonical ensemble via E=T^2*d(ln Z)/dT. In the thermodynamical limit, i.e., for large systems, both caloric curves give the same result. For small systems like nuclei, the two caloric curves are in general different from each other and neither one is reasonable. Using dS/dE=1/T, spurious structures like negative temperatures and negative heat capacities can occur and have indeed been discussed in the literature. Using E=T^2*d(ln Z)/dT a very featureless caloric curve is obtained which generally smoothes too much over structural changes in the system. A new approach for caloric curves based on the two-dimensional probability distribution P(E,T) will be discussed.",0
We define a quantitative constraint language subsuming two calculi well-known in QSR (Qualitative Spatial Reasoning): Frank's cone-shaped and projection-based calculi of cardinal direction relations. We show how to solve a CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem) expressed in the language.,0
"In this paper, we consider a leader-following consensus problem of a group of autonomous agents with time-varying coupling delays. Two different cases of coupling topologies are investigated. At first, a necessary and sufficient condition is proved in the case when the interconnection topology is fixed and directed. Then a sufficient condition is proposed in the case when the coupling topology is switched and balanced. Numerical examples are also given to illustrate our results.",0
File carving is one of the most important procedures in Digital Forensic Investigation (DFI). But it is also requires the most computational resources. Parallel processing on Graphics Processing Units have proven to be many times faster than when executed on standard CPU. This paper is inspecting the algorithms and methods to use parallel processing for development of file carving tools that will do their job much faster than the conventional DFI tools.,0
"Maxwell's multipoles are a natural geometric characterisation of real functions on the sphere (with fixed $\ell$). The correlations between multipoles for gaussian random functions are calculated, by mapping the spherical functions to random polynomials. In the limit of high $\ell,$ the 2-point function tends to a form previously derived by Hannay in the analogous problem for the Majorana sphere. The application to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is discussed.",0
"It is shown how a C*-algebra representation of the transformations of a physical system can be derived from two operational postulates: 1) the existence of dynamically independent systems}; 2) the existence of symmetric faithful states. Both notions are crucial for the possibility of performing experiments on the system, in preventing remote instantaneous influences and in allowing calibration of apparatuses. The case of Quantum Mechanics is thoroughly analyzed. The possibility that other no-signaling theories admit a C*-algebra formulation is discussed.",0
"Over the past years, TCP has gone through numerous updates to provide performance enhancement under diverse network conditions. However, with respect to losses, little can be achieved with legacy TCP detection and recovery mechanisms. Both fast retransmission and retransmission timeout take at least one extra round trip time to perform, and this might significantly impact performance of latency-sensitive applications, especially in lossy or high delay networks. While forward error correction (FEC) is not a new initiative in this direction, the majority of the approaches consider FEC inside the application. In this paper, we design and implement a framework, where FEC is integrated within TCP. Our main goal with this design choice is to enable latency sensitive applications over TCP in high delay and lossy networks, but remaining application agnostic. We further incorporate this design into multipath TCP (MPTCP), where we focus particularly on heterogeneous settings, considering the fact that TCP recovery mechanisms further escalate head-of-line blocking in multipath. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework and show that such a framework can bring significant benefits compared to legacy TCP and MPTCP for latency-sensitive real application traffic, such as video streaming and web services.",0
"We obtain distances to a sample of RR Lyrae in the central core of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy from OGLE data. We use these distances, along with RR Lyrae from \emph{Gaia} DR2, to measure the shape of the stellar distribution within the central $\sim$ 2 kpc. The best-fit stellar distribution is triaxial, with axis ratios 1 : 0.76 : 0.43. A prolate spheroid model is ruled out at high statistical significance relative to the triaxial model. The major axis is aligned nearly parallel to the sky plane as seen by an Earth-based observer and is nearly perpendicular to the direction of the Galactic center. This result may be compared to cosmological simulations which generally predict that the major axis of the dark matter distribution of subhalos is aligned with the Galactic center. The triaxial structure that we obtain can provide important constraints on the Sagittarius progenitor, as well as the central dark matter distribution under the assumption of dynamical equilibrium.",0

"We present a probabilistic approach to water-water hydrogen bonding that allows one to obtain an analytic expression for the number of bonds per water molecule as a function of both its distance to a hydrophobic particle and hydrophobe radius. This approach can be used in the density functional theory (DFT) and computer simulations to examine particle size effects on the hydration of particles and on their solvent-mediated interaction. For example, it allows one to explicitly identify a water hydrogen bond contribution to the external potential whereto a water molecule is subjected near a hydrophobe. The DFT implementation of the model predicts the hydration free energy per unit area of a spherical hydrophobe to be sharply sensitive to the hydropobe radius for small radii and weakly sensitive thereto for large ones; this corroborates the vision of the hydration of small and large length-scale particles as occurring via different mechanisms. On the other hand, the model predicts that the hydration of even apolar particles of small enough radii may become thermodynamically favorable owing to the interplay of the energies of pairwise (dispersion) water-water and water-hydrophobe interactions. This sheds light on previous counterintuitive observations (both theoretical and simulational) that two inert gas molecules would prefer to form a solvent-separated pair rather than a contact one.",0
"We present Keck spectroscopic measurements of the millisecond pulsar binary J2215+5135. These data indicate a neutron-star (NS) mass M_NS=1.6Mo, much less than previously estimated. The pulsar heats the companion face to T_D~9000K; the large heating efficiency may be mediated by the intrabinary shock dominating the X-ray light curve. At the best-fit inclination i=88.8deg, the pulsar should be eclipsed. We find weak evidence for such eclipses in the pulsed gamma-rays; an improved radio ephemeris allows use of up to 5 times more Fermi-LAT gamma-ray photons for a definitive test of this picture. If confirmed, the gamma-ray eclipse provides a novel probe of the dense companion wind and the pulsar magnetosphere.",0
"These lectures provide an introduction to Soft-Collinear Effective Theory. After discussing the expansion of Feynman diagrams around the high-energy limit, the effective Lagrangian is constructed, first for a scalar theory, then for QCD. The underlying concepts are illustrated with the Sudakov form factor, i.e. the quark vector form factor at large momentum transfer. We then apply the formalism in two examples: We perform soft gluon resummation as well as transverse-momentum resummation for the Drell-Yan process using renormalization group evolution in SCET, and we derive the infrared structure of n-point gauge theory amplitudes by relating them to effective theory operators. We conclude with an overview of the different applications of the effective theory.",0
"In an earlier paper, we presented the first evidence for a bow-shock nebula surrounding the X-ray binary LMC X-1 on a scale of ~15 pc, which we argued was powered by a jet associated with an accretion disk. We now present the first evidence for an ionization cone extending from an X-ray binary, a phenomenon only seen to date in active galactic nuclei (AGN). The ionization cone, detected in the HeII4686/Hbeta and [OIII]5007/Hbeta line ratio maps, aligns with the direction of the jet inferred from the bow-shock nebula. The cone has an opening angle ~45 deg and radial extent ~3.8 pc. Since the HeII emission cannot be explained by the companion O star, the gas in the ionization cone must be exposed to the `naked' accretion disk, thereby allowing us to place constraints on the unobservable ionizing spectrum. The energetics of the ionization cone give unambiguous evidence for an """"ultraviolet - soft X-ray"""" (XUV) excess in LMC X-1. Any attempt to match the hard X-ray spectrum (>1keV) with a conventional model of the accretion disk fails to account for this XUV component. We propose two likely sources for the observed anisotropy: (1) obscuration by a dusty torus, or (2) a jet-blown hole in a surrounding envelope of circumstellar absorbing material. We discuss the implications of our discovery in the context of the mass-scaling hypothesis for accretion onto black holes and suggest avenues for future research.",0
The generalized dynamics describing the propagation of neutral kaons in randomly fluctuating media is derived and analyzed. It takes into account possible matter-induced effects leading to loss of phase coherence and dissipation. The study of selected neutral kaon observables indicates that these non-standard effects are amenable to a direct experimental analysis.,0
"Suppose that $N$ is a smooth manifold with a smooth Riemannian metric $g_0$, and that $\Gamma$ is a smooth submanifold of $N$. This paper proves that for a generic (in the sense of Baire category) smooth metric $g$ conformal to $g_0$, if $F$ is any simple $g$-minimal immersion of a closed manifold into N, then $F$ is transverse to $\Gamma$ and $F$ is self-transverse. The theorem remains true with """"transverse"""" and """"self-transverse"""" replaced by """"strongly transverse"""" and """"strongly self-transverse"""". The theorem also holds for hypersurfaces of constant mean curvature or, more generally, of prescribed mean curvature.",0
"IC 2144 is a small reflection nebula located in the zone of avoidance near the Galactic anticenter. It has been investigated here largely on the basis of Keck/HIRES optical spectroscopy (R ~ 48,000) and a SpeX spectrogram in the near-IR (R = 2000) obtained at the NASA IRTF. The only star in the nebula that is obvious in the optical or near-IR is the peculiar emission-line object MWC 778 (V = 12.8), which resembles a T Tauri star in some respects. What appear to be F- or G-type absorption features are detectable in its optical region under the very complex emission line spectrum; their radial velocity agrees with the CO velocity of the larger cloud in which IC 2144 is embedded. There are significant differences between the spectrum of the brightest area of the nebula and of MWC 778, the presumed illuminator, an issue discussed in some detail. The distance of IC 2144 is inferred to be about 1.0 kpc by reference to other star-forming regions in the vicinity. The extinction is large, as demonstrated by [Fe II] emission line ratios in the near-IR and by the strength of the diffuse interstellar band spectrum; a provisional value of A_V of 3.0 mag was assumed. The SED of MWC 778 rises steeply beyond about 1 $\mu$m, with a slope characteristic of a Class I source. Integration of the flux distribution leads to an IR luminosity of about 510 L_solar. If MWC 778 is indeed a F- or G-type pre--main-sequence star several magnitudes above the ZAMS, a population of faint emission Halpha stars would be expected in the vicinity. Such a search, like other investigations that are recommended in this paper, has yet to be carried out.",0
"Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave activity is ubiquitous in the solar atmosphere. MHD seismology aims to determine difficult to measure physical parameters in solar atmospheric magnetic and plasma structures by a combination of observed and theoretical properties of MHD waves and oscillations. This technique, similar to seismology or helio-seismology, demands the solution of two problems. The direct problem involves the computation of wave properties of given theoretical models. The inverse problem implies the calculation of unknown physical parameters, by means of a comparison of observed and theoretical wave properties. Solar atmospheric seismology has been successfully applied to different structures such as coronal loops, prominence fine structures, spicules, or jets. However, it is still in its infancy. Far more is there to come. We present an overview of recent results, with particular emphasis in the inversion procedure.",0
"Context. High-precision pulsar-timing experiments are affected by temporal variations of the Dispersion Measure (DM), which are related to spatial variations in the interstellar electron content. Correcting for DM variations relies on the cold-plasma dispersion law which states that the dispersive delay varies with the squared inverse of the observing frequency. This may however give incorrect measurements if the probed electron content (and therefore the DM) varies with observing frequency, as is predicted theoretically. Aims. We study small-scale density variations in the ionised interstellar medium. These structures may lead to frequency-dependent DMs in pulsar signals and could inhibit the use of lower-frequency pulsar observations to correct time-variable interstellar dispersion in higher-frequency pulsar-timing data. Methods. We used high-cadence, low-frequency observations with three stations from the German LOng-Wavelength (GLOW) consortium, which are part of the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR). Specifically, 3.5 years of weekly observations of PSR J2219+4754 are presented. Results. We present the first detection of frequency-dependent DMs towards any interstellar object and a precise multi-year time-series of the time- and frequency-dependence of the measured DMs. The observed DM variability is significant and may be caused by extreme scattering events. Potential causes for frequency-dependent DMs are quantified and evaluated. Conclusions. We conclude that frequency-dependence of DMs has been reliably detected and is caused by small-scale (up to 10s of AUs) but steep density variations in the interstellar electron content. We find that long-term trends in DM variability equally affect DMs measured at both ends of our frequency band and hence the negative impact on long-term high-precision timing projects is expected to be limited.",0
"In random-matrix ensembles that interpolate between the three basic ensembles (orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic), there exist correlations between elements of the same eigenvector and between different eigenvectors. We study such correlations, using a remarkable correspondence between the interpolating ensembles late in the crossover and a basic ensemble of finite size. In small metal grains or semiconductor quantum dots, the correlations between different eigenvectors lead to enhanced fluctuations of the electron-electron interaction matrix elements which become parametrically larger than the non-universal fluctuations.",0

"A result by C. C.-A. Cheng, J. H. Mckay and S. S.-S. Wang says the following: Suppose the Jacobian of $A$ and $B$ is invertible in $\mathbb{C}[x,y]$ and the Jacobian of $A$ and $w$ is zero for $A,B,w \in \mathbb{C}[x,y]$. Then $w \in \mathbb{C}[A]$. We show that in CMW's result it is possible to replace $\mathbb{C}$ by any field of characteristic zero, and we conjecture the following 'two-dimensional Centralizer Conjecture over $D$': Suppose the Jacobian of $A$ and $B$ is invertible in $D[x,y]$ and the Jacobian of $A$ and $w$ is zero for $A,B,w \in D[x,y]$, $D$ is an integral domain of characteristic zero. Then $w \in D[A]$. We show that if the famous two-dimensional Jacobian Conjecture is true, then the two-dimensional Centralizer Conjecture is true.",0
"We used the internal conversion ($E_0$ transition) of germanium-72 to indirectly measure the low energy nuclear recoils of germanium. Together with a reliable Monte Carlo package, in which we implement the internal conversion process, the data was compared to the Lindhard ($k$=0.159) and Barker-Mei models. A shape analysis indicates that both models agree well with data in the region of interest within 4%. The most probable value (MPV) of the nuclear recoils obtained from the shape analysis is 17.5 keV with an average path-length of 0.014 $\mu$m.",0
"The integrable structure of the two dimensional superconformal field theory is considered. The classical counterpart of our constructions is based on the $\hat{osp}(1|2)$ super-KdV hierarchy. The quantum version of the monodromy matrix associated with the linear problem for the corresponding L-operator is introduced. Using the explicit form of the irreducible representations of $\hat{osp}_q(1|2)$, the so-called """"fusion relations"""" for the transfer matrices considered in different representations of $\hat{osp}_q(1|2)$ are obtained.

"We present new z- and H-band photometry and proper motion measurements for the five candidate very-low-mass T-type objects we recently proposed to be members of the nearest OB association to the Sun, Upper Scorpius. These new data fail to corroborate our prior conclusions regarding their spectral types and affiliation with the Upper Scorpius population. We conclude that we may be in presence of a turnover in the mass function of Upper Sco taking place below 10-4 Jupiter masses, depending on the age assigned to Upper Sco and the models used.",0
"The critical dynamics of relaxational stochastic models with nonconserved $n$-component order parameter $\bm{\phi}$ and no coupling to other slow variables (""""model A"""") is investigated in film geometries for the cases of periodic and free boundary conditions. The Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}$ governing the stationary equilibrium distribution is taken to be O(n) symmetric and to involve, in the case of free boundary conditions, the boundary terms $\int_{\mathfrak{B}_j}\mathring{c}_j \phi^2/2$ associated with the two confining surface planes $\mathfrak{B}_j$, $j=1,2$, at $z=0$ and $z=L$, where the enhancement variables $\mathring{c}_j$ are presumed to be subcritical or critical. A field-theoretic RG study of the dynamic critical behavior at $d=4-\epsilon$ bulk dimensions is presented, with special attention paid to the cases where the classical theories involve zero modes at $T_{c,\infty}$. This applies when either both $\mathring{c}_j$ take the critical value $\mathring{c}_{\text{sp}}$ associated with the special surface transition, or else periodic boundary conditions are imposed. Owing to the zero modes, the $\epsilon$ expansion becomes ill-defined at $T_{c,\infty}$. Analogously to the static case, the field theory can be reorganized to obtain a well-defined small-$\epsilon$ expansion involving half-integer powers of $\epsilon$, modulated by powers of $\ln\epsilon$. Explicit results for the scaling functions of $T$-dependent finite-size susceptibilities at temperatures $T\ge T_{c,\infty}$ and of layer and surface susceptibilities at the bulk critical point are given to orders $\epsilon$ and $\epsilon^{3/2}$, respectively. For the case of periodic boundary conditions, the consistency of the expansions to $O(\epsilon^{3/2})$ with exact large-$n$ results is shown.",0
"With this work we start a project of calculating the QED contribution of order $\alpha^7m$ to the $2^3P$-$2^3S$ transition energy in helium, aiming for an accurate determination of the nuclear charge radius $r_E$ from measurements of the corresponding transition frequency. Together with the complementary determination of $r_E$ from muonic helium, this project will provide a stringent test of universality of electromagnetic interactions of leptons in the Standard Model. We report a calculation of the relativistic corrections to the Bethe logarithm for the $2^3S$ and $2^3P$ states, which is the most numerically demanding part of the project.",0
"A method suitable for extracting resonance parameters of unstable baryons in lattice QCD is examined. The method is applied to the strong decay of the Delta to a pion-nucleon state, extracting the pion-nucleon - Delta coupling constant and Delta decay width.",0
"Photon-counting computed tomography (PCCT) with energy discrimination capabilities hold great potentials to improve the limitations of the conventional CT, including better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), improved contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), lower radiation dose, and most importantly, simultaneous multiple material identification. One potential way of material identification is via calculation of effective atomic number and effective electron density from PCCT image data. However, the current methods for calculating effective atomic number and effective electron density from PCCT image data are mostly based on semi-empirical models and accordingly are not sufficiently accurate. Here, we present a physics-based model to calculate the effective atomic number and effective electron density of various matters, including single element substances, molecular compounds, and multi-material mixtures as well. The model was validated over several materials under various combinations of energy bins. A PCCT system was simulated to generate the PCCT image data, and the proposed model was applied to the PCCT image data. Our model yielded a relative standard deviations for effective atomic numbers and effective electron densities at less than 1%. Our results further showed that five different materials can be simultaneously identified and well separated in a effective atomic number - effective electron density map. The model could serve as a basis for simultaneous material identification from PCCT.",0
We construct a massive non-abelian N= 1 SYM theory on R^3. This is achieved by using a non-local gauge and Poincare invariant mass term for gluons due to Nair. The underlying supersymmetry algebra is shown to be a non-central extension of the Poincare algebra by the spacetime rotation group so(3). The incorporation of Chern-Simons couplings in the formalism is also presented. The dimensional reduction of the gauge theory and the SUSY algebra is related to a massive N=2 massive matrix quantum mechanics based on euclidean $Clifford_2(R)$.,0
This short note aims to give an insight to Arveson's boundary theorem by means of non-commutative Poisson boundaries and its applications.,0
"Semi-exclusive and exclusive processes are becoming more and more important in high energy physics since they are excellently suited to study the internal hadronic structure. To analyze such processes the knowledge of the hadron distribution amplitudes, which are universal for different reactions, is essential. Only rather indirect information on these nonperturbative functions can be obtained from measurements. In this work we report on a lattice QCD computation of moments of nucleon distribution amplitudes using suitable three-quark operators. However, these operators have to be renormalized and the mixing is even more complicated than in the continuum. Using the symmetry group of the hypercubic lattice we therefore derive and implement irreducibly transforming three-quark operators, which allow us to control the mixing pattern and will finally lead to quantitative predictions in the MSbar scheme. We present preliminary results for leading-twist and next-to-leading twist nucleon distribution amplitudes based on the QCDSF/UKQCD simulations with 2 flavors of dynamical clover fermions.",0
"We prove that the length function for perverse sheaves and algebraic regular holonomic D-modules on a smooth complex algebraic variety Y is an absolute Q-constructible function. One consequence is: for """"any"""" fixed natural (derived) functor F between constructible complexes or perverse sheaves on two smooth varieties X and Y, the loci of rank one local systems L on X whose image F(L) has prescribed length are Zariski constructible subsets defined over Q, obtained from finitely many torsion-translated complex affine algebraic subtori of the moduli of rank one local systems via a finite sequence of taking union, intersection, and complement.",0
"We consider a reconciliation problem, where two hosts wish to synchronize their respective sets. Efficient solutions for minimizing the communication cost between the two hosts have been previously proposed in the literature. However, they rely on prior knowledge about the size of the set differences between the two sets to be reconciled. In this paper, we propose a method which can achieve comparable efficiency without assuming this prior knowledge. Our method uses compressive sensing techniques which can leverage the expected sparsity in set differences. We study the performance of the method via theoretical analysis and numerical simulations.",0
"We study theoretically the resonant inelastic x-ray scattering in quasi-one-dimensional insulating copper oxides, where the incident photon energy is tuned to the Cu1s-4p absorption energy. Our attention is focused particularly on the strong momentum-transfer dependence of the spectral shape observed in recent experiments. We describe the antiferromagnetic ground state within the Hartree-Fock theory, and consider charge excitations from the ground state within the random phase approximation. By taking account of the electron correlation effects perturbatively, we obtain detailed momentum-transfer dependence of the spectra in a semiquantitative agreement with the experiments.",0
"We investigate the localization properties of atoms moving in a three-dimensional optical lattice in the presence of an uncorrelated disorder potential having the same probability distribution $P(V)$ as laser speckles. We find that the disorder-averaged (single-particle) Green's function, calculated via the coherent potential approximation, is in very good agreement with exact numerics. Using the transfer-matrix method, we compute the phase diagram in the energy-disorder plane and show that its peculiar shape can be understood from the self-consistent theory of localization. In particular, we recover the large asymmetry in the position of the mobility edge for blue and red speckles, which was recently observed numerically for correlated speckle potentials.",0
"Most states in the Hilbert space are maximally entangled. This fact has proven useful to investigate - among other things - the foundations of statistical mechanics. Unfortunately, most states in the Hilbert space of a quantum many body system are not physically accessible. We define physical ensembles of states by acting on random factorized states by a circuit of length k of random and independent unitaries with local support. We study the typicality of entanglement by means of the purity of the reduced state. We find that for a time k=O(1) the typical purity obeys the area law. Thus, the upper bounds for area law are actually saturated {\em in average}, with a variance that goes to zero for large systems. Similarly, we prove that by means of local evolution a subsystem of linear dimensions $L$ is typically entangled with a volume law when the time scales with the size of the subsystem. Moreover, we show that for large values of k the reduced state becomes very close to the completely mixed state.",0
"We propose to utilize symmetry-protected zero modes of a photonic lattice to realize a single-mode, fixed-frequency, and spatially tunable laser. These properties are the consequence of the underlying non-Hermitian particle-hole symmetry, with which the energy spectrum satisfies $\varepsilon_m=-\varepsilon_n^*$. Unlike in the Hermitian case, the symmetric phase of particle-hole symmetry is no longer restricted to $\varepsilon=0$ but extends along the imaginary-$\varepsilon$ axis, which is set by the single-cavity frequency and symmetry-protected against position and coupling disorder of the photonic lattice. By selectively pumping different cavities in the photonic lattice, we control the spontaneous symmetry restoration process, which provides a convenient method to tune the spatial profile of the laser without changing its frequency.",0
"We exactely calculate the inclusive transverse momentum (kt) distributions and the 2-particle momentum correlations in high energy hadronic jets at the Modified Leading Logarithmic Approximation (MLLA) of QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics). We first obtain the exact solution of the evolution equations at """"small x"""", which we calculate at the so called """"limiting spectrum"""". We then go beyond this approximation by performing the steepest descent evaluation, which allows to generalize the preceeding results. Our predictions are in good agreement with the data (LEP, Tevatron) and improve those which have been obtained in the past. The comparison with forthcoming data (Tevatron, LHC) will further test the hypothesis of Local Hadron Parton Duality, and the eventual need to incorporate NMLLA corrections.",0
"We prove that the class of permutations generated by passing an ordered sequence $12\dots n$ through a stack of depth 2 and an infinite stack in series is in bijection with an unambiguous context-free language, where a permutation of length $n$ is encoded by a string of length $3n$. It follows that the sequence counting the number of permutations of each length has an algebraic generating function. We use the explicit context-free language to compute the generating function: \begin{align*} \sum_{n\geq 0} c_n t^n &= \frac{(1+q)\left(1+5q-q^2-q^3-(1-q)\sqrt{(1-q^2)(1-4q-q^2)}\right)}{8q} \end{align*} where $c_n$ is the number of permutations of length $n$ that can be generated, and $q \equiv q(t) = \frac{1-2t-\sqrt{1-4t}}{2t}$ is a simple variant of the Catalan generating function. This in turn implies that $c_n^{1/n} \to 2+2\sqrt{5}$.",0
"A general search is presented for a low-mass $\tau^-\tau^+$ resonance produced in association with a bottom quark. The search is based on proton-proton collision data at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb$^{-1}$. The data are consistent with the standard model expectation. Upper limits at 95% confidence level on the cross section times branching fraction are determined for two signal models: a light pseudoscalar Higgs boson decaying to a pair of $\tau$ leptons produced in association with bottom quarks, and a low-mass boson X decaying to a $\tau$-lepton pair that is produced in the decay of a bottom-like quark B such that B $\to$ bX. Masses between 25 and 70 GeV are probed for the light pseudoscalar boson with upper limits ranging from 250 to 44 pb. Upper limits from 20 to 0.3 pb are set on B masses between 170 and 450 GeV for X boson masses between 20 and 70 GeV.",0
"Clinical diffusion imaging requires short acquisition times and good image quality to permit its use in various medical applications. In turn, these demands require the development of a robust and efficient post-processing framework in order to guarantee useful and reliable results. However, multiple artefacts abound in in vivo measurements; from either subject such as cardiac pulsation, bulk head motion, respiratory motion and involuntary tics and tremor, or imaging hardware related problems, such as table vibrations, etc. These artefacts can severely degrade the resulting images and render diffusion analysis difficult or impossible. In order to overcome these problems, we developed a robust and efficient framework enabling the use of initially corrupted images from a clinical study. At the heart of this framework is an improved least trimmed squares diffusion tensor estimation algorithm that works well with severely degraded datasets with low signal-to-noise ratio. This approach has been compared with other diffusion imaging post-processing algorithms using simulations and in vivo experiments. Exploiting track-based spatial statistics analysis, we demonstrate that corrupted datasets can be restored and reused in further clinical studies rather than being discarded due to poor quality. The developed robust framework is shown to exhibit a high efficiency and accuracy and can, in principle, be exploited in other MR studies where artefact/outlier suppression is needed.",0
"We develop a relativistic covariant and unitary description of the pion-nucleon interaction in a hadron-exchange model. The model is based on the solution of a dimensionally reduced (quasipotential) Bethe-Salpeter equation for the partial-wave off-shell $\pi N$ scattering amplitudes with the potential consisting of the field-theoretical $s$- and $u$-channel nucleon, Roper, Delta, $D_{13}$, $S_{11}$ exchanges, and the $t$-channel $\rho$ and $\sigma$ meson exchanges. The contributions of the spin-3/2 Delta and $D_{13}$ resonances are treated within the Rarita-Schwinger formalism and different forms of the $\pi N\Delta$ vertex are investigated. The free parameters of the model are fitted to the $\pi N$ phase-shift data of the KH80 and SM95 partial-wave analyses in the region up to 600 MeV pion kinetic energy. The resulting on-shell solution provides a good description of the $\pi N$ scattering lengths, as well as the energy behavior of the S, P, and D partial waves. The sensitivity of the phase shifts on various model-dependent effects is examined.",0
"We consider the problem of adaptive estimation of the regression function in a framework where we replace ergodicity assumptions (such as independence or mixing) by another structural assumption on the model. Namely, we propose adaptive upper bounds for kernel estimators with data-driven bandwidth (Lepski's selection rule) in a regression model where the noise is an increment of martingale. It includes, as very particular cases, the usual i.i.d. regression and auto-regressive models. The cornerstone tool for this study is a new result for self-normalized martingales, called ``stability'', which is of independent interest. In a first part, we only use the martingale increment structure of the noise. We give an adaptive upper bound using a random rate, that involves the occupation time near the estimation point. Thanks to this approach, the theoretical study of the statistical procedure is disconnected from usual ergodicity properties like mixing. Then, in a second part, we make a link with the usual minimax theory of deterministic rates. Under a beta-mixing assumption on the covariates process, we prove that the random rate considered in the first part is equivalent, with large probability, to a deterministic rate which is the usual minimax adaptive one.",0
"This is a whitepaper submitted to the 2010 Astronomy Decadal Review process, addressing the potential tests of gravity theory that could be made by observations of gravitational waves in the milliHertz frequency band by the proposed ESA-NASA gravitational wave observatory LISA. A key issue is that observations in this band of binary systems consisting of black holes offer very clean tests with high signal-to-noise ratios. Gravitational waves would probe nonlinear gravity and could reveal small corrections, such as extra long-range fields that arise in unified theories, deviations of the metric around massive black holes from the Kerr solution, massive gravitons, chiral effects, and effects of extra dimensions. The availability of strong signals from massive black hole binaries as well as complex signals from extreme mass-ratio binaries is unique to the milliHertz waveband and makes LISA a particularly sensitive probe of the validity of general relativity.",0
"We consider the inhomogeneous generalization of the density matrix of a finite segment of length $m$ of the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain. It is a function of the temperature $T$ and the external magnetic field $h$, and further depends on $m$ `spectral parameters' $\xi_j$. For short segments of length 2 and 3 we decompose the known multiple integrals for the elements of the density matrix into finite sums over products of single integrals. This provides new numerically efficient expressions for the two-point functions of the infinite Heisenberg chain at short distances. It further leads us to conjecture an exponential formula for the density matrix involving only a double Cauchy-type integral in the exponent. We expect this formula to hold for arbitrary $m$ and $T$ but zero magnetic field.",0
"Explicit high-order non-canonical symplectic particle-in-cell algorithms for classical particle-field systems governed by the Vlasov-Maxwell equations are developed. The algorithm conserves a discrete non-canonical symplectic structure derived from the Lagrangian of the particle-field system, which is naturally discrete in particles. The electromagnetic field is spatially-discretized using the method of discrete exterior calculus with high-order interpolating differential forms for a cubic grid. The resulting time-domain Lagrangian assumes a non-canonical symplectic structure. It is also gauge invariant and conserves charge. The system is then solved using a splitting method discovered by He et al., which produces five exactly-soluable sub-systems, and high-order structure- preserving algorithms follow by combinations. The explicit, high-order, and conservative nature of the algorithms is especially suitable for long-term simulations of particle-field systems with extremely large number of degrees of freedom on massively parallel supercomputers. The algorithms have been tested and verified by the two physics problems, i.e., the nonlinear Landau damping and the electron Bernstein wave.",0
In the presented paper we have estimated additional to the standard model (SM) contributions to the top quark FCNC decays in the framework of the model with one extra dimension. The estimates of performed calculations show that extra dimension models with only one additional spatial dimension cannot raise branching ratio for top FCNC decay.,0
"We present an efficient subpixel refinement method usinga learning-based approach called Linear Predictors. Two key ideas are shown in this paper. Firstly, we present a novel technique, called Symbolic Linear Predictors, which makes the learning step efficient for subpixel refinement. This makes our approach feasible for online applications without compromising accuracy, while taking advantage of the run-time efficiency of learning based approaches. Secondly, we show how Linear Predictors can be used to predict the expected alignment error, allowing us to use only the best keypoints in resource constrained applications. We show the efficiency and accuracy of our method through extensive experiments.",0
"The functions of the gluon fragmentation into $^3P_J$ quarkonium are calculated to order $\alpha_s^2$. With the recent progress in analysing quarkonium systems in QCD we show explicitly how the socalled divergence in the limit of the zero-binding energy, which is related to $P$-wave quarkonia, is treated correctly in the case of fragmentation functions. The obtained fragmentation functions satisfy explicitly at the order of $\alpha_s^2$ the Altarelli-Parisi equation and when $z\rightarrow 0$ they behave as $z^{-1}$ as expected. Some comments on the previous results are made.",0
"For an absolutely continuous (integer-valued) r.v. $X$ of the Pearson (Ord) family, we show that, under natural moment conditions, a Stein-type covariance identity of order $k$ holds (cf. [Goldstein and Reinert, J. Theoret. Probab. 18 (2005) 237--260]). This identity is closely related to the corresponding sequence of orthogonal polynomials, obtained by a Rodrigues-type formula, and provides convenient expressions for the Fourier coefficients of an arbitrary function. Application of the covariance identity yields some novel expressions for the corresponding lower variance bounds for a function of the r.v. $X$, expressions that seem to be known only in particular cases (for the Normal, see [Houdr\'{e} and Kagan, J. Theoret. Probab. 8 (1995) 23--30]; see also [Houdr\'{e} and P\'{e}rez-Abreu, Ann. Probab. 23 (1995) 400--419] for corresponding results related to the Wiener and Poisson processes). Some applications are also given.",0
"We present a new proof of results of Kurdyka & Paunescu, and of Rainer, about real-analytic multi-parameters generalizations of classical results by Rellich and Kato about the reduction in families of univariate deformations of normal operators over real or complex vector spaces of finite dimensions. Given a real analytic family of normal operators over a finite dimensional real or complex vector space, there exists a locally finite composition of blowings-up with smooth centers re-parameterizing the given family such that at each point of the source space of the re-parameterizing mapping, there exists a neighbourhood of any given point over which exists a real analytic orthonormal frame in which the pull back of the operator is in reduced form at every point of the neighbourhood. A free by-product of our proof is the local real analyticity of the eigen-values, which in all prior works was a prerequisite step to get local regular reducing bases.",0
"Mixed valence rare-earth samarium compounds SmX (X=Se,Te) have been recently proposed as candidate materials for use in high-speed, low-power digital switches driven by stress induced changes of resistivity. At room temperature these materials exhibit a pressure driven insulator-to-metal transition with resistivity decreasing by up to 7 orders of magnitude over a small pressure range. Thus, the application of only a few GPa's to the piezoresistor (SmX) allows the switching device to perform complex logic. Here we study from first principles the electronic properties of these compounds under uniaxial strain and discuss the consequences on carrier transport. The changes in the band structure show that the piezoresistive response is mostly governed by the reduction of band gap with strain. Furthermore, it becomes optimal when the Fermi level is pinned near the localized valence band. The piezoresistive effect under uniaxial strain which must be taken into account in thin films and other systems with reduced dimensionality is also quantified. Under uniaxial strain we find that the piezoresistive response can be substantially larger than in the isotropic case. Analysis of complex band structure of SmSe yields a tunneling length of the order of 1 nm. The results suggest that the conduction mechanism governing the piezoresistive effect in bulk, i.e.~thermal promotion of electrons, should still be dominant in few-nanometer-thick films.",0
"We discuss a closure of commutator algebras for general functionals in terms of Nambu-Goldstone fermions and their derivative terms under nonlinear supersymmetry (NLSUSY) both in flat spacetime and in curved spacetime. We point out that variations of functionals for vector supermultiplets (uniquely) determine general LSUSY transformations for linear vector supermutiplets with general auxiliary fields in extended SUSY, where the closure of the commutator algebras for NLSUSY plays a crucial role.",0
"Defect-based quantum systems in in wide bandgap semiconductors are strong candidates for scalable quantum-information technologies. However, these systems are often complicated by charge-state instabilities and interference by phonons, which can diminish spin-initialization fidelities and limit room-temperature operation. Here, we identify a pathway around these drawbacks by showing that an engineered quantum well can stabilize the charge state of a qubit. Using density-functional theory and experimental synchrotron x-ray diffraction studies, we construct a model for previously unattributed point defect centers in silicon carbide (SiC) as a near-stacking fault axial divacancy and show how this model explains these defect's robustness against photoionization and room temperature stability. These results provide a materials-based solution to the optical instability of color centers in semiconductors, paving the way for the development of robust single-photon sources and spin qubits.",0
"We present new HST/WFC3 imaging data of RCSGA 032727-132609, a bright lensed galaxy at z=1.7 that is magnified and stretched by the lensing cluster RCS2 032727-132623. Using this new high-resolution imaging, we modify our previous lens model (which was based on ground-based data) to fully understand the lensing geometry, and use it to reconstruct the lensed galaxy in the source plane. This giant arc represents a unique opportunity to peer into 100-pc scale structures in a high-redshift galaxy. This new source reconstruction will be crucial for a future analysis of the spatially-resolved rest-UV and rest-optical spectra of the brightest parts of the arc.",0
"A structured collection of thought provoking conclusions about space and time is given. Using only the Compton wavelength lambda = hbar / m c and the Schwarzschild radius r_s = 2 G m / c^2, it is argued that neither the continuity of space-time nor the concepts of space-point, instant, or point particle have experimental backing at high energies. It is then deduced that Lorentz, gauge, and discrete symmetries are not precisely fulfilled in nature. In the same way, using a simple and new Gedankenexperiment, it is found that at Planck energies, vacuum is fundamentally indistinguishable from radiation and from matter. Some consequences for supersymmetry, duality, and unification are presented.",0
A broadband squeezed vacuum photon field is characterized by a complex squeezing function. We show that by controlling the wavelength dependence of its phase it is possible to change the dynamics of the atomic polarization interacting with the squeezed vacuum. Such a phase modulation effectively produces a finite range temporal interaction kernel between the two quadratures of the atomic polarization yielding the change in the decay rates as well as the appearance of additional oscillation frequencies. We show that decay rates slower than the spontaneous decay rate can be achieved even for a squeezed bath in the classic regime. For linear and quadratic phase modulations the power spectrum of the scattered light exhibits narrowing of the central peak due to the modified decay rates. For strong phase modulations side lobes appear symmetrically around the central peak reflecting additional oscillation frequencies.,0
"We present the results of the magnetization and dielectric constant measurements on untwinned single crystal samples of the frustrated S=1/2 chain cuprate LiCu_2O_2. Novel magnetic phase transitions were observed. A spin flop transition of the spiral spin plane was observed for the field orientations H||a,b. The second magnetic transition was observed at H~15 T for all three principal field directions. This high field magnetic phase is discussed as a collinear spin-modulated phase which is expected for an S=1/2 nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic and next-nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic chain system.",0
"Node similarity is a fundamental problem in graph analytics. However, node similarity between nodes in different graphs (inter-graph nodes) has not received a lot of attention yet. The inter-graph node similarity is important in learning a new graph based on the knowledge of an existing graph (transfer learning on graphs) and has applications in biological, communication, and social networks. In this paper, we propose a novel distance function for measuring inter-graph node similarity with edit distance, called NED. In NED, two nodes are compared according to their local neighborhood structures which are represented as unordered k-adjacent trees, without relying on labels or other assumptions. Since the computation problem of tree edit distance on unordered trees is NP-Complete, we propose a modified tree edit distance, called TED*, for comparing neighborhood trees. TED* is a metric distance, as the original tree edit distance, but more importantly, TED* is polynomially computable. As a metric distance, NED admits efficient indexing, provides interpretable results, and shows to perform better than existing approaches on a number of data analysis tasks, including graph de-anonymization. Finally, the efficiency and effectiveness of NED are empirically demonstrated using real-world graphs.",0
"We find the asymptotics of the counting function of zeroes of random entire functions represented by Rademacher Taylor series. We also give the asymptotics of the weighted counting function, which takes into account the arguments of zeroes. These results answer several questions left open after the pioneering work of Littlewood and Offord of 1948. The proofs are based on our recent result on the logarithmic integrability of Rademacher Fourier series.",0
"In this work we present a way to construct the so-called root diagram for one-point AG codes $C$ arising from certain types of curves $\mathcal{X}$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$ with plane model $f(y)=g(x)$.

We study a mechanical resonator made of aluminum near the normal to super conductivity phase transition. A sharp drop in the rate of mechanical damping is observed below the critical temperature. The experimental results are compared with predictions based on the Bardeen Cooper Schrieffer theory of superconductivity and a fair agreement is obtained.,0
"In this paper we investigate the diffusion of particles inside a chain of asymmetric cavities. We are considering particles that interact through a hard--core potential and are driven by an external force. We show that the difference in the current when the force is applied to the left and to the right strongly depends on the concentration inside the cavity. We found that, when the concentration is high enough, the hard--core interaction vanishes and inverts the asymmetric effect of the cavity. We also introduce a new equation, a modification to the Fick--Jacobs equation, to describe this system analytically. Finally, we used numerical simulations to verify the analytic results, finding a good agreement between theory and simulations.",0
"Establishing the strong converse theorem for a communication channel confirms that the capacity of that channel, that is, the maximum achievable rate of reliable information communication, is the ultimate limit of communication over that channel. Indeed, the strong converse theorem for a channel states that coding at a rate above the capacity of the channel results in the convergence of the error to its maximum value 1 and that there is no trade-off between communication rate and decoding error. Here we prove that the strong converse theorem holds for the product-state capacity of quantum channels with ergodic Markovian correlated memory.",0
"In this paper we study properties of numbers $K_n^l$ of connected components of bifurcation diagrams for multiboundary singularities $B_n^l$. These numbers generalize classic Bernoulli-Euler numbers. We prove a recurrent relation on the numbers $K_n^l$. As it was known before, $K^1_n$ is $(n{+}1)$-th Bernoulli-Euler number, this gives us a necessary boundary condition to calculate $K_n^l$. We also find the generating functions for $K_n^l$ with small fixed $l$ and write partial differential equations for the general case. The recurrent relations lead to numerous relations between Bernoulli-Euler numbers. We show them in the last section of the paper.",0
We consider a transmission problem on a polygonal partition for the two-dimensional conductivity equation. For suitable classes of partitions we establish the exact behaviour of the gradient of solutions in a neighbourhood of the vertexes of the partition. This allows to prove shape differentiability of solutions and to establish an explicit formula for the shape derivative.,0
"On the basis of the target mass corrections to structure functions of deep-inelastic scattering of leptons, we evaluate effective nucleon mass that turns out to be twice $M_{nucl.}$ for deep-inelastic scattering on the nucleus target and equals $M_{nucl.}$ for the hydrogen target.",0
"Third order nonlinear evolution equations, that is the Korteweg-deVries (KdV), modified Korteweg-deVries (mKdV) equation and other ones are considered: they all are connected via Baecklund transformations. These links can be depicted in a wide Baecklund Chart} which further extends the previous one constructed in [22]. In particular, the Baecklund transformation which links the mKdV equation to the KdV singularity manifold equation is reconsidered and the nonlinear equation for the KdV eigenfunction is shown to be linked to all the equations in the previously constructed Baecklund Chart. That is, such a Baecklund Chart is expanded to encompass the nonlinear equation for the KdV eigenfunctions [30], which finds its origin in the early days of the study of Inverse scattering Transform method, when the Lax pair for the KdV equation was constructed. The nonlinear equation for the KdV eigenfunctions is proved to enjoy a nontrivial invariance property. Furthermore, the hereditary recursion operator it admits [30 is recovered via a different method. Then, the results are extended to the whole hierarchy of nonlinear evolution equations it generates. Notably, the established links allow to show that also the nonlinear equation for the KdV eigenfunction is connected to the Dym equation since both such equations appear in the same Baecklund chart.",0
General purpose computing on graphic processing units (GPU) is a potential method of speeding up scientific computation with low cost and high energy efficiency. We experimented with the particle physics simulation toolkit Geant4 used at CERN to benchmark its geometry navigation functionality on a GPU. The goal was to find out whether Geant4 physics simulations could benefit from GPU acceleration and how difficult it is to modify Geant4 code to run in a GPU. We ported selected parts of Geant4 code to C99 & CUDA and implemented a simple gamma physics simulation utilizing this code to measure efficiency. The performance of the program was tested by running it on two different platforms: NVIDIA GeForce 470 GTX GPU and a 12-core AMD CPU system. Our conclusion was that GPUs can be a competitive alternate for multi-core computers but porting existing software in an efficient way is challenging.,0
"Recently, we proposed a capacity expansion approach for transmission grids that combines the upgrade of transmission capacity with a transition in system structure to improve grid operation. The key to this concept is a particular hybrid AC/DC transmission grid architecture, which is obtained by uprating selected AC lines via a conversion to HVDC. We have shown that this system structure improves optimal power flow (OPF) solvability and that it can reduce the total generation costs. In this work, we study the benefits of this hybrid architecture in the context of a deregulated electricity market. We propose an efficient and accurate nodal pricing method based on locational marginal prices (LMPs) that utilizes a second-order cone relaxation of the OPF problem. Applicability of this method requires exactness of the relaxation, which is difficult to obtain for conventional meshed AC transmission grids. We prove that the hybrid architecture ensures applicability if the LMPs do not coincide with certain pathological price profiles, which are shown to be unlikely under normal operating conditions. Using this nodal pricing method, we demonstrate that upgrading to the hybrid architecture can not only increase the effective transmission capacity but also reduce the separation of nodal markets and improve the utilization of generation.",0

"We present an observational and theoretical study of the ionization fraction in several massive cores located in regions that are currently forming stellar clusters. Maps of the emission from the J = 1-> O transitions of C18O, DCO+, N2H+, and H13CO+, as well as the J = 2 -> 1 and J = 3 -> 2 transitions of CS, were obtained for each core. Core densities are determined via a large velocity gradient analysis with values typically 10^5 cm^-3. With the use of observations to constrain variables in the chemical calculations we derive electron fractions for our overall sample of 5 cores directly associated with star formation and 2 apparently starless cores. The electron abundances are found to lie within a small range, -6.9 < log10(x_e) < -7.3, and are consistent with previous work. We find no difference in the amount of ionization fraction between cores with and without associated star formation activity, nor is any difference found in electron abundances between the edge and center of the emission region. Thus our models are in agreement with the standard picture of cosmic rays as the primary source of ionization for molecular ions. With the addition of previously determined electron abundances for low mass cores, and even more massive cores associated with O and B clusters, we systematically examine the ionization fraction as a function of star formation activity. This analysis demonstrates that the most massive sources stand out as having the lowest electron abundances (x_e < 10^-8).",0
"The Energetic X-ray Imaging Survey Telescope (EXIST) is a proposed next generation multi-wavelength survey mission. The primary instrument is a High Energy telescope (HET) that conducts the deepest survey for Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs), obscured-accreting and dormant Supermassive Black Holes and Transients of all varieties for immediate followup studies by the two secondary instruments: a Soft X-ray Imager (SXI) and an Optical/Infrared Telescope (IRT). EXIST will explore the early Universe using high redshift GRBs as cosmic probes and survey black holes on all scales. The HET is a coded aperture telescope employing a large array of imaging CZT detectors (4.5 m^2, 0.6 mm pixel) and a hybrid Tungsten mask. We review the current HET concept which follows an intensive design revision by the HET imaging working group and the recent engineering studies in the Instrument and Mission Design Lab at the Goddard Space Flight Center. The HET will locate GRBs and transients quickly (<10-30 sec) and accurately (< 20"""") for rapid (< 1-3 min) onboard followup soft X-ray and optical/IR (0.3-2.2 micron) imaging and spectroscopy. The broad energy band (5-600 keV) and the wide field of view (~90 deg x 70 deg at 10% coding fraction) are optimal for capturing GRBs, obscured AGNs and rare transients. The continuous scan of the entire sky every 3 hours will establish a finely-sampled long-term history of many X-ray sources, opening up new possibilities for variability studies.",0
"By exploiting photo-induced reorientation in azo-polymer thin films, we demonstrate all-optical polarization-encoded information storage with a scanning near-field optical microscope. In the writing routine, 5-level bits are created by associating different bit values to different birefringence directions, induced in the polymer after illumination with linearly polarized light. The reading routine is then performed by implementing polarization-modulation techniques on the same near-field microscope, in order to measure the encoded birefringence direction.",0
"We consider the problem of stable matching with dynamic preference lists. At each time step, the preference list of some player may change by swapping random adjacent members. The goal of a central agency (algorithm) is to maintain an approximately stable matching (in terms of number of blocking pairs) at all times. The changes in the preference lists are not reported to the algorithm, but must instead be probed explicitly by the algorithm. We design an algorithm that in expectation and with high probability maintains a matching that has at most $O((log (n))^2)$ blocking pairs.",0
"Atomic bosons and fermions in an optical lattice can realize a variety of interesting condensed matter states that support equilibrium current patterns in the presence of synthetic magnetic fields or non-abelian gauge fields. As a route to probing such mass currents, we propose a nonequilibrium quantum quench of the Hamiltonian that dynamically converts the current patterns into experimentally measurable real-space density patterns. We illustrate how a specific such """"unidirectional"""" quench of the optical lattice can be used to uncover checkerboard and stripe current orders in lattice Bose superfluids and Fermi gases, as well as chiral edge currents in an integer quantum Hall state.",0
"In this paper, we propose a method, that is based on equivariant moving frames, for development of high order accurate invariant compact finite difference schemes that preserve Lie symmetries of underlying partial differential equations. In this method, variable transformations that are obtained from the extended symmetry groups of PDEs are used to transform independent and dependent variables, and derivative terms of compact finite difference schemes (constructed for these PDEs) such that the resulting schemes are invariant under the chosen symmetry groups. The unknown symmetry parameters that arise from the application of these transformations are determined through selection of convenient moving frames. In some cases, owing to selection of convenient moving frames, numerical representation of invariant (or symmetry preserving) compact numerical schemes, that are developed through the proposed method, are found to be notably simpler than that of standard, noninvariant compact numerical schemes. Further, the order of accuracy of these invariant compact schemes can be arbitrarily set to a desired order by considering suitable compact finite difference algorithms. Application of the proposed method is demonstrated through construction of invariant compact finite difference schemes for some common linear and nonlinear PDEs (including the linear advection-diffusion equation in 1D/2D, the inviscid and viscous Burgers' equations in 1D). Results obtained from our numerical simulations indicate that invariant compact finite difference schemes not only inherit selected symmetry properties of underlying PDEs, but are also comparably more accurate than the standard, non-invariant base numerical schemes considered here.",0
"Density operators are one of the key ingredients of quantum theory. They can be constructed in two ways: via a convex sum of `doubled kets' (i.e. mixing), and by tracing out part of a `doubled' two-system ket (i.e. dilation). Both constructions can be iterated, yielding new mathematical species that have already found applications outside physics. However, as we show in this paper, the iterated constructions no longer yield the same mathematical species. Hence, the constructions `mixing' and `dilation' themselves are by no means equivalent. Concretely, when applying the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism to the second iteration, dilation produces arbitrary symmetric bipartite states, while mixing only yields the disentangled ones. All results are proven using diagrams, and hence they hold not only for quantum theory, but also for a much more general class of process theories.",0
"Electroluminescence produced during avalanche development in gaseous avalanche detectors is an useful information for triggering, calorimetry and tracking in gaseous detectors. Noble gases present high electroluminescence yields, emitting mainly in the VUV region. The photons can provide signal readout if appropriate photosensors are used. Micropattern gaseous detectors are good candidates for signal amplification in high background and/or low rate experiments due to their high electroluminescence yields and radiopurity. In this work, the VUV light responses of the Gas Electron Multiplier and of the Micro-Hole Strip Plate, working with pure xenon, are simulated and studied in detail using a new and versatile C++ toolkit. It is shown that the solid angle subtended by a photosensor placed below the microstructures depends on the operating conditions. The obtained absolute EL yields, determined for different gas pressures and as functions of the applied voltage, are compared with those determined experimentally.",0
"X-ray scattering is a weak linear probe of matter. It is primarily sensitive to the position of electrons and their momentum distribution. Elastic X-ray scattering forms the basis of atomic structural determination while inelastic Compton scattering is often used as a spectroscopic probe of both single-particle excitations and collective modes. X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) are unique tools for studying matter on its natural time and length scales due to their bright and coherent ultrashort pulses. However, in the focus of an XFEL the assumption of a weak linear probe breaks down, and nonlinear light-matter interactions can become ubiquitous. The field can be sufficiently high that even non-resonant multiphoton interactions at hard X-rays wavelengths become relevant. Here we report the observation of one of the most fundamental nonlinear X-ray-matter interactions, the simultaneous Compton scattering of two identical photons producing a single photon at nearly twice the photon energy. We measure scattered photons with an energy near 18 keV generated from solid beryllium irradiated by 8.8-9.75 keV XFEL pulses. The intensity in the X-ray focus reaches up to 4x20 W/cm2, which corresponds to a peak electric field two orders of magnitude higher than the atomic unit of field-strength and within four orders of magnitude of the quantum electrodynamic critical field. The observed signal scales quadratically in intensity and is emitted into a non-dipolar pattern, consistent with the simultaneous two-photon scattering from free electrons. However, the energy of the generated photons shows an anomalously large redshift only present at high intensities. This indicates that the instantaneous high-intensity scattering effectively interacts with a different electron momentum distribution than linear Compton scattering, with implications for the study of atomic-scale structure and dynamics of matter",0
"The isovector bottomoniumlike exotic resonances $Z_b(10610)$ and $Z_b(10650)$ are very close to the thresholds of heavy meson pairs $B \bar B^* \, ( \bar B B^*)$ and $B^* \bar B^*$, and are naturally understood as `molecular' states made of the corresponding meson-antimeson pairs. The picture with a full separation of the two channels cannot be exact and a cross-feed between the states necessarily takes place. A simple model is considered here describing the mixing between the channels in terms of one parameter. The model reasonably describes the current data on the decays of the $Z_b$ resonances to bottomonium plus a pion and predicts the rate and a distinctive interference pattern for the decay $Z_b(10650) \to B \bar B^* \, ( \bar B B^*)$ as well as excess of the mass splitting between the resonances over the mass difference between $B^*$ and $B$ mesons.",0
"The physics underlying quark and lepton masses and mixings (the """"flavor problem"""") is the least well understood aspect of the Standard Model. Some questions of flavor physics, and ways in which the LHC can help shed light on this problem, are described.",0
"We investigate the constraints on Supersymmetry arising from available precision measurements using a global fit approach. When interpreted within minimal supergravity (mSUGRA), the data provide significant constraints on the masses of supersymmetric particles, which are predicted to be light enough for an early discovery at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We provide predicted mass spectra including, for the first time, full uncertainty bands. The most stringent constraint is from the measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. Using the results of these fits, we investigate to which precision mSUGRA and more general MSSM parameters can be measured by the LHC experiments with three different integrated luminosities for a parameter point which approximately lies in the region preferred by current data. The impact of the already available measurements on these precisions, when combined with LHC data, is also studied. We develop a method to treat ambiguities arising from different interpretations of the data within one model and provide a way to differentiate between values of different digital parameters of a model. Finally, we show how measurements at a linear collider with up to 1 TeV centre-of-mass energy will help to improve precision by an order of magnitude.",0
"We study the Heisenberg spin chain with twisted boundary conditions, focusing on the adiabatic flow of the energy spectrum as a function of the twist angle. In terms of effective field theory for the nearest-neighbor model, we show that the period 2 (in unit $2\pi$) obtained by Sutherland and Shastry arises from irrelevant perturbations around the massless fixed point, and that this period may be rather general for one-dimensional interacting lattice models at half filling. In contrast, the period for the Haldane-Shastry spin model with $1/r^2$ interaction has a different and unique origin for the period, namely, it reflects fractional statistics in Haldane's sense.",0
"Using the recently proposed approximation for multiskyrmion fields based on rational maps we study the masses and baryonic radii of some strange multibaryons within the bound state soliton model. We find the tetralambda binding to be stronger than previously expected. In addition, the model predicts the existence of a ``heptalambda'' which is stable against strong decays.",0
"We report on X-ray observations of the supernova remnant 0509-67.5 in the Large Magellanic Cloud with XMM-Newton X-ray observatory. We use the imaging spectroscopy (EPIC) and Reflective Grating Spectrometer (RGS) data to investigate properties of the remnant and its environment. The X-ray spectra were analyzed with SPEX software package. In addition to this we performed a numerical hydrodynamic simulation of the remnant. The EPIC data show prominent Fe K line emission, but the deduced overall amount of iron in the shocked ejecta is low. The data also show that the remnant has an asymmetric ejecta structure: the bright southwest region of the remnant shows an overabundance of metals. The analysis of the RGS spectrum shows that the remnant has a high lines velocity broadening of ~5000 km/s. We found a hydrodynamical model for the remnant with basic hydrodynamical and spectral parameters similar to the observed ones. The data analysis show that the reverse shock just recently reached iron layers of the ejecta. The brightness enhancement in the southwest region could be a sign of an asymmetric explosion or it could be the result of a density enhancement of the interstellar medium. We constructed numerical models which are in good agreement with the observations, with circumstellar density of 3e-25 g/cm^3, age of ~400 years, velocities of ~5000 km/s and an electron to ion temperature ratio of 0.01.",0
"In a previous article we had proved an algebraicity result for the central critical value for L-functions for GL(n) x GL(n-1) over Q assuming the validity of a nonvanishing hypothesis involving archimedean integrals. The purpose of this article is to generalize that result for all critical values for L-functions for GL(n) x GL(n-1) over any number field F. Binyong Sun has recently proved that nonvanishing hypothesis and so the results of this article are unconditional. Using such results for the case of GL(3) x GL(2), new unconditional algebraicity results for the special values of symmetric cube L-functions for GL(2) over F have been proved.",0
"Quantum Hall systems are recently shown to possess a quantity sensitive to the spatial geometry and topology of the system, dubbed the Hall viscosity $\eta_H$. Despite the extensive theoretical discussions on its properties, the question of how to measure $\eta_H$ still poses a challenge. In this paper, we present a general relation between Hall viscosity and susceptibility for systems with Galilean invariance. Thus, it allows for determination of $\eta_H$ through density response signatures. The relations are verified in the integer quantum Hall example, and is further illustrated in an effective hydrodynamic analysis. Since the derivation is based on Kubo formulae and assumes no more than conservation laws and translational symmetry, the results are applicable to a wide range of systems.",0
"Associated to a IFS one can consider a continuous map $\hat{\sigma} : [0,1]\times \Sigma \to [0,1]\times \Sigma$, defined by $\hat{\sigma}(x,w)=(\tau_{X_{1}(w)}(x), \sigma(w))$ were $\Sigma=\{0,1, ..., d-1\}^{\mathbb{N}}$, $\sigma: \Sigma \to \Sigma$ is given by$\sigma(w_{1},w_{2},w_{3},...)=(w_{2},w_{3},w_{4}...)$ and $X_{k} : \Sigma \to \{0,1, ..., n-1\}$ is the projection on the coordinate $k$. A $\rho$-weighted system, $\rho \geq 0$, is a weighted system $([0,1], \tau_{i}, u_{i})$ such that there exists a positive bounded function $h : [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ and probability $\nu $ on $[0,1]$ satisfying $ P_{u}(h)=\rho h, \quad P_{u}^{*}(\nu)=\rho\nu$. A probability $\hat{\nu}$ on $[0,1]\times \Sigma$ is called holonomic for $\hat{\sigma}$ if $ \int g \circ \hat{\sigma} d\hat{\nu}= \int g d\hat{\nu}, \forall g \in C([0,1])$. We denote the set of holonomic probabilities by ${\cal H}$. Via disintegration, holonomic probabilities $\hat{\nu}$ on $[0,1]\times \Sigma$ are naturally associated to a $\rho$-weighted system. More precisely, there exist a probability $\nu$ on $[0,1]$ and $u_i, i\in\{0, 1,2,..,d-1\}$ on $[0,1]$, such that is $P_{u}^*(\nu)=\nu$. We consider holonomic ergodic probabilities. For a holonomic probability we define entropy. Finally, we analyze the problem: given $\phi \in \mathbb{B}^{+}$, find the solution of the maximization pressure problem $$p(\phi)=$$",0
"A study is presented of the mass and spin-parity of the new boson recently observed at the LHC at a mass near 125 GeV. An integrated luminosity of 17.3 inverse femtobarns, collected by the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV, is used. The measured mass in the ZZ channel, where both Z bosons decay to e or mu pairs, is 126.2 +/- 0.6 (stat.) +/- 0.2 (syst.) GeV. The angular distributions of the lepton pairs in this channel are sensitive to the spin-parity of the boson. Under the assumption of spin 0, the present data are consistent with the pure scalar hypothesis, while disfavoring the pure pseudoscalar hypothesis.",0
"We introduce a one-dimensional model which interpolates between the Ising model and the quantum compass model with frustrated pseudospin interactions $\sigma_i^z\sigma_{i+1}^z$ and $\sigma_i^x\sigma_{i+1}^x$, alternating between even/odd bonds, and present its exact solution by mapping to quantum Ising models. We show that the nearest neighbor pseudospin correlations change discontinuosly and indicate divergent correlation length at the first order quantum phase transition. At this transition one finds the disordered ground state of the compass model with high degeneracy $2\times 2^{N/2}$ in the limit of $N\to\infty$.",0
We compute the dimensionality dependence of $\eta/s$ for charged black branes with Gauss-Bonnet correction. We find that both causality and stability constrain the value of Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant to be bounded by 1/4 in the infinite dimensionality limit. We further show that higher dimensionality stabilize the gravitational perturbation. The stabilization of the perturbation in higher dimensional space-time is a straightforward consequence of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant bound.,0
"We report on the observations of cosmic rays with energies > 1.0 EeV from Jan 2004 to April 2009 by the Pierre Auger Observatory. During this period the Observatory has grown from about 300 surface detectors to about 1600 upon its completion in November 2008. The 1600 surface detectors are overlooked by 24 fluorescence telescopes. We report on measurements of the cosmic ray spectrum, the arrival directions and the elongation rate. We also report limits for the photon and neutrino components of this cosmic radiation.",0
We use the effective-mass approximation and the density-functional theory with the local-density approximation for modeling two-dimensional nano-structures connected phase-coherently to two infinite leads. Using the non-equilibrium Green's function method the electron density and the current are calculated under a bias voltage. The problem of solving for the Green's functions numerically is formulated using the finite-element method (FEM). The Green's functions have non-reflecting open boundary conditions to take care of the infinite size of the system. We show how these boundary conditions are formulated in the FEM. The scheme is tested by calculating transmission probabilities for simple model potentials. The potential of the scheme is demonstrated by determining non-linear current-voltage behaviors of resonant tunneling structures.,0
"We investigate the region around the Planck-detected z=3.26 gravitationally lensed galaxy HATLAS J114637.9-001132 (hereinafter HATLAS12-00) using both archival Herschel data from the H-ATLAS survey and using submm data obtained with both LABOCA and SCUBA2. The lensed source is found to be surrounded by a strong overdensity of both Herschel-SPIRE sources and submm sources. We detect 17 bright (S_870 >~7 mJy) sources at >4sigma closer than 5 arcmin to the lensed object at 850/870 microns. Ten of these sources have good cross-identifications with objects detected by Herschel-SPIRE which have redder colours than other sources in the field, with 350 micron flux > 250 micron flux, suggesting that they lie at high redshift. Submillimeter Array (SMA) observations localise one of these companions to ~1 arcsecond, allowing unambiguous cross identification with a 3.6 and 4.5 micron Spitzer source. The optical/near-IR spectral energy distribution (SED) of this source is measured by further observations and found to be consistent with z>2, but incompatible with lower redshifts. We conclude that this system may be a galaxy cluster/protocluster or larger scale structure that contains a number of galaxies undergoing starbursts at the same time.",0
"On-shell Pauli-Villars regularization of the one-loop divergences of supergravity theories is used to study the anomaly structure of supergravity and the cancellation of field theory anomalies under a $U(1)$ gauge transformation and under the T-duality group of modular transformations in effective supergravity theories with three K\""""ahler moduli $T^i$ obtained from orbifold compactification of the weakly coupled heterotic string. This procedure requires constraints on the chiral matter representations of the gauge group that are consistent with known results from orbifold compactifications. Pauli-Villars regulator fields allow for the cancellation of all quadratic and logarithmic divergences, as well as most linear divergences. If all linear divergences were canceled, the theory would be anomaly free, with noninvariance of the action arising only from Pauli-Villars masses. However there are linear divergences associated with nonrenormalizable gravitino/gaugino interactions that cannot be canceled by PV fields. The resulting chiral anomaly forms a supermultiplet with the corresponding conformal anomaly, provided the ultraviolet cut-off has the appropriate field dependence, in which case total derivative terms, such as Gauss-Bonnet, do not drop out from the effective action. The anomalies can be partially canceled by the four-dimensional version of the Green-Schwarz mechanism, but additional counterterms, and/or a more elaborate set of Pauli-Villars fields and couplings, are needed to cancel the full anomaly, including D-term contributions to the conformal anomaly that are nonlinear in the parameters of the anomalous transformations.",0
"We derive and discuss the constraints induced by Poincare' invariance on the form of the heavy-quark potential up to order 1/m^2. We present two derivations: one uses general arguments directly based on the Poincare' algebra and the other follows from an explicit calculation on the expression of the potential in terms of Wilson loops. We confirm relations from the literature, but also clarify the origin of a long-standing false statement pointed out recently.",0
"It is speculated that some weakly active comets may be transitional objects between active and dormant comets. These objects are at a unique stage of the evolution of cometary nuclei, as they are still identifiable as active comets, in contrast to inactive comets that are observationally indistinguishable from low albedo asteroids. In this paper, we present a synthesis of comet and meteor observations of Jupiter-family comet 209P/LINEAR, one of the most weakly active comets recorded to-date. Images taken by the Xingming 0.35-m telescope and the Gemini Flamingo-2 camera are modeled by a Monte Carlo dust model, which yields a low dust ejection speed ($1/10$ of that of moderately active comets), dominance of large dust grains, and a low dust production of $0.4~\mathrm{kg \cdot s^{-1}}$ at 19~d after the 2014 perihelion passage. We also find a reddish nucleus of 209P/LINEAR that is similar to D-type asteroids and most Trojan asteroids. Meteor observations with the Canadian Meteor Orbit Radar (CMOR), coupled with meteoroid stream modeling, suggest a low dust production of the parent over the past few hundred orbits, although there are hints of a some temporary increase in activity in the 18th century. Dynamical simulations indicate 209P/LINEAR may have resided in a stable near-Earth orbit for $\sim 10^4$~yr, which is significantly longer than typical JFCs. All these lines of evidence imply that 209P/LINEAR as an aging comet quietly exhausting its remaining near surface volatiles. We also compare 209P/LINEAR to other low activity comets, where evidence for a diversity of the origin of low activity is seen.",0
"We present semi-analytical models and simplified $N$-body simulations with $10^4$ and $10^5$ particles aimed at probing the role of dynamical friction (DF) in determining the radial distribution of Blue Straggler Stars (BSSs) in globular clusters. The semi-analytical models show that DF (which is the only evolutionary mechanism at work) is responsible for the formation of a bimodal distribution with a dip progressively moving toward the external regions of the cluster. However, these models fail to reproduce the formation of the long-lived central peak observed in all dynamically evolved clusters. The results of $N$-body simulations confirm the formation of a sharp central peak, which remains as a stable feature over the time regardless of the initial concentration of the system. In spite of a noisy behavior, a bimodal distribution forms in many cases, with the size of the dip increasing as a function of time. In the most advanced stages the distribution becomes monotonic. These results are in agreement with the observations. Also the shape of the peak and the location of the minimum (which in most of the cases is within 10 core radii) turn out to be consistent with observational results. For a more detailed and close comparison with observations, including a proper calibration of the timescales of the dynamical processes driving the evolution of the BSS spatial distribution, more realistic simulations will be necessary.",0
"In the presence of shot noise the charge on a mesoscopic conductor fluctuates. We are interested in the charge fluctuations which arise if the conductor is in the proximity of a gate to which it is coupled by long range Coulomb forces only. Specifically we consider a gate coupled to the edge of a Hall bar subject to a quantizing magnetic field which contains a quantum point contact. The gate is located away from the quantum point contact. We evaluate the charge relaxation resistance for this geometry. The charge relaxation resistance determines the current fluctuations and potential fluctuations induced into the gate. If there is only one edge channel the charge relaxation resistance is determined by transmission and reflection probabilities alone, but in the presence of many channels the density of states of all edge states determines this resistance.",0
"This paper establishes theoretical bonafides for implicit concurrent multivariate effect evaluation--implicit concurrency for short---a broad and versatile computational learning efficiency thought to underlie general-purpose, non-local, noise-tolerant optimization in genetic algorithms with uniform crossover (UGAs). We demonstrate that implicit concurrency is indeed a form of efficient learning by showing that it can be used to obtain close-to-optimal bounds on the time and queries required to approximately correctly solve a constrained version (k=7, \eta=1/5) of a recognizable computational learning problem: learning parities with noisy membership queries. We argue that a UGA that treats the noisy membership query oracle as a fitness function can be straightforwardly used to approximately correctly learn the essential attributes in O(log^1.585 n) queries and O(n log^1.585 n) time, where n is the total number of attributes. Our proof relies on an accessible symmetry argument and the use of statistical hypothesis testing to reject a global null hypothesis at the 10^-100 level of significance. It is, to the best of our knowledge, the first relatively rigorous identification of efficient computational learning in an evolutionary algorithm on a non-trivial learning problem.",0
"We show that the support of any local minimizer of the interaction energy consists of isolated points whenever the interaction potential is of class $C^2$ and mildly repulsive at the origin; moreover, if the minimizer is global, then its support is finite. In addition, for some class of potentials we prove the validity of a uniform upper bound on the cardinal of the support of a global minimizer. Finally, in the one-dimensional case, we give quantitative bounds.",0
"The spectrum and coherency are useful quantities for characterizing the temporal correlations and functional relations within and between point processes. This paper begins with a review of these quantities, their interpretation and how they may be estimated. A discussion of how to assess the statistical significance of features in these measures is included. In addition, new work is presented which builds on the framework established in the review section. This work investigates how the estimates and their error bars are modified by finite sample sizes. Finite sample corrections are derived based on a doubly stochastic inhomogeneous Poisson process model in which the rate functions are drawn from a low variance Gaussian process. It is found that, in contrast to continuous processes, the variance of the estimators cannot be reduced by smoothing beyond a scale which is set by the number of point events in the interval. Alternatively, the degrees of freedom of the estimators can be thought of as bounded from above by the expected number of point events in the interval. Further new work describing and illustrating a method for detecting the presence of a line in a point process spectrum is also presented, corresponding to the detection of a periodic modulation of the underlying rate. This work demonstrates that a known statistical test, applicable to continuous processes, applies, with little modification, to point process spectra, and is of utility in studying a point process driven by a continuous stimulus. While the material discussed is of general applicability to point processes attention will be confined to sequences of neuronal action potentials (spike trains) which were the motivation for this work.",0
"While going deeper has been witnessed to improve the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNN), going smaller for CNN has received increasing attention recently due to its attractiveness for mobile/embedded applications. It remains an active and important topic how to design a small network while retaining the performance of large and deep CNNs (e.g., Inception Nets, ResNets). Albeit there are already intensive studies on compressing the size of CNNs, the considerable drop of performance is still a key concern in many designs. This paper addresses this concern with several new contributions. First, we propose a simple yet powerful method for compressing the size of deep CNNs based on parameter binarization. The striking difference from most previous work on parameter binarization/quantization lies at different treatments of $1\times 1$ convolutions and $k\times k$ convolutions ($k>1$), where we only binarize $k\times k$ convolutions into binary patterns. The resulting networks are referred to as pattern networks. By doing this, we show that previous deep CNNs such as GoogLeNet and Inception-type Nets can be compressed dramatically with marginal drop in performance. Second, in light of the different functionalities of $1\times 1$ (data projection/transformation) and $k\times k$ convolutions (pattern extraction), we propose a new block structure codenamed the pattern residual block that adds transformed feature maps generated by $1\times 1$ convolutions to the pattern feature maps generated by $k\times k$ convolutions, based on which we design a small network with $\sim 1$ million parameters. Combining with our parameter binarization, we achieve better performance on ImageNet than using similar sized networks including recently released Google MobileNets.",0
"The latest results in B physics from the CDF and D0 experiments at the Tevatron are presented, including inclusive b lifetime measurement and exclusive lifetime measurement of the B_s. Promising samples collected by CDF with its Secondary Vertex Trigger are shown as well.",0
Two dimensional stochastic time model of scrape-off layer (SOL) turbulent transport is studied. Instability arisen in the system with respect to the stochastic perturbations of both either density or vorticity reveals itself in the strong outward bursts of particle density propagating ballistically across the SOL. The stability and possible stabilization of the cross- field turbulent system depend very much upon the reciprocal correlation time between density and vorticity fluctuations. Pdf of the particle flux for the large magnitudes of flux events can be modelled with a simple discrete time toy model of random walks concluding at a boundary. The spectra of wandering times feature the pdf of particle flux in the model and qualitatively reproduce the experimental statistics of transport events.,0
"We present a sample of 93 double-mode Cepheids detected in the 2.4 square degree area in the central part of the SMC. 23 stars from the sample pulsate in the fundamental mode and the first overtone while 70 objects are the first and second overtone pulsators. This is the largest sample of such type Cepheids detected in one environment so far. We analyze period ratio of double-mode Cepheids and Fourier parameters of decomposition of the light curves of these objects. We also present location of different type Cepheids from the SMC in the color-magnitude diagram and show their distribution of V-I color indices. We find one object which is probably a blend, either physical or optical, of two Cepheids pulsating in the fundamental mode.",0
"We study x-ray absorption spectra of azobenzene-functionalized self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), investigating excitations from the nitrogen K edge. Azobenzene with H-termination and functionalized with CF3 groups is considered. The Bethe-Salpeter equation is employed to compute the spectra, including excitonic effects, and to determine the character of the near-edge resonances. Our results indicate that core-edge excitations are intense and strongly bound: Their binding energies range from about 6 to 4 eV, going from isolated molecules to densely-packed SAMs. Electron-hole correlation rules these excitations, while the exchange interaction plays a negligible role.",0
"Networks have become increasingly relevant to everyday life as human society has become increasingly connected. Attaining a basic understanding of networks has thus become a necessary form of literacy for people (and for youths in particular). At the NetSci 2014 conference, we initiated a year-long process to develop an educational resource that concisely summarizes essential concepts about networks that can be used by anyone of school age or older. The process involved several brainstorming sessions on one key question: """"What should every person living in the 21st century know about networks by the time he/she finishes secondary education?"""" Different sessions reached diverse participants, which included professional researchers in network science, educators, and high-school students. The generated ideas were connected by the students to construct a concept network. We examined community structure in the concept network to group ideas into a set of important themes, which we refined through discussion into seven essential concepts. The students played a major role in this development process by providing insights and perspectives that were often unrecognized by researchers and educators. The final result, """"Network Literacy: Essential Concepts and Core Ideas"""", is now available as a booklet in several different languages from http://tinyurl.com/networkliteracy .",0
"In this article, we consider the factor complexity of a fixed point of a primitive substitution canonically defined by a beta-numeration system. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition on the Renyi expansion of 1 for having an affine factor complexity map C(n), that is, such that C(n)=an+b for any integer n.",0
"A direct observation of the giant Zeeman splitting of the free excitons in (Ga,Fe)N is reported. The magnetooptical and magnetization data imply the ferromagnetic sign and a reduced magnitude of the effective p-d exchange energy governing the interaction between Fe^{3+} ions and holes in GaN, N_0 beta^(app) = +0.5 +/- 0.2 eV. This finding corroborates the recent suggestion that the strong p-d hybridization specific to nitrides and oxides leads to significant renormalization of the valence band exchange splitting.",0
"Finite precision measurement factors the Hilbert space of a quantum system into a tensor product $H_{coarse} \otimes H_{fine}$. This is mathematically equivalent to the partition into system and environment which forms the arena for decoherence, so we describe the consequences of the inaccessibility of $H_{fine}$ as scale decoherence. Considering the experimentally important case of a harmonic oscillator potential as well as a periodic piecewise constant potential, we show that scale decoherence occurs for inhomogeneous potentials and may explain part of the decoherence observed in recent and proposed experiments on mesoscopic superpositions of quantum states.",0
"Large scale simulations and analytical theory have been combined to obtain the non-equilibrium velocity distribution, $f(v)$, of randomly accelerated particles in suspension. The simulations are based on an event-driven algorithm, generalised to include friction. They reveal strongly anomalous but largely universal distributions which are independent of volume fraction and collision processes, which suggests a one-particle model should capture all the essential features. We have formulated this one-particle model and solved it analytically in the limit of strong damping, where we find that $f(v)$ decays as $1/v$ for multiple decades, eventually crossing over to a Gaussian decay for the largest velocities. Many particle simulations and numerical solution of the one-particle model agree for all values of the damping.",0
"We study one-dimensional itinerant ferromagnets with Heisenberg symmetry near a ferromagnetic quantum critical point. It is shown that the Berry phase term arises in the effective action of itinerant ferromagnets when the full SU(2) symmetry is present. We explicitly demonstrate that dynamical critical exponent of the theory with the Berry term is $z=2 +{\rm O}(\epsilon^2)$ in the sense of $\epsilon$ expansion, as previously discovered in the Ising limit. It appears, however, that the universality class at the interacting fixed point is not the same. We point out that even though the critical theory in the Ising limit can be obtained by the standard Hertz-Millis approach, the Heisenberg limit is expected to be different. We also calculate the exact electron Green functions $G(x,t=0)$ and $G(x=0,t)$ near the transition in a range of temperature, which can be used for experimental signatures of the associated critical points.",0
"Process mining represents an important field in BPM and data mining research. Recently, it has gained importance also for practitioners: more and more companies are creating business process intelligence solutions. The evaluation of process mining algorithms requires, as any other data mining task, the availability of large amount of real-world data. Despite the increasing availability of such datasets, they are affected by many limitations, in primis the absence of a """"gold standard"""" (i.e., the reference model). This paper extends an approach, already available in the literature, for the generation of random processes. Novelties have been introduced throughout the work and, in particular, they involve the complete support for multiperspective models and logs (i.e., the control-flow perspective is enriched with time and data information) and for online settings (i.e., generation of multiperspective event streams and concept drifts). The proposed new framework is able to almost entirely cover the spectrum of possible scenarios that can be observed in the real-world. The proposed approach is implemented as a publicly available Java application, with a set of APIs for the programmatic execution of experiments.",0
"A new component of the cosmic medium, a light scalar field or ''quintessence '', has been proposed recently to explain cosmic acceleration with a dynamical cosmological constant. Such a field is expected to be coupled explicitely to ordinary matter, unless some unknown symmetry prevents it. I investigate the cosmological consequences of such a coupled quintessence (CQ) model, assuming an exponential potential and a linear coupling. This model is conformally equivalent to Brans-Dicke Lagrangians with power-law potential. I evaluate the density perturbations on the cosmic microwave background and on the galaxy distribution at the present and derive bounds on the coupling constant from the comparison with observational data. A novel feature of CQ is that during the matter dominated era the scalar field has a finite and almost constant energy density. This epoch, denoted as $\phi $MDE, is responsible of several differences with respect to uncoupled quintessence: the multipole spectrum of the microwave background is tilted at large angles, the acoustic peaks are shifted, their amplitude is changed, and the present 8Mpc$/h$ density variance is diminished. The present data constrain the dimensionless coupling constant to $|\beta |\leq 0.1$.",0
"In realistic nanoelectronics, disordered impurities/defects are inevitable and play important roles in electron transport. However, due to the lack of effective quantum transport method to do disorder average, the important effects of disorders remain largely un-explored or poorly understood. Here, we report a generalized non-equilibrium vertex correction method with coherent potential approximation for the non-equilibrium quantum transport simulation of disordered nanoelectronics. In this method, the disorder average of various Green's functions are computed by a generalized coherent potential approximation. A generalized non-equilibrium vertex correction algorithm is then developed to calculate disorder average of the product of any two real time single-particle Green's functions. We obtain nine non-equilibrium vertex corrections and find they can be solved by a set of simple linear equations. As a result, the averaged non-equilibrium density matrix and various important transport properties, including averaged current, disordered induced current fluctuation and the averaged shot noise, can all be efficiently computed in a unified simple scheme. Moreover, the relationship between the non-equilibrium vertex correction method and the non-equilibrium coherent potential approximation theory is clarified, and we prove the non-equilibrium coherent potential equals the non-equilibrium vertex correction and this equivalence is guaranteed by the Keldysh's formulas. In addition, a generalized form of conditionally averaged non-equilibrium Green's function is derived to incorporate with density functional theory to enable first-principles quantum transport simulation. Our approach provides a unified, efficient and self-consistent method for simulating non-equilibrium quantum transport through disordered nanoelectronics.",0
"Starting from the defining transformations of complex matrices for the $SO(4,R)$ group, we construct the fundamental representation and the tensor and spinor representations of the group $SO(4,R)$. Given the commutation relations for the corresponding algebra, the unitary representations of the group in terms of the generalized Euler angles are constructed. The crucial step for the Barrett-Crane model in Quantum Gravity is the description of the amplitude for the quantum 4-simplex that is used in the state sum partition function. We obtain the zonal spherical functions for the construction of the SO(4,R) invariant weight and associate them to the triangular faces of the 4-simplices.",0
"Observational manifestations of some models of modified gravity, which have been suggested to explain the accelerated cosmological expansion, are analyzed for gravitating systems with time dependent mass density. It is shown that if the mass density rises with time, the system evolves to the singular state with infinite curvature scalar. The corresponding characteristic time is typically much shorter than the cosmological time.",0
"We consider phononic heat transport through molecular chains connecting two thermal reservoirs. For relatively short molecules at normal temperatures heat conduction is dominated by the harmonic part of the molecular force-field. We develop a general theory for the heat conduction through harmonic chains in 3-dimensions. A Landauer-type expression for the heat conduction is obtained, in agreement with other recent studies. We use this formalism to study the heat conduction properties of alkanes. For relatively short (1-30 carbon atoms) chains the length and temperature dependence of the molecular heat conduction result from the balance of three factors: (i) The molecular frequency spectrum in relation to the frequency cutoff of the thermal reservoirs, (ii) the degree of localization of the molecular normal modes and (iii) the molecule-heat reservoirs coupling. The fact that molecular modes at different frequency regimes have different localization properties gives rise to intricate dependence of the heat conduction on molecular length at different temperatures. For example, the heat conduction increases with molecular length for short molecular chains at low temperatures. Similar considerations apply for isotopically substituted disordered chains. Finally, we compare the heat conduction obtained from this microscopic calculation to that estimated by considering the molecule as a cylinder characterized by a macroscopic heat conduction typical to organic solids. We find that this classical model overestimates the heat conduction of single alkane molecules by about an order of magnitude at room temperature. Implications of the present study to the problem of heating in electrically conducting molecular junctions are pointed out.",0
The dependence of luminosity distance on observed resdhift and the cosmological parameters H and q is derived for a contracting Friedmann universe with no cosmological constant. The result is consistent with recent supernovae observations.,0
"The system comprises of three interconnected power system networks based on thermal, wind and hydro power generation. The load variation in any one of the network results in frequency deviation in all the connected systems.The PI controllers have been connected separately with each system for the frequency control and the gains (Kp and Ki) of all the controllers have been optimized along with frequency bias (Bi) and speed regulation parameter (Ri). The computationally intelligent techniques like bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) have been applied for the tuning of controller gains along with variable parameters Bi and Ri. The gradient descent (GD) based conventional method has also been applied for optimizing the parameters Kp, Ki,Bi and Ri.The frequency responses are obtained with all the methods. The performance index chosen is the integral square error (ISE). The settling time, peak overshoot and peak undershoot of all the frequency responses on applying three optimization techniques have been compared. It has been observed that the peak overshoot and peak undershoot significantly reduce with BFO technique followed by the PSO and GD techniques. While obtaining such optimum response the settling time is increased marginally with bacterial foraging technique due to large number of mathematical equations used for the computation in BFO. The comparison of frequency response using three techniques show the superiority of BFO over the PSO and GD techniques. The designing of the system and tuning of the parameters with three techniques has been done in MATLAB/SIMULINK environment.",0
"We prove that many simply connected symplectic four-manifolds dissolve after connected sum with only one copy of $S^{2}\times S^{2}$. For any finite group G that acts freely on the three-sphere we construct closed smooth four-manifolds with fundamental group G which do not admit metrics of positive scalar curvature, but whose universal covers do admit such metrics.",0
"CoFe${}_{2}$O${}_{4}$ (CFO)-BiFeO${}_{3}$ (BFO) nanocomposites are an intriguing option for future memory and logic technologies due to the magnetoelctric properties of the system. However, these nanocomposites form with CFO pillars randomly located within a BFO matrix, making implementation in devices difficult. To overcome this, we present a technique to produce patterned nanocomposites through self-assembly. CFO islands are patterned on Nb-doped SrTiO${}_{3}$ to direct the self-assembly of epitaxial CFO-BFO nanocomposites, producing square arrays of CFO pillars.",0
"The hadronic invariant mass spectrum for the inclusive charmless semileptonic decay $B\to X_u e \bar\nu_e$ is studied. Particular attention is paid to the region $s_H<m_D^2$, which may be useful for extracting the value of $|V_{ub}|$. The sensitivity of the spectrum to the parameter $\bar\Lambda \equiv m_B - m_b$ is explored. Perturbative QCD corrections to $d\Gamma/ds_H$ of order $\alpha_s^2\beta_0$ are calculated. For $s_H \sim \bar\Lambda m_b$ nonperturbative QCD effects are important and the shape of the invariant mass spectrum is controlled by the B meson matrix element of an infinite sum of local operators. The utility of the hadronic mass spectrum for extracting $|V_{ub}|$ is explored.",0
"The wide adoption of machine learning approaches in the industry, government, medicine and science has renewed the interest in interpretable machine learning: many decisions are too important to be delegated to black-box techniques such as deep neural networks or kernel SVMs. Historically, problems of learning interpretable classifiers, including classification rules or decision trees, have been approached by greedy heuristic methods as essentially all the exact optimization formulations are NP-hard. Our primary contribution is a MaxSAT-based framework, called MLIC, which allows principled search for interpretable classification rules expressible in propositional logic. Our approach benefits from the revolutionary advances in the constraint satisfaction community to solve large-scale instances of such problems. In experimental evaluations over a collection of benchmarks arising from practical scenarios, we demonstrate its effectiveness: we show that the formulation can solve large classification problems with tens or hundreds of thousands of examples and thousands of features, and to provide a tunable balance of accuracy vs. interpretability. Furthermore, we show that in many problems interpretability can be obtained at only a minor cost in accuracy. The primary objective of the paper is to show that recent advances in the MaxSAT literature make it realistic to find optimal (or very high quality near-optimal) solutions to large-scale classification problems. The key goal of the paper is to excite researchers in both interpretable classification and in the CP community to take it further and propose richer formulations, and to develop bespoke solvers attuned to the problem of interpretable ML.",0
"This paper presents a method for calculating the wall shear rate in pipe turbulent flow. It collapses adequately the data measured in laminar flow and turbulent flow into a single flow curve and gives the basis for the design of turbulent flow viscometers. Key words: non-Newtonian, wall shear rate, turbulent, rheometer",0
"We pursue the hypothesis that the events with a large rapidity gap, observed at HERA, reflect the scattering of electrons off lumps of wee partons inside the proton. A simple scaling behaviour is predicted for the diffractive structure functions, which are related to the inclusive structure function $F_2(x,Q^2)$ at small values of the scaling variable $x$. The results are compared with recent measurements of the diffractive structure function $F_2^D(x,Q^2,M^2)$.",0
"There are two main reasons for the recent renewal of interest in cosmic strings: Fundamental string-theory models suggest their existence; and there are at least two tentative observations of their possible effects. In this talk, I review their current status in the light of these two factors.",0
"We unite two well known generalisations of the Wadge theory. The first one considers more general reducing functions than the continuous functions in the classical case, and the second one extends Wadge reducibility from sets (i.e., $\{0,1\}$-valued functions) to $Q$-valued functions, for a better quasiorder $Q$. In this article, we consider more general reducibilities on the $Q$-valued functions and generalise some results of L. Motto Ros in the first direction and of T. Kihara and A. Montalb\'an in the second direction: Our main result states that the structure of the $\mathbf{\Delta}^0_\alpha$-degrees of $\mathbf{\Delta}^0_{\alpha+\gamma}$-measurable $Q$-valued functions is isomorphic to the $\mathbf{\Delta}^0_\beta$-degrees of $\mathbf{\Delta}^0_{\beta+\gamma}$-measurable $Q$-valued functions, and these are isomorphic to the generalized homomorphism order on the $\gamma$-th iterated $Q$-labeled forests.",0
"The flavor changing transitions in the c->u gamma, c->u gamma gamma and c->u l+ l- offer the possibility to search for new physics in the charm sector. We investigate dominant decay mechanisms in the radiative decays D->V gamma, D->P(V) l+ l-, D->gamma gamma and we discuss chances to see physics beyond the standard model in these decays. In addition, we analyze Cabibbo allowed D->K pi gamma decays with nonresonant K pi, and we probe the role of light vector mesons in these decays.",0
"We compute the entanglement entropy, in real space, of the ground state of the integer Quantum Hall states for three different domains embedded in the torus, the disk and the sphere. We establish the validity of the area law with a vanishing value of the topological entanglement entropy. The entropy per unit length of the perimeter depends on the filling fraction, but it is independent of the geometry.",0
"We consider the problem of creating a long-distance entangled state between two stations of a network, where neighboring nodes are connected by noisy quantum channels. We show that any two stations can share an entangled pair if the effective probability for the quantum errors is below a certain threshold, which is achieved by using local redundant encoding to preserve the global phase and network-based correction for the bit-flip errors. In contrast to the convensional quantum repeater schemes we are not limited by the memory coherence time, because all quantum operations only use one-way classical communication and can be done in one shot. Meanwhile, the overhead of local resources only increases logarithmically with the size of the network, making our proposal favorable to practical applications of long-distance quantum communication.",0
"To mine large digital libraries in humanistically meaningful ways, scholars need to divide them by genre. This is a task that classification algorithms are well suited to assist, but they need adjustment to address the specific challenges of this domain. Digital libraries pose two problems of scale not usually found in the article datasets used to test these algorithms. 1) Because libraries span several centuries, the genres being identified may change gradually across the time axis. 2) Because volumes are much longer than articles, they tend to be internally heterogeneous, and the classification task needs to begin with segmentation. We describe a multi-layered solution that trains hidden Markov models to segment volumes, and uses ensembles of overlapping classifiers to address historical change. We test this approach on a collection of 469,200 volumes drawn from HathiTrust Digital Library. To demonstrate the humanistic value of these methods, we extract 32,209 volumes of fiction from the digital library, and trace the changing proportions of first- and third-person narration in the corpus. We note that narrative points of view seem to have strong associations with particular themes and genres.",0
"Extending our earlier work on PSL(2|2), we explain how to reduce the solution of WZNW models on general type I supergroups to those defined on the bosonic subgroup. The new analysis covers in particular the supergroups GL(M|N) along with several close relatives such as PSL(N|N), certain Poincare supergroups and the series OSP(2|2N). This remarkable progress relies on the use of a special Feigin-Fuchs type representation. In preparation for the field theory analysis, we shall exploit a minisuperspace analogue of a free fermion construction to deduce the spectrum of the Laplacian on type I supergroups. The latter is shown to be non-diagonalizable. After lifting these results to the full WZNW model, we address various issues of the field theory, including its modular invariance and the computation of correlation functions. In agreement with previous findings, supergroup WZNW models allow to study chiral and non-chiral aspects of logarithmic conformal field theory within a geometric framework. We shall briefly indicate how insights from WZNW models carry over to non-geometric examples, such as e.g. the W(p) triplet models.",0
"We study the dynamics of scalar metric fluctuations in a non-perturbative variational formalism recently introduced, by which the dynamics of an geometrical scalar field $\theta$, describes the quantum geometrical effects on a Weylian-like manifold with respect to a background Riemannian space-time. In this letter we have examined an example in the framework of inflationary cosmology. The resulting spectral predictions are in very good agreement with observations and other models of inflation.",0
"In this paper we introduce a new diagnostic technique that uses prominence EUV and UV absorption to determine the prominence plasma electron temperature and column emission measure, as well as He/H relative abundance; if a realistic assumption on the geometry of the absorbing plasma can be made, this technique can also yield the absorbing plasma electron density. This technique capitalizes on the absorption properties of Hydrogen and Helium at different wavelength ranges and temperature regimes. Several cases where this technique can be successfully applied are described. This technique works best when prominence plasmas are hotter than 15,000 K and thus it is ideally suited for rapidly heating erupting prominences observed during the initial phases of coronal mass ejections. An example is made using simulated intensities of 4 channels of the SDO/AIA instrument. This technique can be easily applied to existing observations from almost all space missions devoted to the study of the solar atmosphere, which we list.",0
"The experimental STM images for the CDW phase of the blue bronze RbMoO3 have been successfully explained on the basis of first-principles DFT calculations. Although the density of states near the Fermi level strongly concentrates in two of the three types of Mo atoms Mo-II and Mo-III, the STM measurement mostly probes the contribution of the uppermost O atoms of the surface, associated with the Mo-IO6 octahedra. In addition, it is found that the surface concentration of Rb atoms plays a key role in determining the surface nesting vector and hence the periodicity of the CDW modulation. Significant experimental inhomogeneities of the b* surface component of the wavevector of the modulation, probed by STM, are reported. The calculated changes in the surface nesting vector are consistent with the observed experimental inhomogeneities.",0
"Let ${\mathcal A}$ denote the family of all functions $f$ analytic in the unit disk $\ID$ and satisfying the normalization $f(0)=0= f'(0)-1$. Let $\mathcal{S}$ denote the subclass of ${\mathcal A}$ consisting of univalent functions in $\ID$. We consider the subclass $\mathcal{U} $ of $\mathcal{S}$ that is defined by the condition that for its members $f$ the condition $$\left |\left (\frac{z}{f(z)} \right )^{2}f'(z)-1\right | < 1 ~\mbox{ for $z\in \ID$} $$ holds. To theses relations belong striking similarities and on the other hand big differences. We show that some results about $\mathcal{S}$ can be improved for $\mathcal{U}$, while others cannot.",0
"In this letter, we study the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) concept in 3-D bipolar ad hoc networks with spatial randomness. Due to three spatial dimensions of the network, we introduce a 3-D antenna sectorization that exploits the horizontal and the vertical spatial separation. The impact of 3-D antenna sectorization on SWIPT performance is evaluated for the power-splitting technique by using stochastic geometry tools. Theoretical and numerical results show that 3-D sectorization achieves a more accurate beam steering in the 3-D space, which can be beneficial for both the information and the power transfer.",0
"In this work we give a mechanical (Hamiltonian) interpretation of the so called spectrality property introduced by Sklyanin and Kuznetsov in the context of B\""""acklund transformations (BTs) for finite dimensional integrable systems. The property turns out to be deeply connected with the Hamilton-Jacobi separation of variables and can lead to the explicit integration of the underlying model through the expression of the BTs. Once such construction is given, it is shown, in a simple example, that it is possible to interpret the Baxter Q operator defining the quantum BTs us the Green's function, or propagator, of the time dependent Schr\""""odinger equation for the interpolating Hamiltonian.",0
"We derive the lowest-temperature correction to the self-energy of a spin-up particle injected in a ferromagnetic background. The background is modeled with both Heisenberg and Ising Hamiltonians so that differences due to gapless vs. gapped magnons can be understood. Beside the expected thermal broadening of the quasiparticle peak as it becomes a resonance inside a continuum, we also find that spectral weight is transferred to regions lying outside this continuum. We explain the origin of this spectral weight transfer and its low-temperature evolution.",0
"Let S_{n,k} denote the random geometric graph obtained by placing points inside a square of area n according to a Poisson point process of intensity 1 and joining each such point to the k=k(n) points of the process nearest to it. In this paper we show that if Pr(S_{n,k} connected) > n^{-\gamma_1} then the probability that S_{n,k} contains a pair of `small' components `close' to each other is o(n^{-c_1}) (in a precise sense of `small' and 'close'), for some absolute constants \gamma_1>0 and c_1 >0. This answers a question of Walters. (A similar result was independently obtained by Balister.) As an application of our result, we show that the distribution of the connected components of S_{n,k} below the connectivity threshold is asymptotically Poisson.",0
"Technology offers great potential to overcome physical barriers of human race. This paper presents the methods of enhanced learning applicable to children having special needs using better human-computer interaction.

"Dark matter halo clustering depends not only on halo mass, but also on other properties such as concentration and shape. This phenomenon is known broadly as assembly bias. We explore the dependence of assembly bias on halo definition, parametrized by spherical overdensity parameter, $\Delta$. We summarize the strength of concentration-, shape-, and spin-dependent halo clustering as a function of halo mass and halo definition. Concentration-dependent clustering depends strongly on mass at all $\Delta$. For conventional halo definitions ($\Delta \sim 200\mathrm{m}-600\mathrm{m}$), concentration-dependent clustering at low mass is driven by a population of haloes that is altered through interactions with neighbouring haloes. Concentration-dependent clustering can be greatly reduced through a mass-dependent halo definition with $\Delta \sim 20\mathrm{m}-40\mathrm{m}$ for haloes with $M_{200\mathrm{m}} \lesssim 10^{12}\, h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Smaller $\Delta$ implies larger radii and mitigates assembly bias at low mass by subsuming altered, so-called backsplash haloes into now larger host haloes. At higher masses ($M_{200\mathrm{m}} \gtrsim 10^{13}\, h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) larger overdensities, $\Delta \gtrsim 600\mathrm{m}$, are necessary. Shape- and spin-dependent clustering are significant for all halo definitions that we explore and exhibit a relatively weaker mass dependence. Generally, both the strength and the sense of assembly bias depend on halo definition, varying significantly even among common definitions. We identify no halo definition that mitigates all manifestations of assembly bias. A halo definition that mitigates assembly bias based on one halo property (e.g., concentration) must be mass dependent. The halo definitions that best mitigate concentration-dependent halo clustering do not coincide with the expected average splashback radii at fixed halo mass.",0

Then we investigat the invariant solutions.",0
"The renormalization scheme for the Wick expansion of a modified version of the perturbative QCD introduced in previous works is discussed. Massless QCD is considered, by implementing the usual multiplicative scaling of the gluon and quark wave functions and vertices. However, also massive quark and gluon counter-terms are allowed in this mass less theory since the condensates are expected to generate masses. A natural set of expansion parameters of the physical quantities is introduced: the coupling itself and to masses $m_q$ and $m_g$ associated to quarks and gluons respectively. This procedure allows to implement a dimensional transmutation effect through these new mass scales. A general expression for the new generating functional in terms of the mass parameters $m_q$ and $m_g$ is obtained in terms of integrals over arbitrary but constant gluon or quark fields in each case. Further, the one loop potential, is evaluated in more detail in the case when only the quark condensate is retained. This lowest order result again indicates the dynamical generation of quark condensates in the vacuum.",0
"We present a new precision radial velocity dataset that reveals a multi-planet system orbiting the G0V star HD 34445. Our 18-year span consists of 333 precision radial velocity observations, 56 of which were previously published, and 277 which are new data from Keck Observatory, Magellan at Las Campanas Observatory, and the Automated Planet Finder at Lick Observatory. These data indicate the presence of six planet candidates in Keplerian motion about the host star with periods of 1057, 215, 118, 49, 677, and 5700 days, and minimum masses of 0.63, 0.17, 0.1, 0.05, 0.12 and 0.38 Jupiter masses respectively. The HD 34445 planetary system, with its high degree of multiplicity, its long orbital periods, and its induced stellar radial velocity half-amplitudes in the range $2 \,{\rm m\, s^{-1}} \lesssim K \lesssim 5\,{\rm m\, s^{-1}}$ is fundamentally unlike either our own solar system (in which only Jupiter and Saturn induce significant reflex velocities for the Sun), or the Kepler multiple-transiting systems (which tend to have much more compact orbital configurations)",0
"Room temperature angle-dispersive x-ray diffraction measurements on zircon-type EuVO4, LuVO4, and ScVO4 were performed up to 27 GPa. In the three compounds we found evidence of a pressure-induced structural phase transformation from zircon to a scheelite-type structure. The onset of the transition is near 8 GPa, but the transition is sluggish and the low- and high-pressure phases coexist in a pressure range of about 10 GPa. In EuVO4 and LuVO4 a second transition to a M-fergusonite-type phase was found near 21 GPa. The equations of state for the zircon and scheelite phases are also determined. Among the three studied compounds, we found that ScVO4 is less compressible than EuVO4 and LuVO4, being the most incompressible orthovanadate studied to date. The sequence of structural transitions and compressibilities are discussed in comparison with other zircon-type oxides.",0
The eigenvalue distribution is investigated for matrix models related via the localization to Chern-Simons-matter theories.

"Speaker diarization, usually denoted as the ''who spoke when'' task, turns out to be particularly challenging when applied to fictional films, where many characters talk in various acoustic conditions (background music, sound effects...). Despite this acoustic variability , such movies exhibit specific visual patterns in the dialogue scenes. In this paper, we introduce a two-step method to achieve speaker diarization in TV series: a speaker diarization is first performed locally in the scenes detected as dialogues; then, the hypothesized local speakers are merged in a second agglomerative clustering process, with the constraint that speakers locally hypothesized to be distinct must not be assigned to the same cluster. The performances of our approach are compared to those obtained by standard speaker diarization tools applied to the same data.",0

The crystal structure is a collapsed-tetragonal ThCr2Si2-type structure as previously reported, but with 7(1)% vacancies on the Co sites corresponding to the composition CaCo{1.86(2)}As2. The thermal expansion coefficients for both the a- and c-axes are positive from 10 to 300 K. Neutron diffraction measurements on single crystals demonstrate the onset of A-type collinear antiferromagnetic order below the Neel temperature TN = 52(1) K with the ordered moments directed along the tetragonal c-axis, aligned ferromagnetically in the ab-plane and antiferromagnetically stacked along the c-axis.",0
"All available photometric and spectroscopic observations were collected and used as the basis of a detailed analysis of the close binary IM Mon. The orbital period of the binary was refined to 1.19024249(0.00000014) days. The Roche equipotentials, fractional luminosities (in (B, V) and H_p bands) and fractional radii for the component stars in addition to mass ratio q, inclination i of the orbit and the effective temperature T_eff of the secondary cooler less massive component were obtained by the analysis of light curves. IM Mon is classified to be a detached binary system in contrast to the contact configuration estimations in the literature. The absolute parameters of IM Mon were derived by the simultaneous solutions of light and radial velocity curves as M_1,2=5.50(0.24)M_o and 3.32(0.16)M_o, R1,2=3.15(0.04)R_o and 2.36(0.03)R_o, T_eff1,2=17500(350) K and 14500(550) K implying spectral types of B4 and B6.5 ZAMS stars for the primary and secondary components respectively. The modelling of the high resolution spectrum revealed the rotational velocities of the component stars as V_rot1=147(15) km/s and V_rot2=90(25) km/s. The photometric distance of 353(59) pc was found more precise and reliable than Hipparcos distance of 341(85) pc. An evolutionary age of 11.5(1.5) Myr was obtained for IM Mon. Kinematical and dynamical analysis support the membership of the young thin-disk population system IM Mon to the Ori OB1a association dynamically. Finally, we derived the distance, age and metallicity information of Ori OB1a sub-group using the information of IM Mon parameters.",0
"We study magnetization transport in anisotropic spin-$1/2$ chains governed by the integrable XXZ model with and without integrability-breaking perturbations at high temperatures ($T\to \infty$) using a hybrid approach that combines exact sum-rules with judiciously chosen Ans\""""atze. In the integrable XXZ model we find (i) super-diffusion at the isotropic (Heisenberg) point, with frequency dependent conductivity $ \sigma'(\omega\to 0) \sim |\omega|^{\alpha}$, where $\alpha=-3/7$ in close numerical agreement with recent $t$-DMRG computations; (ii) a continuously drifting exponent from $\alpha=-1^+$ in the XY limit of the model to $\alpha>0$ within the Ising regime; and (iii) a diffusion constant saturating in the XY coupling deep in the Ising limit. We consider two kinds of integrability breaking perturbations --- a simple next-nearest-neighbor spin-flip term ($J_2$) and a three-spin assisted variant ($t_2$), natural in the fermion particle representation of the spin chain. In the first case we discover a remarkable sensitivity of $\sigma'(\omega)$ to the sign of $J_2$, with enhanced low frequency spectral weight and a pronounced upward shift in the magnitude of $\alpha$ for $J_2>0$. Perhaps even more surprising, we find sub-diffusion ($\alpha>0$) over a range of $J_2<0$. By contrast, the effects of the \enquote{fermionic} three-spin perturbation are sign symmetric; this perturbation produces a clearly observable hydrodynamic relaxation. At large strength of the integrability breaking term $J_2\to \pm \infty$ the problem is effectively non-interacting (fermions hopping on odd and even sublattices) and we find $\alpha\to -1$ behavior reminiscent of the XY limit of the XXZ chain. Exact diagonalization studies largely corroborate these findings at mid-frequencies.",0
"Beginning with the Pauli-Fierz theory, we construct a model for multi-graviton theory. Couplings between gravitons belonging to nearest-neighbor ``theory spaces'' lead to a discrete mass spectrum. Our model coincides with the Kaluza-Klein theory whose fifth dimension is latticized. We evaluate one-loop vacuum energy in models with a circular latticized extra dimension as well as with compact continuous dimensions. We find that the vacuum energy can take a positive value, if the dimension of the continuous space time is $6, 10,...$. Moreover, since the amount of the vacuum energy can be an arbitrary small value according to the choice of parameters in the model, our models is useful to explain the small positive dark energy in the present universe.",0
In this note we are going to consider a smooth projective surface equipped with an involution and study the action of the involution at the level of Chow group of zero cycles.,0
"We report the discovery of a quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) at 61.0+/-1.7 Hz with the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer in the low-mass X-ray binary and persistently bright atoll source GX 13+1 (4U 1811-17). The QPO had an rms amplitude of 1.7+/-0.2 % (2-13.0 keV) and a FWHM of 15.9+/-4.2 Hz. Its frequency increased with count rate and its amplitude increased with photon energy. In addition a peaked noise component was found with a cut-off frequency around 2 Hz, a power law index of around -4, and an rms amplitude of ~1.8 %, probably the well known atoll source high frequency noise. It was only found when the QPO was detected. Very low frequency noise was present with a power law index of ~1, and an rms amplitude of ~4 %. A second observation showed similar variability components. In the X-ray color-color diagram the source did not trace out the usual banana branch, but showed a two branched structure. This is the first detection of a QPO in one of the four persistently bright atoll sources in the galactic bulge. We argue that the QPO properties indicate that it is the same phenomenon as the horizontal branch oscillations (HBO) in Z sources. That HBO might turn up in the persistently bright atoll sources was previously suggested on the basis of the magnetospheric beat frequency model for HBO. We discuss the properties of the new phenomenon within the framework of this model.",0
"The coupling of lattice deformations to the low energy electronic excitations of Dirac matter involve novel types of electron--phonon couplings as the celebrated elastic gauge fields first analyzed in graphene. In the continuum low energy approach, lattice deformations coupling to the electronic degrees of freedom are characterized by the (symmetric) strain tensor defined in elasticity theory. We review these couplings in Weyl semimetals and examine the coupling of electronic excitations to the antisymmetric part of the deformation gradient tensor associated to rotational strain. The new couplings, absent in the two dimensional materials, have important physical implications: they give rise to new elastic gauge fields, contribute to the deformation potential, tilt the cones and generate new pseudo--Zeeman couplings.",0
"In this paper, we introduce a novel, non-recursive, maximal matching algorithm for double auctions, which aims to maximize the amount of commodities to be traded. It differs from the usual equilibrium matching, which clears a market at the equilibrium price. We compare the two algorithms through experimental analyses, showing that the maximal matching algorithm is favored in scenarios where trading volume is a priority and that it may possibly improve allocative efficiency over equilibrium matching as well. A parameterized algorithm that incorporates both maximal matching and equilibrium matching as special cases is also presented to allow flexible control on how much to trade in a double auction.",0
"Methods of Computational Fluid Dynamics are applied to simulate pulsatile blood flow in human vessels and in the aortic arch. The non-Newtonian behaviour of the human blood is investigated in simple vessels of actual size. A detailed time-dependent mathematical convergence test has been carried out. The realistic pulsatile flow is used in all simulations. Results of computer simulations of the blood flow in vessels of two different geometries are presented. For pressure, strain rate and velocity component distributions we found significant disagreements between our results obtained with realistic non-Newtonian treatment of human blood and widely used method in literature: a simple Newtonian approximation. A significant increase of the strain rate and, as a result, wall sear stress distribution, is found in the region of the aortic arch. We consider this result as theoretical evidence that supports existing clinical observations and those models not using non-Newtonian treatment underestimate the risk of disruption to the human vascular system.",0
"In this paper, we introduce a unified framework of Tensor Higher-Degree Eigenvalue Complementarity Problem (THDEiCP), which goes beyond the framework of the typical Quadratic Eigenvalue Complementarity Problem (QEiCP) for matrices. First, we study some topological properties of higher-degree cone eigenvalues of tensors. Based upon the symmetry assumptions on the underlying tensors, we then reformulate THDEiCP as a weakly coupled homogeneous polynomial optimization problem, which might be greatly helpful for designing implementable algorithms to solve the problem under consideration numerically. As more general theoretical results, we present the results concerning existence of solutions of THDEiCP without symmetry conditions. Finally, we propose an easily implementable algorithm to solve THDEiCP, and report some computational results.",0
"In this paper, using the Bondi coordinates, we discuss the angular momentum at null infinity in five dimensions and address the Poincare covariance of the Bondi mass and angular momentum. We also show the angular momentum loss/gain law due to gravitational waves. In four dimensions, the angular momentum at null infinity has the supertranslational ambiguity and then it is known that we cannot construct well-defined angular momentum there. On the other hand, we would stress that we can define angular momentum at null infinity without any ambiguity in higher dimensions. This is because of the non-existence of supertranslations in higher dimensions.",0
"Starting from the d-wave RVB mean-field theory of Kotliar and Liu, we present a new, long-wavelength/low-energy exact, treatment of gauge fluctuations. The result is a theory of gapless fermion quasiparticles coupled to superconducting phase fluctuations. We will discuss the physical implications, and the similarity/differences with a theory of BCS pairing with phase fluctuations.",0
"We describe, by their holonomy groups, all complete simply connected irreducible non-locally symmetric pseudo-Riemannian SpinC manifolds which admit parallel spinors. So we generalize the Riemannian SpinC case and the pseudo-Riemannian Spin one.",0
"The 30 Doradus (30 Dor) nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is the brightest HII region in the Local Group and a prototype starburst similar to those found in high redshift galaxies. It is thus a stepping stone to understand the complex formation processes of stars in starburst regions across the Universe. Here, we have studied the formation history of massive stars in 30 Dor using masses and ages derived for 452 mainly OB stars from the spectroscopic VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey (VFTS). We find that stars of all ages and masses are scattered throughout 30 Dor. This is remarkable because it implies that massive stars either moved large distances or formed independently over the whole field of view in relative isolation. We find that both channels contribute to the 30 Dor massive star population. Massive star formation rapidly accelerated about 8 Myr ago, first forming stars in the field before giving birth to the stellar populations in NGC 2060 and NGC 2070. The R136 star cluster in NGC 2070 formed last and, since then, about 1 Myr ago, star formation seems to be diminished with some continuing in the surroundings of R136. Massive stars within a projected distance of 8 pc of R136 are not coeval but show an age range of up to 6 Myr. Our mass distributions are well populated up to $200\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. The inferred IMF is shallower than a Salpeter-like IMF and appears to be the same across 30 Dor. By comparing our sample of stars to stellar models in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, we find evidence for missing physics in the models above $\log L/\mathrm{L}_\odot=6$ that is likely connected to enhanced wind mass loss for stars approaching the Eddington limit.

"We show that in s-wave superfluids of cold fermionic atoms with laser-field-generated effective spin-orbit interactions, a topological phase with gapless edge states and Majorana fermion quasiparticles obeying the non-Abelian statistics is realized in the case with a large Zeeman magnetic field. Our scenario provides a promising approach for quantum computation manipulating non-Abelian anyons via an s-wave Feshbach resonance.",0
"We compare the phylogenetic tensors for various trees and networks for two, three and four taxa. If the probability spaces between one tree or network and another are not identical then there will be phylogenetic tensors that could have arisen on one but not the other. We call these two trees or networks distinguishable from each other. We show that for the binary symmetric model there are no two-taxon trees and networks that are distinguishable from each other, however there are three-taxon trees and networks that are distinguishable from each other. We compare the time parameters for the phylogenetic tensors for various taxon label permutations on a given tree or network. If the time parameters on one taxon label permutation in terms of the other taxon label permutation are all non-negative then we say that the two taxon label permutations are not network identifiable from each other. We show that some taxon label permutations are network identifiable from each other. We show that some four-taxon networks satisfy the four-point condition. Of the two """"shapes"""" of four-taxon rooted trees, one is defined by the cluster, b,c,d, labelling taxa alphabetically from left to right. The network with this shape and convergence between the two taxa with the root as their most recent common ancestor satisfies the four-point condition. The phylogenetic tensors contain polynomial equations that cannot be easily solved for four-taxon or higher trees or networks. We show how methods from algebraic geometry, such as Gr\""""obner bases, can be used to solve the polynomial equations. We show that some four-taxon trees and networks can be distinguished from each other.",0
"Paraxial linear propagation of light in an optical waveguide with material gain and loss is governed by a Schr\""""odinger equation with a complex potential. Properties of parity-time-symmetric complex potentials have been heavily studied before. In this article, new classes of non-parity-time-symmetric complex potentials featuring conjugate-pair eigenvalue symmetry in its spectrum are constructed by operator symmetry methods. Due to this eigenvalue symmetry, it is shown that the spectrum of these complex potentials is often all-real. Under parameter tuning in these potentials, phase transition can also occur, where pairs of complex eigenvalues appear in the spectrum. A peculiar feature of the phase transition here is that, the complex eigenvalues may bifurcate out from an interior continuous eigenvalue inside the continuous spectrum, in which case a phase transition takes place without going through an exceptional point. In one spatial dimension, this class of non-parity-time-symmetric complex potentials is of the form $V(x)=h'(x)-h^2(x)$, where $h(x)$ is an arbitrary parity-time-symmetric complex function. These potentials in two spatial dimensions are also derived. Diffraction patterns in these complex potentials are further examined, and unidirectional propagation behaviors are demonstrated.",0
"A weak fluctuating magnetic field embedded into a turbulent conducting medium grows exponentially while its characteristic scale decays. In the ISM and protogalactic plasmas, the magnetic Pr is very large, so a broad spectrum of growing magnetic fluctuations is excited at subviscous scales. We study the statistical correlations that are set up in the field pattern and show that the magnetic-field lines possess a folding structure, where most of the scale decrease is due to rapid transverse field direction reversals, while the scale of the field variation along itself stays approximately constant. Specifically, we find that the field strength and the field-line curvature are anticorrelated, and the curvature possesses a stationary limiting distribution with the bulk located at the values of curvature comparable to the characteristic wave number of the velocity field and a power tail extending to large values of curvature. The regions of large curvature, therefore, occupy only a small fraction of the total volume of the system. Our theoretical results are corroborated by direct numerical simulations. The implication of the folding effect is that the advent of the Lorentz back reaction occurs when the magnetic energy approaches that of the smallest turbulent eddies. Our results also directly apply to the problem of statistical geometry of the material lines in a random flow.",0
"We present a scenario where dark matter is in the form of dark atoms that can accomodate the experimentally observed excess of positrons in PAMELA and AMS-02 while being compatible with the constraints imposed on the gamma-ray flux from Fermi/LAT. This scenario assumes that the dominant component of dark matter is in the form of a bound state between a helium nucleus and a $-2$ particle and a small component is in the form of a WIMP-like dark atom compatible with direct searches in underground detectors. One of the constituents of this WIMP-like state is a $+2$ metastable particle with a mass of 1 TeV or slightly below that by decaying to $e^+e^+$, $\mu^+ \mu^+$ and $\tau^+ \tau^+$ produces the observed positron excess. These decays can naturally take place via GUT interactions. If it exists, such a metastable particle can be found in the next run of LHC. The model predicts also the ratio of leptons over baryons in the Universe to be close to -3.",0
"A gradient dynamics model based on an extended interface Hamiltonian is presented that is able to describe the dynamics of structuring processes in thin films of liquid mixtures, solutions and suspensions on solid substrates including coupled dewetting and decomposition. After discussing known limiting cases the model is employed to investigate the dewetting of thin films of liquid mixtures and suspensions under the influence of effective long-range van der Waals forces that depend on solute concentration. The occurring fluxes are discussed and it is shown that spinodal dewetting may be triggered through the coupling of film height and concentration fluctuations. Fully nonlinear calculations provide the time evolution and resulting steady film height and concentration profiles.",0
"We study languages and formal power series associated to (variants of) Hammersley's process. We show that the ordinary Hammersley process yields a regular language and the Hammersley tree process yields deterministic context-free (but non-regular) languages. For the extension to intervals of the Hammersley process we show that there are two relevant formal languages. One of them leads to the same class of languages as the ordinary Hammersley tree process. The other one yields non-context-free languages. The results are motivated by the problem of studying the analog of the famous Ulam-Hammersley problem for heapable sequences. Towards this goal we also give an algorithm for computing formal power series associated to the variants of Hammersley's process. We employ these algorithms to settle the nature of the scaling constant, conjectured in previous work to be the golden ratio. Our results provide experimental support to this conjecture.",0
"The charge asymmetry in the differential cross section of high-energy $\mu^+\mu^-$ photoproduction in the electric field of a heavy atom is obtained. This asymmetry arises due to the Coulomb corrections to the amplitude of the process (next-to-leading term with respect to the atomic field). The deviation of the nuclear electric field from the Coulomb field at small distances is crucially important for the charge asymmetry. Though the Coulomb corrections to the total cross section are negligibly small, the charge asymmetry is measurable for selected final states of $\mu^+$ and $\mu^-$. We further discuss the feasibility for experimental observation of this effect.",0
"Observations show that galaxies and their interstellar media are pervaded by strong magnetic fields with energies in the diffuse component being at least comparable to the thermal and even as large or larger than the turbulent energy. Such strong magnetic fields prevent the formation of stars because patches of the interstellar medium are magnetically subcritical. Here we present the results from global numerical simulations of strongly magnetised and self-gravitating galactic discs, which show that the buoyancy of the magnetic field due to the Parker instability leads at first to the formation of giant filamentary regions. These filamentary structures become gravitationally unstable and fragment into $\sim10^5 M_{\odot}$ clouds that attract kpc long, coherent filamentary flows that build them into GMCs. Our results thus provide a solution to the long-standing problem of how the transition from sub- to supercritical regions in the interstellar medium proceeds.",0
We consider the two-dimensional discrete scan statistic generated by a block-factor type model obtained from i.i.d. sequence. We present an approximation for the distribution of the scan statistics and the corresponding error bounds. A simulation study illustrates our methodology.,0
"We give in this paper a convergence result concerning parallel asynchronous algorithm with bounded delays to solve a nonlinear fixed point problems.

"Data science teams often collaboratively analyze datasets, generating dataset versions at each stage of iterative exploration and analysis. There is a pressing need for a system that can support dataset versioning, enabling such teams to efficiently store, track, and query across dataset versions. We introduce OrpheusDB, a dataset version control system that """"bolts on"""" versioning capabilities to a traditional relational database system, thereby gaining the analytics capabilities of the database """"for free"""". We develop and evaluate multiple data models for representing versioned data, as well as a light-weight partitioning scheme, LyreSplit, to further optimize the models for reduced query latencies. With LyreSplit, OrpheusDB is on average 1000x faster in finding effective (and better) partitionings than competing approaches, while also reducing the latency of version retrieval by up to 20x relative to schemes without partitioning. LyreSplit can be applied in an online fashion as new versions are added, alongside an intelligent migration scheme that reduces migration time by 10x on average.",0
"Self-serving, rational agents sometimes cooperate to their mutual benefit. The two-player iterated prisoner's dilemma game is a model for including the emergence of cooperation. It is generally believed that there is no simple ultimatum strategy which a player can control the return of the other participants. The recent discovery of the powerful class of zero-determinant strategies in the iterated prisoner's dilemma dramatically expands our understanding of the classic game by uncovering strategies that provide a unilateral advantage to sentient players pitted against unwitting opponents. However, strategies in the prisoner's dilemma game are only two strategies. Are there these results for general multi-strategy games? To address this question, the paper develops a theory for zero-determinant strategies for multi-strategy games, with any number of strategies. The analytical results exhibit a similar yet different scenario to the case of two-strategy games. Zero-determinant strategies in iterated prisoner's dilemma can be seen as degenerate case of our results. The results are also applied to the snowdrift game, the hawk-dove game and the chicken game.",0
"Context {Earlier cross-correlation studies for AM Her were performed in various energy range from optical to X-ray and suggested that it mostly shows a high level of correlation but on occasion it shows a low level of correlation or uncorrelation.} Aims {To investigate the degree of correlation between soft (2-4 keV) and hard (9-20 keV) X-rays, we perform the cross-correlation study of the X-ray data sets of AM Her obtained with {\it RXTE}.} Methods {We cross-correlate the background-subtracted soft and hard X-ray light curves using the XRONOS program crosscor and fit a model to the obtained cross-correlation functions.} Results {We detect a hard X-ray lag of $192\pm33$ s in a specific section of energy-dependent light curve, where the soft X-ray (2-4 keV) intensity decreases but the hard X-ray (9-20 keV) intensity increases. From a spectral analysis, we find that the X-ray emission temperature increases during the anti-correlated intensity variation. In two other observations, the cross-correlation functions show a low level of correlation, which is consistent with the earlier results performed in a different energy range.} Conclusions {We report a detection of an anti-correlated hard X-ray lag of $\sim$190 s from the proto-type polar AM Her. The hard X-ray lag is detected for the first time in the given energy range, and it is the longest lag among those reported in magnetic cataclysmic variables. We discuss the implications of our findings regarding the origin of the hard X-ray lag and the anti-correlated intensity variation.}",0
"In the present paper we show how one can calculate the lengths of edges of a minimum spanning tree constructed for a finite metric space, in terms of the Gromov-Hausdorff distances from this space to simplices of sufficiently large diameter. Here by simplices we mean finite metric spaces all of whose nonzero distances are the same. As an application, we reduce the problems of finding a Steiner minimal tree length or a minimal filling length to maximization of the total distance to some finite number of simplices considered as points of the Gromov-Hausdorff space.",0
"Voice is envisioned to be a popular way for humans to interact with Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. We propose a proximity-based user authentication method (called PIANO) for access control on such voice-powered IoT devices. PIANO leverages the built-in speaker, microphone, and Bluetooth that voice-powered IoT devices often already have. Specifically, we assume that a user carries a personal voice-powered device (e.g., smartphone, smartwatch, or smartglass), which serves as the user's identity. When another voice-powered IoT device of the user requires authentication, PIANO estimates the distance between the two devices by playing and detecting certain acoustic signals; PIANO grants access if the estimated distance is no larger than a user-selected threshold. We implemented a proof-of-concept prototype of PIANO. Through theoretical and empirical evaluations, we find that PIANO is secure, reliable, personalizable, and efficient.",0
"We show that there exists a Galois correspondence between subalgebras of an H-comodule algebra A over a base ring R and generalised quotients of a Hopf algebra H if both A and H are flat Mittag--Leffler modules. We also provide new criteria for subalgebras and generalised quotients to be closed elements of the Galois connection constructed. We generalise the Schauenburg theory of admissible objects to this more general context. Then we consider coextensions of H-module coalgebras. We construct a Galois connection for them and we prove that H-Galois coextensions are closed. We apply the results obtained to the Hopf algebra itself and we give a simple proof that there is a bijective correspondence between right ideal coideals of H and its left coideal subalgebras when H is finite dimensional. Furthermore, we formulate a necessary and sufficient condition for a bijective Galois correspondence for A=H. We also consider crossed product algebras.",0
"As is known the repulsion of the volume elements of an uniformly accelerating charge or a charge supported in an uniform gravitational field accounts for the electromagnetic contribution to the charge's inertial and gravitational mass, respectively. This means that the mutual repulsion of the volume elements of the charge produces the resistance to its accelerated motion. Conversely, the effect of electromagnetic attraction of opposite charges enhances the accelerated motion of the charges provided that they have been initially uniformly accelerated or supported in an uniform gravitational field. The significance of this effect is that it constitutes a possibility of altering inertia and gravitation.",0
"We investigate electromechanical properties of two-dimensional MoS$_2$ monolayers in the 1H, 1T, and 1T$^\prime$ structures as a function of charge doping by using density functional theory. We find isotropic elastic moduli in the 1H and 1T structures, while the 1T$^\prime$ structure exhibits an anisotropic elastic modulus. Moreover, the 1T structure is shown to have a negative Poisson's ratio, while Poisson's ratios of the 1H and 1T$^\prime$ are positive. By charge doping, the monolayer MoS$_2$ shows a reversibly strain and work density per cycle ranging from -0.68% to 2.67% and from 4.4 to 36.9 MJ/m$^3$, respectively, making them suitable for applications in electromechanical actuators. Stress generated is also examined in this work and we find that 1T and 1T$^\prime$ MoS$_2$ monolayers relatively have better performance than 1H MoS$_2$ monolayer. We argue that such excellent electromechanical performance originate from the electrical conductivity of the metallic 1T and semimetallic 1T$^\prime$ structures high Young's modulus of about $150-200$ GPa.",0
"For an $n$-dimensional real-valued centered Gaussian random vector $(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$ with any covariance matrix, the following moment product conjecture is proved in this paper \[ \mathbb{E}\prod_{j=1}^nX_j^{2m_j}\geq \prod_{j=1}^n\mathbb{E}X_j^{2m_j}, \] where $m_j\geq1,1\leq j\leq n,$ are any positive integers. Among other important applications, a special case of this conjecture (with $m_j=m,1\leq j\leq n$) would give an affirmative answer to another open problem: real linear polarization constant. The proof is based on a very elegant and elementary approach in which only one component $X_j$ of the random vector is chosen with varying variance.",0

"Motivated by ultra-high-energy cosmic ray physics, we discuss all the possible alternatives to the familiar Lorentz transformations of the momentum and the energy of a particle. Starting from natural physical requirements, we exclude all the possibilities, apart from the ones which arise from the usual four-vector transformations by means of a change of coordinates in the mass-shell. This result confirms the remark, given in a preceding paper, that, in a theory without preferred inertial frames, one can always define a linearly transforming energy parameter to which the GZK cutoff argument can be applied. We also discuss the connections between the conservation and the transformation properties of energy-momentum and the relation between energy-momentum and velocity.",0
"We consider a process on $\mathbb{T}^2$, which consists of fast motion along the stream lines of an incompressible periodic vector field perturbed by white noise. It gives rise to a process on the graph naturally associated to the structure of the stream lines of the unperturbed flow. It has been shown by Freidlin and Wentzell [Random Perturbations of Dynamical Systems, 2nd ed. Springer, New York (1998)] and [Mem. Amer. Math. Soc. 109 (1994)] that if the stream function of the flow is periodic, then the corresponding process on the graph weakly converges to a Markov process. We consider the situation where the stream function is not periodic, and the flow (when considered on the torus) has an ergodic component of positive measure. We show that if the rotation number is Diophantine, then the process on the graph still converges to a Markov process, which spends a positive proportion of time in the vertex corresponding to the ergodic component of the flow.",0
"In the $C^*$-algebraic setting the spectrum of any group-like element of a compact quantum group is shown to be a closed subgroup of the one-dimensional torus. A number of consequences of this fact are then illustrated, along with a loose connection with the so-called Kadison-Kaplansky conjecture.",0
"Nuclear star clusters are among the densest stellar systems known and are common in both early- and late-type galaxies. They exhibit scaling relations with their host galaxy which may be related to those of supermassive black holes. These may therefore help us to unravel the complex physical processes occurring at the centres of galaxies. The properties of nuclear stellar systems suggest that their formation requires both dissipational and dissipationless processes. They have stellar populations of different ages, from stars as old as their host galaxy to young stars formed in the last 100 Myr. Therefore star formation must be happening either directly in the nuclear star cluster or in its vicinity. The secular processes that fuel the formation of pseudobulges very likely also contributes to nuclear star cluster growth.",0
"We present results from a wide-field imaging study of the globular cluster (GC) systems of a sample of edge-on, Sb-Sc spiral galaxies ~7-20 Mpc away. This study is part of a larger survey of the ensemble properties of the GC populations of giant galaxies. We imaged the galaxies in BVR filters with large-format CCD detectors on the WIYN 3.5-m telescope, to projected radii of ~20-40 kpc. For four galaxies (NGC 2683, NGC 3556, NGC 4157, and NGC 7331), we quantify the radial distributions of the GC systems and estimate the total number, luminosity- and mass-normalized specific frequencies (S_N and T), and blue (metal-poor) fraction of GCs. A fifth galaxy (NGC 3044) was apparently too distant for us to have detected its GC system. Our S_N for NGC 2683 is 2.5 times smaller than the previously-published value, likely due in part to reduced contamination from non-GCs. For the spiral galaxies analyzed for the survey to date, the average number of GCs is 170+/-40 and the weighted mean values of S_N and T are 0.8+/-0.2 and 1.4+/-0.3. We use the survey data to derive a relationship between radial exent of the GC system and host galaxy mass over a factor of 20 in mass. Finally, we confirm the trend, identified in previous survey papers, of increasing specific frequency of metal-poor GCs with increasing galaxy mass. We compare the data with predictions from a simple model and show that carefully quantifying the numbers of metal-poor GCs in galaxies can constrain the formation redshifts of the GCs and their host galaxies.",0
"We present an efficient classical algorithm for training deep Boltzmann machines (DBMs) that uses rejection sampling in concert with variational approximations to estimate the gradients of the training objective function. Our algorithm is inspired by a recent quantum algorithm for training DBMs. We obtain rigorous bounds on the errors in the approximate gradients; in turn, we find that choosing the instrumental distribution to minimize the alpha=2 divergence with the Gibbs state minimizes the asymptotic algorithmic complexity. Our rejection sampling approach can yield more accurate gradients than low-order contrastive divergence training and the costs incurred in finding increasingly accurate gradients can be easily parallelized. Finally our algorithm can train full Boltzmann machines and scales more favorably with the number of layers in a DBM than greedy contrastive divergence training.",0
"If $X(t,x)$ is the density of one-dimensional super-Brownian motion, we prove that $\text{dim}(\partial\{x:X(t,x)>0\})=2-2\lambda_0\in(0,1)$ a.s. on $\{X_t\neq 0\}$, where $-\lambda_0\in(-1,-1/2)$ is the lead eigenvalue of a killed Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. This confirms a conjecture of Mueller, Mytnik and Perkins who proved the above with positive probability. To establish this result we derive some new basic properties of a recently introduced boundary local time and analyze the behaviour of $X(t,\cdot)$ near the upper edge of its support. Numerical estimates of $\lambda_0$ suggest that the above Hausdorff dimension is approximately $.224$.",0
"The complex perovskite Pb2CoTeO6 (PCTO) has been prepared as polycrystalline powders by solid state reaction route, and the crystal structure and magnetic properties have been investigated using a combination of X-ray and neutron powder diffraction, electron microscopy, dielectric, calorimetric and magnetic measurements. It was shown that at room temperature this compound adopts a trigonal perovskite structure, space group R-3 (a= 5.6782(1){\AA}, c= 13.8552(3){\AA}). The compound undergoes a number of temperature-induced phase transitions and adopts four different structures in the temperature range 5-500 K: monoclinic in P21/n(5<T<125K, tilt system (a+b-b-)), monoclinic in I2/m (125<T<210 K, tilt system (a0b-b-)), rhombohedral in R-3 (210<T<370K, tilt system (a-a-a-)), and finally cubic in Fm-3m (above 370K without any tilting). These structural phase transitions are coupled to a change in the dielectric constant and the heat capacity around 210 and 370K. A long-range antiferromagnetically ordered state has been identified from neutron powder diffraction and magnetic studies at different temperatures. Magnetic diffraction peaks were registered below the transition at about 16 K and a possible model for the magnetic structure is proposed. Possible coexistence of long-range ordering of electrical dipoles and magnetic moments at low temperatures making PCTO a multiferroic candidate is discussed and compared with those of other Co-based quaternary oxides adopting the perovskite structure.",0

"The old mantra of decentralizing the Internet is coming again with fanfare, this time around the blockchain technology hype. We have already seen a technology supposed to change the nature of the Internet: peer-to-peer. The reality is that peer-to-peer naming systems failed, peer-to-peer social networks failed, and yes, peer-to-peer storage failed as well. In this paper, we will review the research on distributed systems in the last few years to identify the limits of open peer-to-peer networks. We will address issues like system complexity, security and frailty, instability and performance. We will show how many of the aforementioned problems also apply to the recent breed of permissionless blockchain networks. The applicability of such systems to mature industrial applications is undermined by the same properties that make them so interesting for a libertarian audience: namely, their openness, their pseudo-anonymity and their unregulated cryptocurrencies. As such, we argue that permissionless blockchain networks are unsuitable to be the substrate for a decentralized Internet. Yet, there is still hope for more decentralization, albeit in a form somewhat limited with respect to the libertarian view of decentralized Internet: in cooperation rather than in competition with the superpowerful datacenters that dominate the world today. This is derived from the recent surge in interest in byzantine fault tolerance and permissioned blockchains, which opens the door to a world where use of trusted third parties is not the only way to arbitrate an ensemble of entities. The ability of establish trust through permissioned blockchains enables to move the control from the datacenters to the edge, truly realizing the promises of edge-centric computing.",0
"Lattice statistical mechanics, often provides a natural (holonomic) framework to perform singularity analysis with several complex variables that would, in a general mathematical framework, be too complex, or could not be defined. Considering several Picard-Fuchs systems of two-variables """"above"""" Calabi-Yau ODEs, associated with double hypergeometric series, we show that holonomic functions are actually a good framework for actually finding the singular manifolds. We, then, analyse the singular algebraic varieties of the n-fold integrals $ \chi^{(n)}$, corresponding to the decomposition of the magnetic susceptibility of the anisotropic square Ising model. We revisit a set of Nickelian singularities that turns out to be a two-parameter family of elliptic curves. We then find a first set of non-Nickelian singularities for $ \chi^{(3)}$ and $ \chi^{(4)}$, that also turns out to be rational or ellipic curves. We underline the fact that these singular curves depend on the anisotropy of the Ising model. We address, from a birational viewpoint, the emergence of families of elliptic curves, and of Calabi-Yau manifolds on such problems. We discuss the accumulation of these singular curves for the non-holonomic anisotropic full susceptibility.",0
"The main technical result of the paper is a Bochner type formula for the sub-laplacian on a quaternionic contact manifold. With the help of this formula we establish a version of Lichnerowicz' theorem giving a lower bound of the eigenvalues of the sub-Laplacian under a lower bound on the $Sp(n)Sp(1)$ components of the qc-Ricci curvature. It is shown that in the case of a 3-Sasakian manifold the lower bound is reached iff the quaternionic contact manifold is a round 3-Sasakian sphere. Another goal of the paper is to establish a-priori estimates for square integrals of horizontal derivatives of smooth compactly supported functions. As an application, we prove a sharp inequality bounding the horizontal Hessian of a function by its sub-Laplacian on the quaternionic Heisenberg group.",0
"This study presents a simplified approach to studying the dynamics of global texture collapse. We derive equations of motion for a spherically symmetric field configuration using a two parameter ansatz. Then we analyse the effective potential for the resulting theory to understand possible trajectories of the field configuration in the parameter space of the ansatz. Numerical results are given for critical winding and collapse time in spatially flat non-expanding, and flat expanding universes. In addition, the open non-expanding and open-expanding cases are studied.",0
"We study the relation between a certain graded part of the Jacobian ring of a projective hypersurface and a certain graded quotient for the Hodge filtration of its primitive cohomology, in the case that the hypersurface has at most isolated singularities. We distinguish a class of singularities for which this relation is best possible. The main examples refer to the surface case.",0
"The radiation-pressure interaction between one or more laser fields and a mechanical oscillator gives rise to a wide range of phenomena: from sideband cooling and backaction-evading measurements to pondermotive and mechanical squeezing to entanglement and motional sideband asymmetry. In many protocols, such as dissipative mechanical squeezing, multiple lasers are utilized, giving rise to periodically driven optomechanical systems. Here we show that in this case, Floquet dynamics can arise due to presence of Kerr-type nonlinearities, which are ubiqitious in optomechanical systems. Specifically, employing multiple probe tones, we perform sideband asymmetry measurements, a macroscopic quantum effect, on a silicon optomechanical crystal sideband-cooled to 40% ground-state occupation. We show that the Floquet dynamics, resulting from the presence of multiple pump tones, gives rise to an artificially modified motional sideband asymmetry by redistributing thermal and quantum fluctuations among the initially independently scattered thermomechanical sidebands. For pump tones exhibiting large frequency separation, the dynamics is suppressed and accurate quantum noise thermometry demonstrated. We develop a theoretical model based on Floquet theory that accurately describes our observations. The resulting dynamics can be understood as resulting from a synthetic gauge field among the Fourier modes, which is created by the phase lag of the Kerr-type response. This novel phenomenon has wide-ranging implications for schemes utilizing several pumping tones, as commonly employed in backaction-evading measurements, dissipative optical squeezing, dissipative mechanical squeezing and quantum noise thermometry. Our observation may equally well be used for optomechanical Floquet engineering, e.g. generation of topological phases of sound by periodic time-modulation.",0
"In a recent paper, Nagaev cited the unpublished paper by Franck et al.to support his theoretical model for the mechanism of the giant isotope effect observed in La_{1-x}Ca_{x}MnO_{3+y} (x = 0.20, y > 0). His model suggests that the off-stoichiometric oxygen content depends strongly on the oxygen isotope mass, which leads to a giant oxygen-isotope effect. Here I show that his theoretical model is not consistent with any experimental results (even the results recently published by Franck et al.), and his estimate of polaronic bandwidth is wrong due to his misuse of polaronic theories.",0
An effective field theory treatment of nucleon-nucleon scattering at low energy shows much promise and could prove a useful tool in the study of nuclear matter at both ordinary and extreme densities. The analysis is complicated by the existence a large length scale --- the scattering length --- which arises due to couplings in the short distance theory being near critical values. I show how this can be dealt with by introducing an explicit s-channel state in the effective field theory. The procedure is worked out analytically in a toy example. I then demonstrate that a simple effective field theory excellently reproduces the 1S_0 np phase shift up to the pion production threshold.,0
"The evolution in the surface morphology of epitaxial graphene films and 6H-SiC(0001) substrates is studied by electron channeling contrast imaging. Whereas film thickness is determined by growth temperature only, increasing growth times at constant temperature affect both internal stress and film morphology. Annealing times in excess of 8-10 minutes lead to an increase in the mean square roughness of SiC step edges to which graphene films are pinned, resulting in compressively stressed films at room temperature. Shorter annealing times produce minimal changes in the morphology of the terrace edges and result in nearly stress-free films upon cooling to room temperature.",0
"We theoretically study graphene nanoribbons in the presence of spatially varying magnetic fields produced e.g. by nanomagnets. We show both analytically and numerically that an exceptionally large Rashba spin orbit interaction (SOI) of the order of 10 meV can be produced by the non-uniform magnetic field. As a consequence, helical modes exist in armchair nanoribbons that exhibit nearly perfect spin polarization and are robust against boundary defects. This paves the way to realizing spin filter devices in graphene nanoribbons in the temperature regime of a few Kelvins. If a nanoribbon in the helical regime is in proximity contact to an s-wave superconductor, the nanoribbon can be tuned into a topological phase sustaining Majorana fermions.",0
"An expression for the coefficients of a linear iterative equation in terms of the parameters of the source equation is given both for equations in standard form and for equations in reduced normal form.

In particular, a simple necessary and sufficient condition for an equation to be iterative is given for the general fourth-order linear equation solely in terms of its coefficients.",0
"We consider the Potts model in a magnetic field on an arbitrary graph $G$. Using a formula of F. Y. Wu for the partition function $Z$ of this model as a sum over spanning subgraphs of $G$, we prove some properties of $Z$ concerning factorization, monotonicity, and zeros. A generalization of the Tutte polynomial is presented that corresponds to this partition function. In this context we formulate and discuss two weighted graph-coloring problems. We also give a general structural result for $Z$ for cyclic strip graphs.",0
We construct exact pp-wave solutions of ghost-free infinite derivative gravity. These waves described in the Kerr-Schild form also solve the linearized field equations of the theory. We also find an exact gravitational shock wave with non-singular curvature invariants and with a finite limit in the ultraviolet regime of non-locality which is in contrast to the divergent limit in Einstein's theory.,0
"We consider GL$_m$-dimers of triangulations of regular convex $n$-gons, which give rise to a dimer model with boundary $Q$ and a dimer algebra $\Lambda_Q$. Let $e_b$ be the sum of the idempotents of all the boundary vertices, and $\mathcal{B}_Q:= e_b \Lambda_Q e_b$ the associated boundary algebra. In this article we show that given two different triangulations $T_1$ and $T_2$ of the $n$-gon, the boundary algebras are isomorphic, i.e. $e_b \Lambda_{Q_{T_1}} e_b \cong e_b \Lambda_{Q_{T_2}} e_b$.",0

"The classical boundary-value problem of the Einstein field equations is studied with an arbitrary cosmological constant, in the case of a compact ($S^{3}$) boundary given a biaxial Bianchi-IX positive-definite three-metric, specified by two radii $(a,b).$ For the simplest, four-ball, topology of the manifold with this boundary, the regular classical solutions are found within the family of Taub-NUT-(anti)de Sitter metrics with self-dual Weyl curvature. For arbitrary choice of positive radii $(a,b),$ we find that there are three solutions for the infilling geometry of this type. We obtain exact solutions for them and for their Euclidean actions. The case of negative cosmological constant is investigated further. For reasonable squashing of the three-sphere, all three infilling solutions have real-valued actions which possess a ``cusp catastrophe'' structure with a non-self-intersecting ``catastrophe manifold'' implying that the dominant contribution comes from the unique real positive-definite solution on the ball. The positive-definite solution exists even for larger deformations of the three-sphere, as long as a certain inequality between $a$ and $b$ holds. The action of this solution is proportional to $-a^{3}$ for large $a (\sim b)$ and hence larger radii are favoured. The same boundary-value problem with more complicated interior topology containing a ``bolt'' is investigated in a forthcoming paper.",0
"A search for a new scalar resonance decaying to a pair of Z bosons is performed in the mass range from 130 GeV to 3 TeV, and for various width scenarios. The analysis is based on proton-proton collisions recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb$^{-1}$ at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The Z boson pair decays are reconstructed using the 4$\ell$, 2$\ell$2q, and 2$\ell$2$\nu$ final states, where $\ell =$ e or $\mu$. Both gluon fusion and electroweak production of the scalar resonance are considered, with a free parameter describing their relative cross sections. A dedicated categorization of events, based on the kinematic properties of associated jets, and matrix element techniques are employed for an optimal signal and background separation. A description of the interference between signal and background amplitudes for a resonance of an arbitrary width is included. No significant excess of events with respect to the standard model expectation is observed and limits are set on the product of the cross section for a new scalar boson and the branching fraction for its decay to ZZ for a large range of masses and widths.",0
"In this paper, we propose a novel ranking framework for collaborative filtering with the overall aim of learning user preferences over items by minimizing a pairwise ranking loss. We show the minimization problem involves dependent random variables and provide a theoretical analysis by proving the consistency of the empirical risk minimization in the worst case where all users choose a minimal number of positive and negative items. We further derive a Neural-Network model that jointly learns a new representation of users and items in an embedded space as well as the preference relation of users over the pairs of items. The learning objective is based on three scenarios of ranking losses that control the ability of the model to maintain the ordering over the items induced from the users' preferences, as well as, the capacity of the dot-product defined in the learned embedded space to produce the ordering. The proposed model is by nature suitable for implicit feedback and involves the estimation of only very few parameters. Through extensive experiments on several real-world benchmarks on implicit data, we show the interest of learning the preference and the embedding simultaneously when compared to learning those separately. We also demonstrate that our approach is very competitive with the best state-of-the-art collaborative filtering techniques proposed for implicit feedback.",0
"This paper presents an efficient 51 lines Matlab code to solve topology optimization problems. By the fact that the presented code is based on an hard 0-1 optimization method that handles the integer part of the optimization in a simple fashion and in sub-polynomial time, it has been possible to not only reduce the number of lines to 51 without sacrificing any readability, but also to obtain void-solid designs with close to none checkerboard patterns with improved efficiency. The numerical results in the paper show that the proposed method has the best average times compared to several codes available in literature. We also present extensions to different boundary conditions and to three dimensional designs. The code can be used by students and the newcomers in topology optimization because of its simplicity and readability.

"Objective: Hydrocephalus is a medical condition in which there is an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain. Segmentation of brain imagery into brain tissue and CSF (before and after surgery, i.e. pre-op vs. postop) plays a crucial role in evaluating surgical treatment. Segmentation of pre-op images is often a relatively straightforward problem and has been well researched. However, segmenting post-operative (post-op) computational tomographic (CT)-scans becomes more challenging due to distorted anatomy and subdural hematoma collections pressing on the brain. Most intensity and feature based segmentation methods fail to separate subdurals from brain and CSF as subdural geometry varies greatly across different patients and their intensity varies with time. We combat this problem by a learning approach that treats segmentation as supervised classification at the pixel level, i.e. a training set of CT scans with labeled pixel identities is employed. Methods: Our contributions include: 1.) a dictionary learning framework that learns class (segment) specific dictionaries that can efficiently represent test samples from the same class while poorly represent corresponding samples from other classes, 2.) quantification of associated computation and memory footprint, and 3.) a customized training and test procedure for segmenting post-op hydrocephalic CT images. Results: Experiments performed on infant CT brain images acquired from the CURE Children's Hospital of Uganda reveal the success of our method against the state-of-the-art alternatives. We also demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is computationally less burdensome and exhibits a graceful degradation against number of training samples, enhancing its deployment potential.",0
"We study the fluid inclusion of both Lennard-Jones particles and particles with competing interaction ranges --short range attractive and long range repulsive (SALR)-- in a disordered porous medium constructed as a controlled pore glass in two dimensions. With the aid of a full two-dimensional Ornstein-Zernike approach, complemented by a Replica Ornstein-Zernike integral equation, we explicitly obtain the spatial density distribution of the fluid adsorbed in the porous matrix and a good approximation for the average fluid-matrix correlations. The results illustrate the remarkable differences between the adsorbed Lennard-Jones (LJ) and SALR systems. In the latter instance, particles tend to aggregate in clusters which occupy pockets and bays in the porous structure, whereas the LJ fluid uniformly wets the porous walls. A comparison with Molecular Dynamics simulations shows that the two-dimensional Ornstein-Zernike approach with a Hypernetted Chain closure together with a sensible approximation for the fluid-fluid correlations can provide an accurate picture of the spatial distribution of adsorbed fluids for a given configuration of porous material.",0
"Previous studies suggest that the planet-forming disks around very-low-mass stars/brown dwarfs may be flatter than those around more massive stars, in contrast to model predictions of larger scale heights for gas-disks around lower-mass stars. We conducted a statistically robust study to determine whether there is evidence for stellar-mass-dependent disk structure in planet-forming disks. We find a statistically significant difference in the Spitzer/IRAC color distributions of disks around very-low-mass and low-mass stars all belonging to the same star-forming region, the Chamaeleon I star-forming region. We show that self consistently calculated disk models cannot fit the median spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the two groups. These SEDs can be only explained by flatter disk models, consistent with the effect of dust settling in disks. We find that relative to the disk structure predicted for flared disks the required reduction in disk scale height is anti-correlated with the stellar mass, i.e. disks around lower-mass stars are flatter. Our results show that the initial and boundary conditions of planet formation are stellar-mass-dependent, an important finding that must be considered in planet formation models.",0

"Transparent and conductive ZnO:Ga thin films are prepared by laser molecular-beam epitaxy. Their electron properties were investigated by the temperature-dependent Hall-effect technique. The 300-K carrier concentration and mobility were about $n_s \sim 10^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$ and 440 cm$^{2}$/Vs, respectively. In the experimental `mobility vs concentration' curve, unusual phenomenon was observed, i.e., mobilities at $n_s \sim 5\times$ 10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$ are significantly smaller than those at higher densities above $\sim 10^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$. Several types of scattering centers including ionized donors and oxygen traps are considered to account for the observed dependence of the Hall mobility on carrier concentration. The scattering mechanism is explained in terms of inter-grain potential barriers and charged impurities. A comparison between theoretical results and experimental data is made.",0
"The notion that microparsec-scale black holes can be used to probe gigaparsec-scale physics may seem counterintuitive, at first. Yet, the gravitational observatory LISA will detect cosmologically-distant coalescing pairs of massive black holes, accurately measure their luminosity distance and help identify an electromagnetic counterpart or a host galaxy. A wide variety of new black hole studies and a gravitational version of Hubble's diagram become possible if host galaxies are successfully identified. Furthermore, if dark energy is a manifestation of large-scale modified gravity, deviations from general relativistic expectations could become apparent in a gravitational signal propagated over cosmological scales, especially when compared to the electromagnetic signal from a same source. Finally, since inspirals of white dwarfs into massive black holes at cosmological distances may permit pre-merger localizations, we suggest that careful monitoring of these events and any associated electromagnetic counterpart could lead to high-precision cosmological measurements with LISA.",0

"Cygnus X-1 was the first X-ray source widely accepted to be a black hole candidate and remains among the most studied astronomical objects in its class. The detection of non-thermal radio, hard X-rays and gamma rays reveals the fact that this kind of objects are capable of accelerating particles up to very high energies. In order to explain the electromagnetic emission from Cygnus X-1 in the low-hard state we present a model of a black hole corona with both relativistic lepton and hadron content. We characterize the corona as a two-temperature hot plasma plus a mixed non-thermal population in which energetic particles interact with magnetic, photon and matter fields. Our calculations include the radiation emitted by secondary particles (pions, muons and electron/positron pairs). Finally, we take into account the effects of photon absorption. We compare the results obtained from our model with data of Cygnus X-1 obtained by the COMPTEL instrument.",0
"It is widely believed that the adoption behavior of a decision-maker in a social network is related to the number of signals it receives from its peers in the social network. It is unclear if these same principles hold when the """"pattern"""" by which they receive these signals vary and when potential decisions have different utilities. To investigate that, we manipulate social signal exposure in an online controlled experiment with human participants. Specifically, we change the number of signals and the pattern through which participants receive them over time. We analyze its effect through a controlled game where each participant makes a decision to select one option when presented with six choices with differing utilities, with one choice having the most utility. We avoided network effects by holding the neighborhood network of the users constant. Over multiple rounds of the game, we observe the following: (1) even in the presence of monetary risks and previously acquired knowledge of the six choices, decision-makers tend to deviate from the obvious optimal decision when their peers make similar choices, (2) when the quantity of social signals vary over time, the probability that a participant selects the decision similar to the one reflected by the social signals and therefore being responsive to social influence does not necessarily correlate proportionally to the absolute quantity of signals and (3) an early subjugation to higher quantity of peer social signals turned out to be a more effective strategy of social influence when aggregated over the rounds.",0
In this paper the dependence of wealth distribution and the velocity of money on the required reserve ratio is examined based on a random transfer model of money and computer simulations. A fractional reserve banking system is introduced to the model where money creation can be achieved by bank loans and the monetary aggregate is determined by the monetary base and the required reserve ratio. It is shown that monetary wealth follows asymmetric Laplace distribution and latency time of money follows exponential distribution. The expression of monetary wealth distribution and that of the velocity of money in terms of the required reserve ratio are presented in a good agreement with simulation results.,0
We provide a theoretical framework for the prediction and interpretation of momentum dependent phonon spectra due to coherent inelastic scattering of electrons. We complete the approach with first principles lattice dynamics using periodic density functional theory and compare to recent electron energy loss measurements on cubic and hexagonal boron nitride performed within a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM). The combination of theory and experiment provides the ability to interpret momentum dependent phonon spectra obtained at nanometer spatial resolution in the electron microscope.,0
"Activation barriers associated with ion diffusion and chemical reactions are vital to understand and predict a wide range of phenomena, such as material growth, ion transport, and catalysis. In the calculation of activation barriers for non-redox processes in semiconductors and insulators, it has been widely assumed that the charge state remains fixed to that of the initial electronic ground state throughout a dynamical process. In this work, we demonstrate that this assumption is generally inaccurate and that a rate-limiting transition state can have a different charge state from the initial ground state. This phenomenon can significantly lower the activation barrier of dynamical process that depends strongly on charge state, such as carbon vacancy diffusion in 4H-SiC. With inclusion of such transition state redox, the activation barrier varies continuously with Fermi level, in contrast to the step-line feature predicted by the traditional fixed-charge assumption. In this study, a straightforward approach to include the transition state redox effect is provided, the typical situations where the effect plays a significant role are identified, and the relevant electron dynamics are discussed.",0
"Isotope ratios of fragments produced at mid-rapidity in peripheral and central collisions of 114Cd ions with 92Mo and 98Mo target nuclei at E/A = 50 MeV are compared. Neutron-rich isotopes are preferentially produced in central collisions as compared to peripheral collisions. The influence of the size (A), density, N/Z, E*/A, and Eflow/A of the emitting source on the measured isotope ratios was explored by comparison with a statistical model (SMM). The mid-rapidity region associated with peripheral collisions does not appear to be neutron-enriched relative to central collisions.",0
"We discuss some applications of WQOs to several fields were hierarchies and reducibilities are the principal classification tools, notably to Descriptive Set Theory, Computability theory and Automata Theory.

We survey some results obtained so far and discuss open problems and possible research directions.",0

"The cosmological power spectrum of the coherent matter flow is measured exploiting an improved prescription for the apparent anisotropic clustering pattern in redshift space. New statistical analysis is presented to provide an optimal observational platform to link the improved redshift distortion theoretical model to future real datasets. The statistical power as well as robustness of our method are tested against 60 realizations of 8 Gpc/h^3 dark matter simulation maps mocking the precision level of upcoming wide--deep surveys. We showed that we can accurately extract the velocity power spectrum up to quasi linear scales of k~0.1 h/Mpc at z = 0.35 and up to k~0.15 h/Mpc at higher redshifts within a couple of percentage precision level. Our understanding of redshift space distortion is proved to be appropriate for precision cosmology, and our statistical method will guide us to righteous path to meet the real world.",0
"Econophysics and econometrics agree that there is a correlation between volume and volatility in a time series. Using empirical data and their distributions, we further investigate this correlation and discover new ways that volatility and volume interact, particularly when the levels of both are high. We find that the distribution of the volume-conditional volatility is well fit by a power-law function with an exponential cutoff. We find that the volume-conditional volatility distribution scales with volume, and collapses these distributions to a single curve. We exploit the characteristics of the volume-volatility scatter plot to find a strong correlation between logarithmic volume and a quantity we define as local maximum volatility (LMV), which indicates the largest volatility observed in a given range of trading volumes. This finding supports our empirical analysis showing that volume is an excellent predictor of the maximum value of volatility for both same-day and near-future time periods. We also use a joint conditional probability that includes both volatility and volume to demonstrate that invoking both allows us to better predict the largest next-day volatility than invoking either one alone.",0
"Horn's problem asks for the conditions on sets of integers mu, nu and lambda that ensure the existence of Hermitian operators A, B and A+B with spectra mu, nu and lambda, respectively. It has been shown that this problem is equivalent to deciding whether the irreducible representation of GL(d) with highest weight lambda is contained in the tensor product of irreducible representations with highest weight mu and nu. In this paper we present a quantum information-theoretic proof of the relation between the two problems that is asymptotic in one direction. This result has previously been obtained by Klyachko using geometric invariant theory. The work presented in this paper does not, however, touch upon the non-asymptotic equivalence between the two problems, a result that rests on the recently proven saturation conjecture for GL(d).",0
"The atomic structure, mechanical and thermodynamic stability of vacancy clusters in Cu are studied by atomistic simulations. The most stable atomic configuration of small vacancy clusters is determined. The mechanical stability of the vacancy clusters is examined by applying uniaxial and volumetric tensile strain to the system. The yield stress and yield strain of the system are significantly reduced comparing to the prefect lattice. The dependence of vacancy formation and binding energy as a function of strain is explored and can be understood from the liquid-drop model. We find that the formation energy of the vacancy clusters decreases monotonically as a function of the uniaxial strain, while the formation energy increases first then decreases under the volumetric tensile strain. The thermodynamic stability of the vacancy clusters is analyzed by calculating the Gibbs free binding energy and the total probability of dissociation of the vacancy clusters at 300 K and 900 K under uniaxial and volumetric strains. We find that although most of the vacancy clusters appear to be thermodynamically stable, some of the immediate sized clusters have high probability of dissociation into smaller clusters.",0
"Thermal neutron detector based on films of $^{10}$B$_4$C have been developed as an alternative to $^3$He detectors. In particular, The Multi-Grid detector concept is considered for future large area detectors for ESS and ILL instruments. An excellent signal-to-background ratio is essential to attain expected scientific results. Aluminium is the most natural material for the mechanical structure of of the Multi-Grid detector and other similar concepts due to its mechanical and neutronic properties. Due to natural concentration of $\alpha$ emitters, however, the background from $\alpha$ particles misidentified as neutrons can be unacceptably high. We present our experience operating a detector prototype affected by this issue. Monte Carlo simulations have been used to confirm the background as $\alpha$ particles. The issues have been addressed in the more recent implementations of the Multi-Grid detector by the use of purified aluminium as well as Ni-plating of standard aluminium. The result is the reduction in background by two orders of magnitude. A new large-area prototype has been built incorporating these modifications.",0
"We show unusual cooperative two-photon resonance between two-modes of field inside a photonic crystal cavity. The two-photon resonance occurs when two off resonant quantum dots emit one photon in each cavity mode and de-excite simultaneously. In the presence of phonon coupling the conditions for two-photon resonance change significantly. Using such two-photon two-mode interaction we propose to generate entangled state of two qutrits. The basis of a qutrit are formed by the state of the cavity mode containing $0$, $1$ and $2$ photons. We also discuss effect of phonon coupling on negativity of the generated entangled state.",0
"Feature selection is frequently used as a pre-processing step to machine learning. It is a process of choosing a subset of original features so that the feature space is optimally reduced according to a certain evaluation criterion. The central objective of this paper is to reduce the dimension of the data by finding a small set of important features which can give good classification performance. We have applied filter and wrapper approach with different classifiers QDA and LDA respectively. A widely-used filter method is used for bioinformatics data i.e. a univariate criterion separately on each feature, assuming that there is no interaction between features and then applied Sequential Feature Selection method. Experimental results show that filter approach gives better performance in respect of Misclassification Error Rate.",0
"Including the Haar measure we show that the effective potential of the regularized SU(2) Yang-Mills theory has a minimum at vanishing Wilson-line $W=0$ for strong coupling, whereas it develops two degenerate minima close to $W=\pm 1$ for weak coupling. This suggests that the non-abelian character of $SU(2)$ as contained in the Haar measure might be responsible for confinement.",0
"After G. N. Lewis (1875-1946) proposed the term """"photon"""" in 1926, many physicists adopted it as a more apt name for Einstein's light quantum. However, Lewis' photon was a concept of a very different kind, something few physicists knew or cared about. It turns out that Lewis' name was not quite the neologism that it has usually been assumed to be. The same name was proposed or used earlier, apparently independently, by at least four scientists. Three of the four early proposals were related to physiology or visual perception, and only one to quantum physics. Priority belongs to the American physicist and psychologist L. T. Troland (1889-1932), who coined the word in 1916, and five years later it was independently introduced by the Irish physicist J. Joly (1857-1933). Then in 1925 a French physiologist, Rene Wurmser (1890-1993), wrote about the photon, and in July 1926 his compatriot, the physicist F. Wolfers (ca. 1890-1971), did the same in the context of optical physics. None of the four pre-Lewis versions of """"photon"""" was well known and they were soon forgotten.",0
"We construct self-consistent dynamical models for disk galaxies with triaxial, cuspy halos. We begin with an equilibrium, axisymmetric, disk-bulge-halo system and apply an artificial acceleration to the halo particles. By design, this acceleration conserves energy and thereby preserving the system's differential energy distribution even as its phase space distribution function is altered. The halo becomes triaxial but its spherically-averaged density profile remains largely unchanged. The final system is in equilibrium, to a very good approximation, so long as the halo's shape changes adiabatically. The disk and bulge are ``live'' while the halo is being deformed; they respond to the changing gravitational potential but also influence the deformation of the halo. We test the hypothesis that halo triaxiality can explain the rotation curves of low surface brightness galaxies by modelling the galaxy F568-3.",0
"Many works on inverse problems in the imaging sciences consider regularization via one or more penalty functions or constraint sets. When the models/images are not easily described using one or a few penalty functions/constraints, additive model descriptions for regularization lead to better imaging results. These include cartoon-texture decomposition, morphological component analysis, and robust principal component analysis; methods that typically rely on penalty functions. We propose a regularization framework, based on the Minkowski set, that merges the strengths of additive models and constrained formulations. We generalize the Minkowski set, such that the model parameters are the sum of two components, each of which is constrained to an intersection of sets. Furthermore, the sum of the components is also an element of another intersection of sets. These generalizations allow us to include multiple pieces of prior knowledge on each of the components, as well as on the sum of components, which is necessary to ensure physical feasibility of partial-differential-equation based parameters estimation problems. We derive the projection operation onto the generalized Minkowski sets and construct an algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers. We illustrate how we benefit from using more prior knowledge in the form of the generalized Minkowski set using seismic waveform inversion and video background-anomaly separation.",0
"We have measured the present accretion rate of roughly 800 low-mass (~1-1.4 Mo) pre-Main Sequence stars in the field of Supernova 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC, Z~0.3 Zo). It is the first time that this fundamental parameter for star formation is determined for low-mass stars outside our Galaxy. The Balmer continuum emission used to derive the accretion rate positively correlates with the Halpha excess. Both these phenomena are believed to originate from accretion from a circumstellar disk so that their simultaneous detection provides an important confirmation of the pre-Main Sequence nature of the Halpha and UV excess objects, which are likely to be the LMC equivalent of Galactic Classical TTauri stars. The stars with statistically significant excesses are measured to have accretion rates larger than 1.5x10^{-8}Mo/yr at an age of 12-16 Myrs. For comparison, the time scale for disk dissipation observed in the Galaxy is of the order of 6 Myrs. Moreover, the oldest Classical TTauri star known in the Milky Way (TW Hydrae, with 10 Myrs of age) has a measured accretion rate of only 5x10^{-10} Mo/yr, ie 30 times less than what we measure for stars at a comparable age in the LMC. Our findings indicate that metallicity plays a major role in regulating the formation of low-mass stars.",0
"This paper outlines an optimization framework for choosing fast and reliable control actions in a transmission grid emergency situation. We consider contractual load shedding and generation re-dispatch as exemplary emergency actions. To achieve computational efficiency and scalability, this novel formulation of the robust corrective action optimization is stated in terms of voltages and currents, as opposed to standard formulation in terms of power flows and voltages. The current-voltage formulation is natural for expressing voltage and thermal transmission line constraints, and its major advantage is in the linearity of the power flow equations. The complexity of the current-voltage formulation, which is mainly related to the transformation of voltages and currents into active and reactive power injections, can be largely avoided by stating the cost function directly in terms of currents and using linearized or robust estimates for load and generation constraints. The paper considers five different optimization problem formulations, including the full current-voltage formulation, as well as two convex and two linear approximation to the problem. In a case study on an illustrative case study for the IEEE RTS96 system, we demonstrate pros and cons of the different formulations based on simulations for both normal and contingency operation.",0
"On the surface of a rapidly rotating neutron star, the effective centrifugal force decreases the effective acceleration due to gravity (as measured in the rotating frame) at the equator while increasing the acceleration at the poles due to the centrifugal flattening of the star into an oblate spheroid. We compute the effective gravitational acceleration for relativistic rapidly rotating neutron stars and show that for a star with mass $M$, equatorial radius $R_e$, and angular velocity $\Omega$, the deviations of the effective acceleration due to gravity from the nonrotating case take on a universal form that depends only on the compactness ratio $M/R_e$, the dimensionless square of the angular velocity $\Omega^2R_e^3/GM$, and the latitude on the star's surface. This dependence is universal, in that it has very little dependence on the neutron star's equation of state. The effective gravity is expanded in the slow rotation limit to show the dependence on the effective centrifugal force, oblate shape of the star and the quadrupole moment of the gravitational field. In addition, an empirical fit and simple formula for the effective gravity is found. We find that the increase in the acceleration due to gravity at the poles is of the same order of magnitude as the decrease in the effective acceleration due to gravity at the equator for all realistic value of mass, radius and spin. For neutron stars that spin with frequencies near 600 Hz the difference between the effective gravity at the poles and the equator is about 20%.",0
"The structural coefficient of restitution describes the kinetic energy dissipation upon low-velocity (~0.1 m/s) impact of a small asteroid lander, MASCOT, against a hard, ideally elastic plane surface. It is a crucial worst-case input for mission analysis for landing MACOT on a 1km asteroid in 2018. We conducted pendulum tests and describe their analysis and the results.",0
"A classification of the maximally extended solutions for 1+1 gravity models (comprising e.g. generalized dilaton gravity as well as models with non-trivial torsion) is presented. No restrictions are placed on the topology of the arising solutions, and indeed it is found that for generic models solutions on non-compact surfaces of arbitrary genus with an arbitrary non-zero number of holes can be obtained. The moduli space of classical solutions (solutions of the field equations with fixed topology modulo gauge transformations) is parametrized explicitly.",0

"We call complex quasifold of dimension k a space that is locally isomorphic to the quotient of an open subset of the space C^k by the holomorphic action of a discrete group; the analogue of a complex torus in this setting is called a complex quasitorus. We associate to each simple polytope, rational or not, a family of complex quasifolds having same dimension as the polytope, each containing a dense open orbit for the action of a suitable complex quasitorus. We show that each of these spaces M is diffeomorphic to one of the symplectic quasifolds defined in http://arXiv.org/abs/math:SG/9904179, and that the induced symplectic structure is compatible with the complex one, thus defining on M the structure of a Kaehler quasifold. These spaces may be viewed as a generalization of the toric varieties that are usually associated to those simple convex polytopes that are rational.",0

A Higgs boson within the mass range $M_H=140-190$ GeV can be discovered at a photon collider in the reaction $\gamma\gamma\to WW$ (with real or virtual W) with the luminosity integral about 1 fb$^{-1}$. The reasonable resolution in the effective mass of the WW system is required.,0
"We present a study of the effect of charm quarks on the QCD equation of state using partially-quenched p4 charm quarks on a dynamically generated 2+1 flavor background, at zero chemical potential. We show preliminary results for the charm quark contribution to the energy density and pressure in the high temperature region ($T_c < T < 4 T_c$) and compare it to the free-field calculation. The charm quark mass is determined by measuring the charmonium spectrum.",0
"It is generally believed that sunspots are the emergent part of magnetic flux tubes in the solar interior. These tubes are created at the base of the convection zone and rise to the surface due to their magnetic buoyancy. The motion of plasma in the convection zone being highly turbulent, the surface manifestation of sunspots may retain the signature of this turbulence, including its intermittency. From direct observations of sunspots, and indirect observations of the concentration of cosmogenic isotopes $^{14}$C in tree rings or $^{10}$Be in polar ice, power spectral densities in frequency are plotted. Two different frequency scalings emerge, depending on whether the Sun is quiescent or active. %magnetic activity is maximum or minimum. From direct observations we can also calculate scaling exponents. These testify to a strong intermittency, comparable with that observed in the solar wind.",0
"We investigate the skyrmion formation process in nano-structured FeGe Hall-bar devices by measurements of topological Hall effect, which extracts the winding number of a spin texture as an emergent magnetic field. Step-wise profiles of topological Hall resistivity are observed in the course of varying the applied magnetic field, which arise from instantaneous changes in the magnetic nano-structure such as creation, annihilation, and jittering motion of skyrmions. The discrete changes in topological Hall resistivity demonstrate the quantized nature of emergent magnetic flux inherent in each skyrmion, which had been indistinguishable in many-skyrmion systems on a macroscopic scale.",0
"We propose that condensed matter phenomena involving the spontaneous emergence and dynamics of crystal lattices can be realized in the setting of ultracold Bose-condensed atoms coupled to multimode cavities. Previously, it was shown that in the case of a transversely pumped single-mode cavity, the atoms self-organize at either the even or the odd antinodes of the cavity mode, given sufficient pump intensity, and hence spontaneously break a discrete translational symmetry. Here, we demonstrate that in multimode cavities the self-organization brings the additional feature of continuous translational symmetry breaking, via a variant of Brazovskii's transition, thus paving the way for realizations of compliant lattices and associated phenomena, e.g., quantum melting, topological defects, frustration, glassiness, and even supersolidity; such phenomena are absent in ultracold atomic systems when the optical lattices are externally imposed. We apply a functional integral approach to this many-body cavity QED system, which enables us, inter alia, to calculate transition thresholds, explore fluctuations near this transition, and determine how such fluctuations are manifest in the light emitted from the cavity.",0
"We use Quantum Monte Carlo simulations and exact diagonalization to explore the phase diagram of the Bose-Hubbard model with an additional superlattice potential. We first analyze the properties of superfluid and insulating phases present in the hard-core limit where an exact analytic treatment is possible via the Jordan-Wigner transformation. The extension to finite on-site interaction is achieved by means of quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We determine insulator/superfluid phase diagrams as functions of the on-site repulsive interaction, superlattice potential strength, and filling, finding that insulators with fractional occupation numbers, which are present in the hard-core case, extend deep into the soft-core region. Furthermore, at integer fillings, we find that the competition between the on-site repulsion and the superlattice potential can produce a phase transition between a Mott insulator and a charge density wave insulator, with an intermediate superfluid phase. Our results are relevant to the behavior of ultracold atoms in optical superlattices which are beginning to be studied experimentally.",0
"Dynamical modelling lies at the heart of our understanding of physical systems. Its role in science is deeper than mere operational forecasting, in that it allows us to evaluate the adequacy of the mathematical structure of our models. Despite the importance of model parameters, there is no general method of parameter estimation outside linear systems. A new relatively simple method of parameter estimation for nonlinear systems is presented, based on variations in the accuracy of probability forecasts. It is illustrated on the Logistic Map, the Henon Map and the 12-D Lorenz96 flow, and its ability to outperform linear least squares in these systems is explored at various noise levels and sampling rates. As expected, it is more effective when the forecast error distributions are non-Gaussian. The new method selects parameter values by minimizing a proper, local skill score for continuous probability forecasts as a function of the parameter values. This new approach is easier to implement in practice than alternative nonlinear methods based on the geometry of attractors or the ability of the model to shadow the observations. New direct measures of inadequacy in the model, the """"Implied Ignorance"""" and the information deficit are introduced.",0
In this paper we explore the possibility of detecting strongly decaying exotic states. The dibaryon(2.15) $J^P$ = $2^+$ state which decays into d $\pi$ is the example we use in this report.,0
"The bridge index and superbridge index of a knot are important invariants in knot theory. We define the bridge map of a knot conformation, which is closely related to these two invariants, and interpret it in terms of the tangent indicatrix of the knot conformation. Using the concepts of dual and derivative curves of spherical curves as introduced by Arnold, we show that the graph of the bridge map is the union of the binormal indicatrix, its antipodal curve, and some number of great circles. Similarly, we define the inflection map of a knot conformation, interpret it in terms of the binormal indicatrix, and express its graph in terms of the tangent indicatrix. This duality relationship is also studied for another dual pair of curves, the normal and Darboux indicatrices of a knot conformation. The analogous concepts are defined and results are derived for stick knots.",0
"In this paper we present a methodology to adress the problem of brain tissue deformation referred to as """"brainshift"""". This deformation occurs throughout a neurosurgery intervention and strongly alters the accuracy of the neuronavigation systems used to date in clinical routine which rely solely on preoperative patient imaging to locate the surgical target, such as a tumour or a functional area. After a general description of the framework of our intraoperative image-guided system, we propose a biomechanical model of the brain which can take into account interactively such deformations as well as surgical procedures that modify the brain structure, like tumour or tissue resection.",0
We present a mean-field approach for accurately describing strong correlations via electron number fluctuations and pairings constrained to an active space. Electron number conservation is broken and correct only on average but both spin and spatial symmetries are preserved. Optimized natural orbitals and occupations are determined by diagonalization of a mean-field Hamiltonian. This constrained-pairing mean-field theory (CPMFT) yields a two-particle density matrix ansatz that exclusively describe strong correlations. We demonstrate CPMFT accuracy with applications to the metal-insulator transition of large hydrogen clusters and molecular dissociation curves.,0

"We give necessary and sufficient geometric conditions for a distribution (or a Pfaffian system) to be locally equivalent to the canonical contact system on Jn(R,Rm), the space of n-jets of maps from R into Rm. We study the geometry of that class of systems, in particular, the existence of corank one involutive subdistributions. We also distinguish regular points, at which the system is equivalent to the canonical contact system, and singular points, at which we propose a new normal form that generalizes the canonical contact system on Jn(R,Rm) in a way analogous to that how Kumpera-Ruiz normal form generalizes the canonical contact system on Jn(R,R), which is also called Goursat normal form.",0
"Novel mechanisms of defect annealing in solids are discussed, which are based on the large amplitude anharmonic lattice vibrations, a.k.a. intrinsic localized modes or discrete breathers (DBs). A model for amplification of defect annealing rate in Ge by low energy plasma-generated DBs is proposed, in which, based on recent atomistic modelling, it is assumed that DBs can excite atoms around defects rather strongly, giving them energy $\gg k_BT$ for $\sim$100 oscillation periods. This is shown to result in the amplification of the annealing rates proportional to the DB flux, i.e. to the flux of ions (or energetic atoms) impinging at the Ge surface from inductively coupled plasma (ICP)",0
"It is shown that a simple Dirichlet process mixture of multivariate normals offers Bayesian density estimation with adaptive posterior convergence rates. Toward this, a novel sieve for non-parametric mixture densities is explored, and its rate adaptability to various smoothness classes of densities in arbitrary dimension is demonstrated. This sieve construction is expected to offer a substantial technical advancement in studying Bayesian non-parametric mixture models based on stick-breaking priors.",0
"The real-time operator formalism for thermal quantum field theories, thermofield dynamics, is formulated in terms of a path-integral approach in non-commutative spaces.

The effect of temperature and the non-commutative parameter, competing with one another, is analyzed.",0
"We propose a scenario that involves a stationary observer who detects a point like source of light moving with constant velocity at a constant altitude, using a telescope and a frequency-meter. We derive a formula for the angular velocity at which we should rotate the axis of the telescope and a formula that relates the proper period at which the source emits successive wave crests and the proper period at which the stationary observer receives them",0
"Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) and Narrow-Line quasars (NLQs) seem to amount to ~ 10-30 % of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the local universe. Together with their average accretion rate, we argue that the black hole (BH) growth by factor of 8-800 happens in these super-Eddington accretion phase of AGNs. Moreover, there is a possible, systematic underestimation of accretion rates (in the Eddington unit) due to an overestimation of BH mass by massive accretion discs for super-Eddington objects. If it is true, the factor of BH growth above may be larger by order(s) of magnitude. In contrast, the growth factor expected in sub-Eddington phase is only ~ 2. Therefore, the cosmic BH growth by accretion is likely dominated by super-Eddington phase, rather than sub-Eddington phase which is the majority among AGNs. This analysis is based on the fraction and the average accretion rate of NLS1s and NLQs obtained for z ~< 0.5. If those numbers are larger at higher redshift (where BHs were probably less grown), super-Eddington accretion would be even more important in the context of cosmic BH growth history.",0
We clarify that the nonadiabatic scheme based on a parallel extension of the adiabatic scenario cannot realize the desired goal of quantum computation.,0
We investigate non-linear magneto-transport in a Hall bar device made from a strained InGaAs/InP quantum well: a material system with attractive spintronic properties. From extensive maps of the longitudinal differential resistance (r_xx) as a function of current and magnetic (B-) field phase diagrams are generated for quantum Hall breakdown in the strong quantum Hall regime reaching filling factor $\nu$=1. By careful illumination the electron sheet density (n) is incremented in small steps and this provides insight into how the transport characteristics evolve with n. We explore in depth the energetics of integer quantum Hall breakdown and provide a simple picture for the principal features in the r_xx maps. A simple tunneling model that captures a number of the characteristic features is introduced. Parameters such as critical Hall electric fields and the exchange-enhanced g-factors for odd-filling factors including nu=1 are extracted. A detailed examination is made of the B-field dependence of the critical current as determined by two different methods and compiled for different values of n. A simple rescaling procedure that allows the critical current data points obtained from r_xx maxima for even-filling to collapse on to a single curve is demonstrated. Exchange-enhanced g-factors for odd-filling are extracted from the compiled data and are compared to those determined by conventional thermal activation measurements. The exchange-enhanced g-factor is found to increase with decreasing n.,0

"We present results on spin and charge correlations in two-dimensional quantum dots as a function of increasing Coulomb strength (dielectric constant). We look specifically at the orbital occupation of both spin and charge. We find that charge and spin evolve separately, especially at low Coulomb strength. For the charge, we find that a hole develops in the core orbitals at strong Coulomb repulsion, invalidating the common segregation of confined electrons into an inert core and active valence electrons. For excitations, we find a total spin-projection $S_z = -1/2$ breaks apart into separate occupations of positive and negative spin. This dissociation is caused by spin correlations alone. Quantum fluctuations arising from long-range Coulomb repulsion destroy the spin dissociation and eventually results in all orbitals carrying a negative spin.",0
"We study the evolution of orbital patterns in ferromagnetic layered ruthenates due to the competition of Coulomb interactions, compressive c axis and orthorhombic distortions in the presence of a polarizing orbital field coupled to the angular momentum. By means of the exact diagonalization on a 2x2 cluster and a cluster embedded analysis where inter-plaquette interaction is treated on mean field level, we determine the ground-state phase diagram. Specifically, we demonstrate that, via the activation of two or three of t_2g local orbital configurations, an external field applied along different symmetry directions can lead to inequivalent orbital correlated states. Starting from an antiferro-orbital pattern, for the easy axis case an orbital ordered phase is induced, having strong next nearest neighbors ferro-orbital correlations. Otherwise, a field applied along the hard axis leads a reduction of local orbital moment in a way to suppress the orbital order.",0
"We study a reduced quantum circuit computation paradigm in which the only allowable gates either permute the computational basis states or else apply a """"global Hadamard operation"""", i.e. apply a Hadamard operation to every qubit simultaneously. In this model, we discuss complexity bounds (lower-bounding the number of global Hadamard operations) for common quantum algorithms : we illustrate upper bounds for Shor's Algorithm, and prove lower bounds for Grover's Algorithm. We also use our formalism to display a gate that is neither quantum-universal nor classically simulable, on the assumption that Integer Factoring is not in BPP.",0
"Shadowing trajectories are model trajectories consistent with a sequence of observations of a system, given a distribution of observational noise. The existence of such trajectories is a desirable property of any forecast model. Gradient descent of indeterminism is a well-established technique for finding shadowing trajectories in low-dimensional analytical systems. Here we apply it to the thermally-driven rotating annulus, a laboratory experiment intermediate in model complexity and physical idealisation between analytical systems and global, comprehensive atmospheric models. We work in the perfect model scenario using the MORALS model to generate a sequence of noisy observations in a chaotic flow regime. We demonstrate that the gradient descent technique recovers a pseudo-orbit of model states significantly closer to a model trajectory than the initial sequence. Gradient-free descent is used, where the adjoint model is set to $\lambda$I in the absence of a full adjoint model. The indeterminism of the pseudo-orbit falls by two orders of magnitude during the descent, but we find that the distance between the pseudo-orbit and the initial, true, model trajectory reaches a minimum and then diverges from truth. We attribute this to the use of the $\lambda$-adjoint, which is well suited to noise reduction but not to finely-tuned convergence towards a model trajectory. We find that $\lambda=0.25$ gives optimal results, and that candidate model trajectories begun from this pseudo-orbit shadow the observations for up to 80 s, about the length of the longest timescale of the system, and similar to expected shadowing times based on the distance between the pseudo-orbit and the truth. There is great potential for using this method with real laboratory data.",0

"The nature of the ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) in the nearby galaxies is a matter of debates. One of the popular hypothesis associates them with accretion at a sub-Eddington rate on to intermediate mass black holes. Another possibility is a stellar-mass black hole in a high-mass X-ray binary accreting at super-Eddington rates. In this paper we find a highly significant association between brightest X-ray sources in the Antennae galaxies and stellar clusters. On the other hand, we show that most of the X-ray sources are located outside of these clusters. We study clusters associated with the ULXs using the ESO Very Large Telescope spectra and the Hubble Space Telescope data together with the theoretical evolutionary tracks and determine their ages to be below 6 Myr. This implies that the ULX progenitor masses certainly exceed 30 and for some objects are closer to 100 solar masses. We also estimate the ages of clusters situated close to the less luminous X-ray sources (with luminosity in the range 3x10^38 < L_X < 10^39 erg/s) and find that most of them are younger than 10 Myr, because they are surrounded by strong H$\alpha$ emission. These findings are consistent with the idea that majority of ULXs are massive X-ray binaries that have been ejected in the process of formation of stellar clusters by a few-body encounters and at the same time rules out the proposal that most of the ULXs are intermediate mass black holes.",0

"In this work we prove the real Nullstellensatz for the ring ${\mathcal O}(X)$ of analytic functions on a $C$-analytic set $X\subset{\mathbb R}^n$ in terms of the saturation of \L ojasiewicz's radical in ${\mathcal O}(X)$: The ideal ${\mathcal I}({\mathcal Z}({\mathfrak a}))$ of the zero-set ${\mathcal Z}({\mathfrak a})$ of an ideal ${\mathfrak a}$ of ${\mathcal O}(X)$ coincides with the saturation $\widetilde{\sqrt[\text{\L}]{{\mathfrak a}}}$ of \L ojasiewicz's radical $\sqrt[\text{\L}]{{\mathfrak a}}$. If ${\mathcal Z}({\mathfrak a})$ has `good properties' concerning Hilbert's 17th Problem, then ${\mathcal I}({\mathcal Z}({\mathfrak a}))=\widetilde{\sqrt[\mathsf{r}]{{\mathfrak a}}}$ where $\sqrt[\mathsf{r}]{{\mathfrak a}}$ stands for the real radical of ${\mathfrak a}$. The same holds if we replace $\sqrt[\mathsf{r}]{{\mathfrak a}}$ with the real-analytic radical $\sqrt[\mathsf{ra}]{{\mathfrak a}}$ of ${\mathfrak a}$, which is a natural generalisation of the real radical ideal in the $C$-analytic setting. We revisit the classical results concerning (Hilbert's) Nullstellensatz in the framework of (complex) Stein spaces. Let ${\mathfrak a}$ be a saturated ideal of ${\mathcal O}({\mathbb R}^n)$ and $Y_{{\mathbb R}^n}$ the germ of the support of the coherent sheaf that extends ${\mathfrak a}{\mathcal O}_{{\mathbb R}^n}$ to a suitable complex open neighbourhood of ${\mathbb R}^n$. We study the relationship between a normal primary decomposition of ${\mathfrak a}$ and the decomposition of $Y_{{\mathbb R}^n}$ as the union of its irreducible components. If ${\mathfrak a}:={\mathfrak p}$ is prime, then ${\mathcal I}({\mathcal Z}({\mathfrak p}))={\mathfrak p}$ if and only if the (complex) dimension of $Y_{{\mathbb R}^n}$ coincides with the (real) dimension of ${\mathcal Z}({\mathfrak p})$.",0
"Passive Optical Networks (PON) technology brings an evolution in the industry of Telecommunication for the provisioning of High Speed Internet (HSI) and Triple Play bundled Services that includes Voice, Data, and Video Streaming throughout the world. In Pakistan most of the service providers are offering broadband services on traditional copper OSP (Outside Plant) network since 2000. Demand for the high speed internet and broadband is increasing rapidly, it is desired with great need to migrate from traditional copper based OSP network to PON _ FTTx (Fiber To The x) infrastructure. Considering the geographical requirements in Pakistan a scalable fiber network is required which can be optimized as per the users requirements and demands with high speed bandwidth efficiency, involving the minimum losses and with ideal capital expenditure (CAPEX). In this work a platform for migration from copper to fiber access network with a scalable and optimized PON _ FTTx infrastructure in green field and dry field areas of Pakistan have been proposed using Geographic Information system (GIS). In any developing country like Pakistan having the same cultural and geographical topology, this platform can be used to migrate from copper to fiber access network to provide the PON based telecom services. The developed platform for migration from copper to PON based fiber has been studied, planned, and then simulated on a selected geographical area of Pakistan with physical execution that showed better and efficient results with reduction in capital and operational expenditures.

"Adopting the gauge-invariant and path-dependent variables formalism, we compute the interaction energy for a topological field theory describing $(1+3)$D topological superconductors in presence of external fields. As a result, in the case of a constant electric field- strength expectation value, we show that the interaction energy describes a purely screening phase, encoded in a Yukawa potential. On the other hand, in the case of a constant magnetic field-strength and for a very small Josephson coupling constant, the particle-antiparticle binding potential displays a linear term leading to the confinement of static charge probes along with a screening contribution.",0
"Structural relaxation in binary hard spherical particles has been shown recently to exhibit a wealth of remarkable features when size disparity or mixture's composition is varied. In this paper, we test whether or not similar dynamical phenomena occur in glassy systems composed of binary hard ellipses. We demonstrate via event-driven molecular dynamics simulation that a binary hard-ellipse mixture with an aspect ratio of two and moderate size disparity displays characteristic glassy dynamics upon increasing density in both the translational and the rotational degrees of freedom. The rotational glass transition density is found to be close to the translational one for the binary mixtures investigated. More importantly, we assess the influence of size disparity and mixture's composition on the relaxation dynamics. We find that an increase of size disparity leads, both translationally and rotationally, to a speed up of the long-time dynamics in the supercooled regime so that both the translational and the rotational glass transition shift to higher densities. By increasing the number concentration of the small particles, the time evolution of both translational and rotational relaxation dynamics at high densities displays two qualitatively different scenarios, i.e., both the initial and the final part of the structural relaxation slow down for small size disparity, while the short-time dynamics still slows down but the final decay speeds up in the binary mixture with large size disparity. These findings are reminiscent of those observed in binary hard spherical particles. Therefore, our results suggest a universal mechanism for the influence of size disparity and mixture's composition on the structural relaxation in both isotropic and anisotropic particle systems.",0
"We present results related to the performance of an algorithm for community detection which incorporates event-driven computation. We define a mapping which takes a graph G to a system of spiking neurons. Using a fully connected spiking neuron system, with both inhibitory and excitatory synaptic connections, the firing patterns of neurons within the same community can be distinguished from firing patterns of neurons in different communities. On a random graph with 128 vertices and known community structure we show that by using binary decoding and a Hamming-distance based metric, individual communities can be identified from spike train similarities. Using bipolar decoding and finite rate thresholding, we verify that inhibitory connections prevent the spread of spiking patterns.",0
"The theory of the elastic scattering of a nucleon from a nucleus is presented in the form of a Spectator Expansion of the optical potential. Particular attention is paid to the treatment of the free projectile$\,-\,$nucleus propagator when the coupling of the struck target nucleon to the residual target must be taken into consideration. First order calculations within this framework are shown for neutron total cross-sections and for proton scattering for a number of target nuclides at a variety of energies. The calculated values of these observables are in very good agreement with measurement.",0
We address the question of the classification under blow-Nash equivalence of simple Nash function germs. We state that this classification coincides with the real analytic classification. We prove moreover that a simple germ can not be blow-Nash equivalent to a nonsimple one. The method is based on the computation of relevant coefficients of the real zeta functions associated to a Nash germ via motivic integration.,0
The structure of $^8$He is investigated within a three-cluster microscopic model. The three-cluster configuration $\alpha+^2n+^2n$ was used to describe the properties of the ground state of the nucleus. The obtained results evidently indicate the existence of a neutron halo in $^8$He.,0
"We study a model of a stripe ordered doped antiferromagnet consisting of coupled Hubbard ladders which can be tuned from quasi-one-dimensional to two-dimensional. We solve for the magnetization and charge density on the ladders by Hartree-Fock theory and find a set of solutions with lightly doped ``spin-stripes'' which are antiferromagnetic and more heavily doped anti-phase ``charge-stripes''. Both the spin- and charge-stripes have electronic spectral weight near the Fermi energy but in different regions of the Brillouin zone; the spin-stripes in the ``nodal'' region, near (\pi/2,\pi/2), and the charge-stripes in the ``antinodal'' region, near (\pi,0). We find a striking dichotomy between nodal and antinodal states in which the nodal states are essentially delocalized and two-dimensional whereas the antinodal states are quasi-one-dimensional, localized on individual charge-stripes. For bond-centered stripes we also find an even-odd effect of the charge periodicity which could explain the non-monotonous variations with doping of the low-temperature resistivity in LSCO",0
"We recalculate the leading relativistic corrections for the ground electronic state of the hydrogen molecule using variational method with explicitly correlated functions which satisfy the interelectronic cusp condition. The new computational approach allowed for the control of the numerical precision which reached about 8 significant digits. More importantly, the updated theoretical energies became discrepant with the known experimental values and we conclude that the yet unknown relativistic recoil corrections might be larger than previously anticipated.",0
"An effective, low temperature, classical model for spin transport in the one-dimensional, gapped, quantum $O(3)$ non-linear $\sigma$-model is developed. Its correlators are obtained by a mapping to a model solved earlier by Jepsen. We obtain universal functions for the ballistic-to-diffusive crossover and the value of the spin diffusion constant, and these are claimed to be exact at low temperatures. Implications for experiments on one-dimensional insulators with a spin gap are noted.",0
"Wireless sensor and actuator networks are gaining momentum in the era of Industrial Internet of Things IIoT. The usage of the close-loop data from sensors in the manufacturing chain is extending the common monitoring scenario of the Wireless Sensors Networks WSN where data were just logged. In this paper we present an accurate timing synchronization for TDMA implemented on the state of art IoT radio, such as LoRa, that is a good solution in industrial environments for its high robustness. Experimental results show how it is possible to modulate the drift correction and keep the synchronization error within the requirements.",0
"Complex networks have been mostly characterized from the point of view of the degree distribution of their nodes and a few other motifs (or modules), with a special attention to triangles and cliques. The most exotic phenomena have been observed when the exponent $\gamma$ of the associated power law degree-distribution is sufficiently small. In particular, a zero percolation threshold takes place for $\gamma<3$, and an anomalous critical behavior sets in for $\gamma<5$. In this Letter we prove that in sparse scale-free networks characterized by a cut-off scaling with the sistem size $N$, relative fluctuations are actually never negligible: given a motif $\Gamma$, we analyze the relative fluctuations $R_{\Gamma}$ of the associated density of $\Gamma$, and we show that there exists an interval in $\gamma$, $[\gamma_1,\gamma_2]$, where $R_{\Gamma}$ does not go to zero in the thermodynamic limit, where $\gamma_1\approx k_{\mathrm{min}}$ and $\gamma_2\approx 2 k_{\mathrm{max}}$, $k_{\mathrm{min}}$ and $k_{\mathrm{max}}$ being the smallest and the largest degree of $\Gamma$, respectively. Remarkably, in $(\gamma_1,\gamma_2)$ $R_{\Gamma}$ diverges, implying the instability of $\Gamma$ to small perturbations.",0
"We review recent progress in understanding the notion of locality in integrable quantum lattice systems. The central concept are the so-called quasilocal conserved quantities, which go beyond the standard perception of locality. Two systematic procedures to rigorously construct families of quasilocal conserved operators based on quantum transfer matrices are outlined, specializing on anisotropic Heisenberg XXZ spin-1/2 chain. Quasilocal conserved operators stem from two distinct classes of representations of the auxiliary space algebra, comprised of unitary (compact) representations, which can be naturally linked to the fusion algebra and quasiparticle content of the model, and non-unitary (non-compact) representations giving rise to charges, manifestly orthogonal to the unitary ones. Various condensed matter applications in which quasilocal conservation laws play an essential role are presented, with special emphasis on their implications for anomalous transport properties (finite Drude weight) and relaxation to non-thermal steady states in the quantum quench scenario.",0
"We consider a set of secondary transmitter-receiver pairs in a cognitive radio setting. Based on channel sensing and access performances, we consider the problem of assigning channels orthogonally to secondary users through distributed coordination and cooperation algorithms. Two economic models are applied for this purpose: matching markets and competitive markets. In the matching market model, secondary users and channels build two agent sets. We implement a stable matching algorithm in which each secondary user, based on his achievable rate, proposes to the coordinator to be matched with desirable channels. The coordinator accepts or rejects the proposals based on the channel preferences which depend on interference from the secondary user. The coordination algorithm is of low complexity and can adapt to network dynamics. In the competitive market model, channels are associated with prices and secondary users are endowed with monetary budget. Each secondary user, based on his utility function and current channel prices, demands a set of channels. A Walrasian equilibrium maximizes the sum utility and equates the channel demand to their supply. We prove the existence of Walrasian equilibrium and propose a cooperative mechanism to reach it. The performance and complexity of the proposed solutions are illustrated by numerical simulations.",0
"We report on high resolution spectroscopy of four giant stars in the Galactic old open clusters Berkeley~22 and Berkeley~66 obtained with HIRES at the Keck telescope. We find that $[Fe/H]=-0.32\pm0.19$ and $[Fe/H]=-0.48\pm0.24$ for Berkeley~22 and Berkeley~66, respectively. Based on these data, we first revise the fundamental parameters of the clusters, and then discuss them in the context of the Galactic disk radial abundance gradient. We found that both clusters nicely obey the most updated estimate of the slope of the gradient from \citet{fri02} and are genuine Galactic disk objects.",0
"We present results for the confinement-deconfinement interface tension $\sigma_{cd}$ of quenched QCD. They were obtained by applying Binder's histogram method to lattices of size $L^2\times L_z\times L_t$ for $L_t=2$ and $L=8,10,12\mbox{ and }14$ and various $L_z\in [L,\, 4\, L]$. The use of a multicanonical algorithm and rectangular geometries have turned out to be crucial for the numerical studies. We also give an estimate for $\sigma_{cd}$ at $L_t=4$ using published data.",0
"The Navier--Stokes equations for incompressible flows past a two--dimensional sphere are considered in this article. The existence of an inertial form of the equations is established. Furthermore for the first time for fluid equations, we derive an upper bound on the dimension of the differential system (inertial manifold) which fully reproduces the infinite dimensional dynamics. This bound is expressed in terms of Grashof Numbers.",0
"Datasets are often used multiple times and each successive analysis may depend on the outcome of previous analyses. Standard techniques for ensuring generalization and statistical validity do not account for this adaptive dependence. A recent line of work studies the challenges that arise from such adaptive data reuse by considering the problem of answering a sequence of """"queries"""" about the data distribution where each query may depend arbitrarily on answers to previous queries. The strongest results obtained for this problem rely on differential privacy -- a strong notion of algorithmic stability with the important property that it """"composes"""" well when data is reused. However the notion is rather strict, as it requires stability under replacement of an arbitrary data element. The simplest algorithm is to add Gaussian (or Laplace) noise to distort the empirical answers. However, analysing this technique using differential privacy yields suboptimal accuracy guarantees when the queries have low variance. Here we propose a relaxed notion of stability that also composes adaptively. We demonstrate that a simple and natural algorithm based on adding noise scaled to the standard deviation of the query provides our notion of stability. This implies an algorithm that can answer statistical queries about the dataset with substantially improved accuracy guarantees for low-variance queries. The only previous approach that provides such accuracy guarantees is based on a more involved differentially private median-of-means algorithm and its analysis exploits stronger """"group"""" stability of the algorithm.",0
"Single-crystalline thin film of an iridium dioxide polymorph Ir2O4 has been fabricated by the pulsed laser deposition of LixIr2O4 precursor and the subsequent Li-deintercalation using soft chemistry. Ir2O4 crystallizes in a spinel (AB2O4) without A cations in the tetrahedral site, which is isostructural to lambda-MnO2. Ir ions form a pyrochlore sublattice, which is known to give rise to a strong geometrical frustration. This Ir spinel was found to be a narrow gap insulator, in remarkable contrast to the metallic ground state of rutile-type IrO2. We argue that an interplay of strong spin-orbit coupling and a Coulomb repulsion gives rise to an insulating ground state as in a layered perovskite Sr2IrO4.",0
"We construct a homogeneous subspace of $2^\omega$ whose complement is dense in $2^\omega$ and rigid. Using the same method, assuming Martin's Axiom, we also construct a countable dense homogeneous subspace of $2^\omega$ whose complement is dense in $2^\omega$ and rigid.",0
"The paper demonstrates the optimization of the execution environment of a hybrid OpenMP+MPI computational fluid dynamics code (shallow water equation solver) on a cluster enabled with Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors. The discussion includes: (1) Controlling the number and affinity of OpenMP threads to optimize access to memory bandwidth; (2) Tuning the inter-operation of OpenMP and MPI to partition the problem for better data locality; (3) Ordering the MPI ranks in a way that directs some of the traffic into faster communication channels; (4) Using efficient peer-to-peer communication between Xeon Phi coprocessors based on the InfiniBand fabric. With tuning, the application has 90% percent efficiency of parallel scaling up to 8 Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors in 2 compute nodes. For larger problems, scalability is even better, because of the greater computation to communication ratio. However, problems of that size do not fit in the memory of one coprocessor. The performance of the solver on one Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor 7120P exceeds the performance on a dual-socket Intel Xeon E5-2697 v2 CPU by a factor of 1.6x. In a 2-node cluster with 4 coprocessors per compute node, the MIC architecture yields 5.8x more performance than the CPUs. Only one line of legacy Fortran code had to be changed in order to achieve the reported performance on the MIC architecture (not counting changes to the command-line interface). The methodology discussed in this paper is directly applicable to other bandwidth-bound stencil algorithms utilizing a hybrid OpenMP+MPI approach.",0
"A set S of 2n+1 points in the plane is said to be in general position if no three points of S are collinear and no four are concyclic. A circle is called halving with respect to S if it has three points of S on its circumference, n-1 points in its interior, and n-1 in its exterior. We prove the following surprising result: any set of 2n+1 points in general position in the plane has exactly n^2 halving circles.",0
"Suppose that a finite group $G$ acts on a smooth complex variety $X$. Then this action lifts to the Chiral de Rham Complex of $X$ and to its cohomology by automorphisms of the vertex algebra structure. We define twisted sectors for the Chiral de Rham Complex (and their cohomologies) as sheaves of twisted vertex algebra modules supported on the components of the fixed-point sets $X^{g}, g \in G$. Each twisted sector sheaf carries a BRST differential and is quasi-isomorphic to the de Rham complex of $X^{g}$. Putting the twisted sectors together with the vacuum sector and taking $G$--invariants, we recover the additive and graded structures of Chen-Ruan orbifold cohomology. Finally, we show that the orbifold elliptic genus is the partition function of the direct sum of the cohomologies of the twisted sectors.",0
"We analyze the combined effect of Poynting-Robertson and solar wind drag on space debris. We derive a model within Cartesian, Gaussian and Hamiltonian frameworks. We focus on the geosynchronous resonance, although the results can be easily generalized to any resonance. By numerical and analytical techniques, we compute the drift in semi-major axis due to Poynting-Robertson and solar wind drag. After a linear stability analysis of the equilibria, we combine a careful investigation of the regular, resonant, chaotic behavior of the phase space with a long-term propagation of a sample of initial conditions. The results strongly depend on the value of the area-to-mass ratio of the debris, which might show different dynamical behaviors: temporary capture or escape from the geosynchronous resonance, as well as temporary capture or escape from secondary resonances involving the rate of variation of the longitude of the Sun. Such analysis shows that Poynting-Robertson and solar wind drag must be taken into account, when looking at the long-term behavior of space debris. Trapping or escape from the resonance can be used to place the debris in convenient regions of the phase space.",0
"One-photon and two-photon wavepackets of entangled two-photon states in spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) fields are calculated and measured experimentally. For type-II SPDC, measured one-photon and two-photon wavepackets agree well with theory. For type-I SPDC, the measured one-photon wavepacket agree with the theory. However, the two-photon wavepacket is much bigger than the expected value and the visibility of interference is low. We identify the sources of this discrepancy as the spatial filtering of the two-photon bandwidth and non-pair detection events caused by the detector apertures and the tuning curve characteristics of the type-I SPDC.",0
"We obtain exact results in \alpha' for open and closed A-model topological string amplitudes on a large class of toric Calabi-Yau threefolds by using their correspondence with five dimensional gauge theories. The toric Calabi-Yau's that we analyze are obtained as minimal resolution of cones over Y(p,q) manifolds and give rise via M-theory compactification to SU(p) gauge theories on R^4 x S^1. As an application we present a detailed study of the local F_2 case and compute open and closed genus zero Gromov-Witten invariants of the C^3/Z_4 orbifold. We also display the modular structure of the topological wave function and give predictions for higher genus amplitudes.The mirror curve in this case is the spectral curve of the relativistic A_1 Toda chain. Our results also indicate the existence of a wider class of relativistic integrable systems associated to generic Y(p,q) geometries.",0
The massive IIA string theory whose low energy limit is the massive supergravity theory constructed by Romans is obtained from M-theory compactified on a 2-torus bundle over a circle in a limit in which the volume of the bundle shrinks to zero. The massive string theories in 9-dimensions given by Scherk-Schwarz reduction of IIB string theory are interpreted as F-theory compactified on 2-torus bundles over a circle. The M-theory solution that gives rise to the D8-brane of the massive IIA theory is identified. Generalisations of Scherk-Schwarz reduction are discussed.,0
"Many new states in the charmonium and bottomonium mass region were recently discovered by the BaBar, Belle and CDF Collaborations. We use the QCD Sum Rule approach to study the possible structure of some of these states. In particular we identify the recently observed bottomonium-like resonance $Z_b^+(10610)$ with the first excitation of the tetraquark $X_b(1^{++})$, the analogue of the X(3872) state in the charm sector.",0
In this paper the equation of circular loops of cosmic string with periodic tension is investigated in the Minkowski spacetime and Robertson-Walker universe respectively. We find that the cosmic string loops possessing this kind of time-varying tension will evolve to oscillate instead of collapsing to form a black hole if their initial radii are not small enough.,0
"Density functional theory calculations have been performed to study the structures and energetics of coherent and semicoherent TiC/Fe interfaces. A systematic method for determining the interfacial energy for the semicoherent interface with misfit dislocation network has been developed. The obtained interfacial energies are used to calculate the aspect ratios for the disc-like precipitates and a quantitative agreement with the experimental results is reached. Based on the obtained interfacial energies and atomic structure details, we propose models for describing the evolution of the interfacial energy with respect to the size of TiC precipitate for heterogeneous nucleation on an edge dislocation, shedding light on the thermodynamics of precipitate nucleation and growth. The present method can be easily applied to any heterophase interfaces between metals and oxides/carbides/nitrides.",0
"The properties of Josephson tunneling between a single band s-wave superconductor and a two band $s_\pm$ superconductor are studied, in relation to recent experiments involving iron-based superconductors. We study a single junction and tune the order parameter (OP) phase difference across the junction. We find a variety of behaviors which are characterized by their energy-phase difference relation. The system is modeled on a lattice and treated in self-consistent mean field approximation. We also study a loop structure made with s-wave and $s_\pm$ parts with two junctions between the parts. The phase of the order parameter is then controlled by a magnetic flux threading the loop. Our analysis suggests four types of junction behaviors which are characterized by the dependence of the junction energy on the phase difference between the s-wave and the $s_\pm$ superconductors. The energy vs. phase difference curve has either one minimum at $\Delta\phi = 0,\pi$ or somewhere in between, or a double minimum structure. This leads to four different behaviors in a loop structure as a function of the flux threaded through the loop.",0
"Time-dependent B0-anti-B0 flavor oscillations are studied in e+e- annihilation data collected with the BABAR detector at center-of-mass energies near the Upsilon(4S) resonance. We report a preliminary result for the time-dependent B0-anti-B0 oscillation frequency, Delta_md = 0.512 +/- 0.017 +/- 0.022 hbar ps^{-1}.",0
"The heavy burdens of computation and off-chip traffic impede deploying the large scale convolution neural network on embedded platforms. As CNN is attributed to the strong endurance to computation errors, employing block floating point (BFP) arithmetics in CNN accelerators could save the hardware cost and data traffics efficiently, while maintaining the classification accuracy. In this paper, we verify the effects of word width definitions in BFP to the CNN performance without retraining. Several typical CNN models, including VGG16, ResNet-18, ResNet-50 and GoogLeNet, were tested in this paper. Experiments revealed that 8-bit mantissa, including sign bit, in BFP representation merely induced less than 0.3% accuracy loss. In addition, we investigate the computational errors in theory and develop the noise-to-signal ratio (NSR) upper bound, which provides the promising guidance for BFP based CNN engine design.",0
"A family of lines through the origin in Euclidean space is called equiangular if any pair of lines defines the same angle. The problem of estimating the maximum cardinality of such a family in $\mathbb{R}^n$ was extensively studied for the last 70 years. Motivated by a question of Lemmens and Seidel from 1973, in this paper we prove that for every fixed angle $\theta$ and sufficiently large $n$ there are at most $2n-2$ lines in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with common angle $\theta$. Moreover, this is achievable only for $\theta = \arccos(1/3)$. We also show that for any set of $k$ fixed angles, one can find at most $O(n^k)$ lines in $\mathbb{R}^n$ having these angles. This bound, conjectured by Bukh, substantially improves the estimate of Delsarte, Goethals and Seidel from 1975. Various extensions of these results to the more general setting of spherical codes will be discussed as well.",0
"We study the transfer of heat in the non-equilibrium spin-boson model with an Ohmic dissipation. In the non-adiabatic limit we derive a formula for the thermal conductance based on a rate equation formalism at the level of the non-interacting blip approximation, valid for temperatures $T>T_K$, with $T_K$ as the Kondo temperature. We evaluate this expression analytically assuming either weak or strong couplings, and demonstrate that our results agree with exact relations. Far-from-equilibrium situations are further examined, showing a close correspondence to the linear response limit.",0
"This paper presents some of the results of the first year of DANSE, one of the first EU IP projects dedicated to SoS. Concretely, we offer a tool chain that allows to specify SoS and SoS requirements at high level, and analyse them using powerful toolsets coming from the formal verification area. At the high level, we use UPDM, the system model provided by the british army as well as a new type of contract based on behavioral patterns. At low level, we rely on a powerful simulation toolset combined with recent advances from the area of statistical model checking. The approach has been applied to a case study developed at EADS Innovation Works.",0
"Errors in applying regression models and wavelet filters used to analyze geophysical signals are discussed: (1) multidecadal natural oscillations (e.g. the quasi 60-year Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)) need to be taken into account for properly quantifying anomalous accelerations in tide gauge records such as in New York City; (2) uncertainties and multicollinearity among climate forcing functions prevent a proper evaluation of the solar contribution to the 20th century global surface temperature warming using overloaded linear regression models during the 1900-2000 period alone; (3) when periodic wavelet filters, which require that a record is pre-processed with a reflection methodology, are improperly applied to decompose non-stationary solar and climatic time series, Gibbs boundary artifacts emerge yielding misleading physical interpretations. By correcting these errors and using optimized regression models that reduce multicollinearity artifacts, I found the following results: (1) the sea level in New York City is not accelerating in an alarming way, and may increase by about 350 mm from 2000 to 2100 instead of the previously projected values varying from 1130 mm to 1550 mm estimated using the methods proposed by Sallenger et al. (2012) and Boon (2012), respectively; (2) the solar activity increase during the 20th century contributed about 50% of the 0.8 K global warming observed during the 20th century instead of only 7-10% (IPCC, 2007; Benestad and Schmidt, 2009; Lean and Rind, 2009). These findings stress the importance of natural oscillations and of the sun to properly interpret climatic changes.",0
"Aims. Core-collapse supernovae may show significant polarization that implies non-spherically symmetric explosions. We observed the type II-plateau SN 2005af using optical polarimetry in order to verify whether any asphericity is present in the supernova temporal evolution. Methods. We used the IAGPOL imaging polarimeter to obtain optical linear polarization measurements in R (five epochs) and V (one epoch) broadbands. Interstellar polarization was estimated from the field stars in the CCD frames. The optical polarimetric monitoring began around one month after the explosion and lasted ~30 days, between the plateau and the early nebular phase. Results. The weighted mean observed polarization in R band was [1.89 +/- 0.03]% at position angle (PA) 54 deg. After foreground subtraction, the level of the average intrinsic polarization for SN 2005af was ~0.5% with a slight enhancement during the plateau phase and a decline at early nebular phase. A rotation in PA on a time scale of days was also observed. The polarimetric evolution of SN 2005af in the observed epochs is consistent with an overall asphericity of ~20% and an inclination of ~30 deg. Evidence for a more complex, evolving asphericity, possibly involving clumps in the SN 2005af envelope, is found.",0
A new renormalization scheme for theories with nontrivial internal symmetry is proposed. The scheme is regularization independent and respects the symmetry requirements.,0

"We present a space-time generalization of the known spatial (monochromatic) wave vortex beams carrying intrinsic orbital angular momentum (OAM) along the propagation direction. Generic spatio-temporal vortex beams are polychromatic and can carry intrinsic OAM at an arbitrary angle to the mean momentum. Applying either (i) a transverse wave-vector shift or (ii) a Lorentz boost to a monochromatic Bessel beam, we construct a family of either (i) time-diffracting or (ii) non-diffracting spatio-temporal Bessel beams, which are exact solutions of the Klein-Gordon wave equations. The proposed spatio-temporal OAM states are able to describe either photon or electron vortex states (both relativistic and nonrelativistic), and can find applications in particle collisions, optics of moving media, quantum communications, and astrophysics.",0
"The goal of this paper is twofold. First, we present a unified way of formulating numerical integration problems from both approximation theory and discrepancy theory. Second, we show how techniques, developed in approximation theory, work in proving lower bounds for recently developed new type of discrepancy -- the smooth discrepancy.",0

"A mass formula (BWM) without shell effect is employed to study the variation of the shell effect in Pb isotopes through comparison with the experimental data. Unlike other macroscopic formulae, the BWM reproduces the general trend of the binding energy versus neutron number curves of all the nuclei from Li to Bi. The shell effect in Pb-isotopes reduces to ~56 keV at N=106 but, increases gradually for N<106, indicating increasing shell effect in Pb near the proton drip line.",0
"When a ligand that is bound to an integral membrane receptor is pulled, the membrane and the underlying cytoskeleton can deform before either the membrane delaminates from the cytoskeleton or the ligand detaches from the receptor. If the membrane delaminates from the cytoskeleton, it may be further extruded and form a membrane tether. We develop a phenomenological model for this processes by assuming that deformations obey Hooke's law up to a critical force at which the cell membrane locally detaches from the cytoskeleton and a membrane tether forms. We compute the probability of tether formation and show that they can be extruded only within an intermediate range of force loading rates and pulling velocities. The mean tether length that arises at the moment of ligand detachment is computed as are the force loading rates and pulling velocities that yield the longest tethers.",0
"We demonstrate matterwave interference in a warm vapor of rubidium atoms. Established approaches to light pulse atom interferometry rely on laser cooling to concentrate a large ensemble of atoms into a velocity class resonant with the atom optical light pulse. In our experiment, we show that clear interference signals may be obtained without laser cooling. This effect relies on the Doppler selectivity of the atom interferometer resonance. This interferometer may be configured to measure accelerations, and we demonstrate that multiple interferometers may be operated simultaneously by addressing multiple velocity classes.",0
"A quantum mechanical theory is developed for the statistics of momentum transferred to the lattice by conduction electrons. Results for the electromechanical noise power in the semiclassical diffusive transport regime agree with a recent theory based on the Boltzmann-Langevin equation. All moments of the transferred momentum are calculated for a single-channel conductor with a localized scatterer, and compared with the known statistics of transmitted charge.",0

"Within the mean field theory we extend the effective quasi-1D non-polynomial Schr\""""{o}dinger equation (NPSE) approach to the description of a spin-1 atomic condensate in a tight radial confinement geometry for both weak and strong atom-atom interactions. Detailed comparisons with full time dependent 3D numerical simulations show excellent agreement as in the case of a single component scalar condensate, demonstrating our result as an efficient and effective tool for the understanding of spin-1 condensate dynamics observed in several recent experiments.",0
"The most accurate measurements of magnetic fields in star-forming gas are based on the Zeeman observations analyzed by Crutcher et al. (2010). We show that their finding that the 3D magnetic field scales approximately as density$^{0.65}$ can also be obtained from analysis of the observed line-of-sight fields. We present two large-scale AMR MHD simulations of several thousand $M_\odot$ of turbulent, isothermal, self-gravitating gas, one with a strong initial magnetic field (Alfven Mach number $M_{A,0}= 1$) and one with a weak initial field ($M_{A,0}=10$). We construct samples of the 100 most massive clumps in each simulation and show that they exhibit a power-law relation between field strength and density in excellent agreement with the observed one. Our results imply that the average field in molecular clumps in the interstellar medium is $<B_{tot}> \sim 42 n_{H,4}^{0.65} \mu$G. Furthermore, the median value of the ratio of the line-of-sight field to density$^{0.65}$ in the simulations is within a factor of about (1.3, 1.7) of the observed value for the strong and weak field cases, respectively. The median value of the mass-to-flux ratio, normalized to the critical value, is 70% of the line-of-sight value. This is larger than the 50% usually cited for spherical clouds because the actual mass-to-flux ratio depends on the volume-weighted field, whereas the observed one depends on the mass-weighted field. Our results indicate that the typical molecular clump in the ISM is significantly supercritical (~ factor of 3). The results of our strong-field model are in very good quantitative agreement with the observations of Li et al. (2009), which show a strong correlation in field orientation between small and large scales. Because there is a negligible correlation in the weak-field model, we conclude that molecular clouds form from strongly magnetized (although magnetically supercritical) gas.",0
"Thermodynamic models present binary interaction parameters, based on the Boltzmann weight. Discrepancies from experimental data lead to empirically consider temperature dependence of the parameters, but these modifications keep unchanged the exponential nature of the equations. We replace the Boltzmann weight by the nonextensive Tsallis weight, and generalize three models for nonelectrolyte solutions that use the local composition hypothesis, namely Wilson's, NRTL, and UNIQUAC models. The proposed generalizations present a nonexponential dependence on the temperature, and relies on a theoretical basis of nonextensive statistical mechanics. The $q$-models present one extra binary parameter $q_{ij}$, that recover the original cases in the limit $q_{ij} \to 1$. Comparison with experimental data is illustrated with two examples of the activity coefficient of ethanol, infinitely diluted in toluene, and in decane.",0
"In this paper, first, I introduce two-layered numbers. Two-layered numbers are positive integers that their positive divisors except 1 can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets. Similarly, I defined a half-layered number as a positive integer n that its proper positive divisors excluding $1$ can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets. I also investigate the properties of two-layered and half-layered numbers and their relation with practical numbers and Zumkeller numbers.",0
We use the functional integral technique of Edwards and Lenard to solve the statistical mechanics of a one dimensional Coulomb gas with boundary interactions leading to surface charging. The theory examined is a one dimensional model for a soap film. Finite size effects and the phenomenon of charge regulation are studied. We also discuss the pressure of disjunction for such a film. Even in the absence of boundary potentials we find that the presence of a surface affects the physics in finite systems. In general we find that in the presence of a boundary potential the long distance disjoining pressure is positive but may become negative at closer interplane separations. This is in accordance with the attractive forces seen at close separations in colloidal and soap film experiments and with three dimensional calculations beyond mean field. Finally our exact results are compared with the predictions of the corresponding Poisson-Boltzmann theory which is often used in the context of colloidal and thin liquid film systems.,0
"An introduction to various topics in neutrino astrophysics is given for students with little prior exposure to this field.

"Strings at T ~ T_c are known to be subject to the so-called Hagedorn phenomenon, in which a string's entropy (times T) and energy cancel each other and result in the evolution of the string into highly excited states, or """"string balls"""". Intrinsic attractive interaction of strings -- gravitational for fundamental strings or in the context of holographic models of the AdS/QCD type, or sigma exchanges for QCD strings -- can significantly modify properties of the string balls. If heavy enough, those start approaching properties of the black holes. We generate self-interacting string balls numerically, in a thermal string lattice model. We found that in a certain range of the interaction coupling constants they morph into a new phase, the """"entropy-rich"""" string balls. These objects can appear in the so-called mixed phase of hadronic matter, produced in heavy ion collisions, as well as possibly in the high multiplicity proton-proton or proton-nucleus collisions. Among discussed applications are jet quenching in the mixed phase and also the study of angular deformations of the string balls.",0
"We investigate experimentally and theoretically the Coherent Population Trapping (CPT) effect occurring in 87Rb D1 line due to the interaction with linearly polarized laser light (lin||lin CPT). In this configuration the coherence has a quadrupol like nature and is strongly influenced by the hyperfine structure of the excited state; consequently the quantum interference between CPT states is an essential feature of this interaction scheme. We study the lin||lin CPT signal as a function of the laser optical detuning. The comparison between experimental and theoretical results allows us to quantify the contribution from different CPT states to the total signal. Based on these results we investigate the signal depending on both the pressure broadening of the optical transition and the laser linewidth, and we find in which conditions the laser linewidth does not degrade the amplitude of the lin||lin CPT.",0
"We present observations and analysis of the host galaxies of 23 heavily dust-obscured gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) observed by the Swift satellite during the years 2005-2009, representing all GRBs with an unambiguous host-frame extinction of A_V>1 mag from this period. Deep observations with Keck, Gemini, VLT, HST, and Spitzer successfully detect the host galaxies and establish spectroscopic or photometric redshifts for all 23 events, enabling us to provide measurements of the intrinsic host star-formation rates, stellar masses, and mean extinctions. Compared to the hosts of unobscured GRBs at similar redshifts, we find that the hosts of dust-obscured GRBs are (on average) more massive by about an order of magnitude and also more rapidly star-forming and dust-obscured. While this demonstrates that GRBs populate all types of star-forming galaxies including the most massive, luminous systems at z~2, at redshifts below 1.5 the overall GRB population continues to show a highly significant aversion away from massive galaxies and a preference for low-mass systems relative to what would be expected given a purely SFR-selected galaxy sample. This supports the notion that the GRB rate is strongly dependent on metallicity, and may suggest that the most massive galaxies in the Universe underwent a transition in their chemical properties ~9 Gyr ago. We also conclude that, based on the absence of unobscured GRBs in massive galaxies and the absence of obscured GRBs in low-mass galaxies, the dust distributions of the lowest-mass and the highest-mass galaxies are relatively homogeneous, while intermediate-mass galaxies (~10^9 M_sun) have diverse internal properties.",0
Disorder-broadened 1st order transitions may not carry the experimental signature of a latent heat. We discuss what experimental observation can provide a necessary and sufficient condition for characterizing this phase transition as 1st order.,0
"Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) is a well-known imaging modality which allows for \textit{in-vivo} visualization of the morphology of different biological tissues at cellular level resolutions. The overall SD-OCT imaging quality in terms of axial resolution and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) degrades with imaging depth, while the lateral resolution degrades with distance from the focal plane. This image quality degradation is due both to the design of the SD-OCT imaging system and the optical properties of the imaged object. Here, we present a novel Depth Compensated SD-OCT (DC-OCT) system that integrates a Depth Compensating Digital Signal Processing (DC-DSP) module to improve the overall imaging quality via digital compensation. The designed DC-DSP module can be integrated to any SD-OCT system and is able to simultaneously compensate for the depth-dependent loss of axial and lateral resolutions, depth-varying SNR, as well as sidelobe artifact for improved imaging quality. The integrated DC-DSP module is based on a unified Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) framework which incorporates a Stochastically Fully-connected Conditional Random Field (SF-CRF) model to produce tomograms with reduced speckle noise and artifact, as well as higher spatial resolution. The performance of our proposed DC-OCT system was tested on a USAF resolution target as well as different biological tissue samples, and the results demonstrate the potential of the proposed DC-OCT system for improving spatial resolution, contrast, and SNR.",0
We show existence and uniqueness of a continuous with polynomial growth viscosity solution of a system of second order integral-partial differential equations (IPDEs for short) without assuming the usual monotonicity condition of the generator with respect to the jump component as in Barles et al.'s article \cite{BarlesBuckPardoux}. The L\'evy measure is arbitrary and not necessarily finite. In our study the main tool we used is the notion of backward stochastic differential equations with jumps.,0
"We suggest a physical mechanism whereby the acceleration time of cosmic rays by shock waves can be significantly reduced. This creates the possibility of particle acceleration beyond the knee energy at ~10^15eV. The acceleration results from a nonlinear modification of the flow ahead of the shock supported by particles already accelerated to the knee momentum at p ~ p_*. The particles gain energy by bouncing off converging magnetic irregularities frozen into the flow in the shock precursor and not so much by re-crossing the shock itself. The acceleration rate is thus determined by the gradient of the flow velocity and turns out to be formally independent of the particle mean free path (m.f.p.). The velocity gradient is, in turn, set by the knee-particles at p ~ p_* as having the dominant contribution to the CR pressure. Since it is independent of the m.f.p., the acceleration rate of particles above the knee does not decrease with energy, unlike in the linear acceleration regime. The reason for the knee formation at p ~ p_* is that particles with $p > p_*$ are effectively confined to the shock precursor only while they are within limited domains in the momentum space, while other particles fall into ``loss-islands'', similar to the ``loss-cone'' of magnetic traps. This structure of the momentum space is due to the character of the scattering magnetic irregularities. They are formed by a train of shock waves that naturally emerge from unstably growing and steepening magnetosonic waves or as a result of acoustic instability of the CR precursor. These losses steepen the spectrum above the knee, which also prevents the shock width from increasing with the maximum particle energy.",0
"We discuss the formation of guided modes localized at the interface separat- ing two different periodic photonic lattices. Employing the effective discrete model, we analyze linear and nonlinear interface modes and also predict the existence of stable interface solitons including the hybrid staggered/unstaggered lattice solitons with the tails belonging to spectral gaps of different types.",0
"Angelini, Pellicoro, and Stramaglia [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 60}, R5021 (1999), cond-mat/9907149] (APS) claim that the phase ordering of two-dimensional systems of sequentially-updated chaotic maps with conserved ``order parameter'' does not belong, for large regions of parameter space, to the expected universality class. We show here that these results are due to a slow crossover and that a careful treatment of the data yields normal dynamical scaling. Moreover, we construct better models, i.e. synchronously-updated coupled map lattices, which are exempt from these crossover effects, and allow for the first precise estimates of persistence exponents in this case.",0
Totally geodesically embeddings of infinitely many closed 7-manifolds into 13-dimensional positively curved closed Riemannian manifolds are constructed. The problems of computing pinching constants and existence of other totally geodesical embeddings are discussed.,0
"Factorable surfaces, i.e. graphs associated with the product of two functions of one variable, constitute a wide class of surfaces. Such surfaces in the pseudo-Galilean space with zero Gaussian and mean curvature were obtained in [1]. In this study, we provide new classification results relating to the factorable surfaces with non-zero Gaussian and mean curvature.",0
"We compute the response and the angular pattern function of an interferometer for a scalar component of gravitational radiation in Brans-Dicke theory. We examine the problem of detecting a stochastic background of scalar GWs and compute the scalar overlap reduction function in the correlation between an interferometer and the monopole mode of a resonant sphere. While the correlation between two interferometers is maximized taking them as close as possible, the interferometer-sphere correlation is maximized at a finite value of f*d, where `f' is the resonance frequency of the sphere and `d' the distance between the detectors. This defines an optimal resonance frequency of the sphere as a function of the distance. For the correlation between the Virgo interferometer located near Pisa and a sphere located in Frascati, near Rome, we find an optimal resonance frequency f=590 Hz. We also briefly discuss the difficulties in applying this analysis to the dilaton and moduli fields predicted by string theory.",0
"In a 2001 article, Fetecau and Zierep [1] considered Stokes' first problem for a second grade (SG) fluid, unaware that it had already been solved (correctly) by Puri [2] in 1984. These authors used the Fourier sine transform to obtain, what they believed to be, the exact solution of the resulting initial-boundary-value problem (IBVP). Unfortunately, due to their incorrect computation of the distributional derivative of the Heaviside function, an omission of a critical term in the subsidiary equation occurred, an elementary mistake (gracefully explained in [3]) apparently not uncommon in the literature. Therefore, the solution given in [1] is, generally speaking, incorrect.",0

"Quantum-state engineering, i.e., active manipulation over the coherent dynamics of suitable quantum-mechanical systems, has become a fascinating prospect of modern physics. Here we discuss the dynamics of two interacting electrons in a coupled quantum dot driven by external electric field. We show the two quantum dots can be used to prepare maximally entangled Bell state by varying the strength and duration of an oscillatory electric field. Different from suggestion given by Loss \QTR{it}{et al}.[Phys. Rev. A, \QTR{bf}{57} (1998) 120], the present entanglement involves the spatial degree of freedom for the two electrons. We also find that the coherent tunneling suppression discussed by Grossmann \QTR{it}{et al}.[Phys. Rev. Lett., \QTR{bf}{67} (1991) 516] persists in the two-particle case, i.e., two electrons initially localized in one dot can remain dynamically localized, although the strong Coulomb repulsion prevents them behaving so. Surprisingly, the interaction enhances the degree of localization to a larger extent compared to non-interacting case. We can call this phenomenon Coulomb-enhanced dynamical localization.",0
We compute the hyperfine splitting in a heavy quarkonium composed of different flavors in next-to-leading logarithmic approximation using the nonrelativistic renormalization group. We predict the mass difference of the vector and pseudoscalar charm-bottom mesons to be $M(B^*_c)-M(B_c)=46 \pm 15 {(\rm th)} {}^{+13}_{-11} (\delta\alpha_s)$ MeV.,0
"Fractional Chern insulators are new realizations of fractional quantum Hall states in lattice systems without orbital magnetic field. These states can be mapped onto conventional fractional quantum Hall states through the Wannier state representation (Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 126803 (2011)). In this paper, we use the Wannier state representation to construct the pseudopotential Hamiltonians for fractional Chern insulators, which are interaction Hamiltonians with certain ideal model wavefunctions as exact ground states. We show that these pseudopotential Hamiltonians can be approximated by short-ranged interactions in fractional Chern insulators, and that their range will be minimized by an optimal gauge choice for the Wannier states. As illustrative examples, we explicitly write down the form of the lowest pseudopotential for several fractional Chern insulator models including the lattice Dirac model and the checkerboard model with Chern number 1, and the d-wave model and the triangular lattice model with Chern number 2. The proposed pseudopotential Hamiltonians have the 1/3 Laughlin state as their groundstate when the Chern number C=1, and a topological nematic (330) state as their groundstate when C=2. Also included are the results of an interpolation between the d-wave model and two decoupled layers of lattice Dirac models, which explicitly demonstrate the relation between C=2 fractional Chern insulators and bilayer fractional quantum Hall states. The proposed states can be verified by future numerical works, and in particular provide a model Hamiltonian for the topological nematic states that have not been realized numerically.",0
"The Kondo effect, which originates from the screening of a localized magnetic moment by a spin-spin interaction, is widely observed in non-artificial magnetic materials, artificial quantum dots, and carbon nanotubes. In devices based on quantum dots or carbon nanotubes that target quantum information applications, the Kondo effect can be tuned by a gate voltage, a magnetic field, or light. However, the manipulation of the Kondo effect in non-artificial materials has not been thoroughly studied; in particular, the artificial creation of the Kondo effect remains unexplored. Per this subject study, however, a new route for the optical creation of the Kondo effect in the non-artificial material $p$-type semiconductor CeZn$_{3}$P$_{3}$ is presented. The Kondo effect emerges under visible-light illumination of the material by a continuous-wave laser diode and is ultimately revealed by photoinduced electrical resistivity, which clearly exhibits a logarithmic temperature dependency. By contrast, a La-based compound (LaZn$_{3}$P$_{3}$) displays only normal metallic behavior under similar illumination. The photoinduced Kondo effect, which occurs at higher temperatures when compared with the Kondo effect in artificial systems, provides a potential new range of operation for not only quantum information/computation devices but also for operation of magneto-optic devices thereby expanding the range of device applications based on the Kondo effect.",0
"We consider the pair correlation functions of both the order parameter field and its square for phase ordering in the $O(n)$ model with nonconserved order parameter, in spatial dimension $2\le d\le 3$ and spin dimension $1\le n\le d$. We calculate, in the scaling limit, the exact short-distance singularities of these correlation functions and compare these predictions to numerical simulations. Our results suggest that the scaling hypothesis does not hold for the $d=2$ $O(2)$ model. Figures (23) are available on request - email bray@v2.ph.man.ac.uk",0
"The local structure of low-lying eigenmodes of the overlap Dirac operator is studied. It is found that these modes cannot be described as linear combinations of 't Hooft """"would-be"""" zeromodes associated with instanton excitations that underly the Instanton Liquid Model.

More generally, our data suggests that the vacuum fluctuations of topological charge are not effectively dominated by localized lumps of unit charge with which the topological """"would-be"""" zeromodes could be associated.",0
"In this second research note of a series of two, we present the first near-infrared results we obtained when modeling Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Our first proceedings showed the comparison between the MontAGN and STOKES Monte Carlo codes. Now we use our radiative transfer codes to simulate the polarization maps of a prototypical, NGC 1068-like, type-2 radio-quiet AGN. We produced high angular resolution infrared (1 micron) polarization images to be compared with recent observations in this wavelength range. Our preliminary results already show a good agreement between the models and observations but cannot account for the peculiar linear polarization angle of the torus such as observed. Gratadour et al. 2015 found a polarization position angle being perpendicular to the bipolar outflows axis. Further work is needed to improve the models by adding physical phenomena such as dichroism and clumpiness.",0
"The information-theoretic definition of quantum correlation, e.g., quantum discord, is measurement dependent. By considering the more general quantum measurements, weak measurements, which include the projective measurement as a limiting case, we show that while weak measurements can enable one to capture more quantumness of correlation in a state, it can also induce other counterintuitive quantum effects. Specifically, we show that the general measurements with different strengths can impose different orderings for quantum correlations of some states. It can also modify the monogamous character for certain classes of states as well which may diminish the usefulness of quantum correlation as a resource in some protocols. In this sense, we say that the weak measurements play a dual role in defining quantum correlation.",0
"Manifold embedding algorithms map high dimensional data, down to coordinates in a much lower dimensional space. One of the aims of the dimension reduction is to find the {\em intrinsic coordinates} that describe the data manifold. However, the coordinates returned by the embedding algorithm are abstract coordinates. Finding their physical, domain related meaning is not formalized and left to the domain experts. This paper studies the problem of recovering the domain-specific meaning of the new low dimensional representation in a semi-automatic, principled fashion. We propose a method to explain embedding coordinates on a manifold as {\em non-linear} compositions of functions from a user-defined dictionary. We show that this problem can be set up as a sparse {\em linear Group Lasso} recovery problem, find sufficient recovery conditions, and demonstrate its effectiveness on data.",0

"We study the modulational stability of the nonlinear Schr\""""odinger equation (NLS) using a time-dependent variational approach. Within this framework, we derive ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the time evolution of the amplitude and phase of modulational perturbations.

The case (relevant to applications in optics and Bose-Einstein condensation) where the coefficients of the equation are time-dependent, is also examined.",0
"Robots are used in more and more complex environments, and are expected to be able to adapt to changes and unknown situations. The easiest and quickest way to adapt is to change the control system of the robot, but for increasingly complex environments one should also change the body of the robot -- its morphology -- to better fit the task at hand. The theory of Embodied Cognition states that control is not the only source of cognition, and the body, environment, interaction between these and the mind all contribute as cognitive resources. Taking advantage of these concepts could lead to improved adaptivity, robustness, and versatility, however, executing these concepts on real-world robots puts additional requirements on the hardware and has several challenges when compared to learning just control. In contrast to the majority of work in Evolutionary Robotics, Eiben argues for real-world experiments in his `Grand Challenges for Evolutionary Robotics'. This requires robust hardware platforms that are capable of repeated experiments which should at the same time be flexible when unforeseen demands arise. In this paper, we introduce our unique robot platform with self-adaptive morphology. We discuss the challenges we have faced when designing it, and the lessons learned from real-world testing and learning.",0
"In this paper, we present some theoretical work to explain why simple gradient descent methods are so successful in solving non-convex optimization problems in learning large-scale neural networks (NN). After introducing a mathematical tool called canonical space, we have proved that the objective functions in learning NNs are convex in the canonical model space. We further elucidate that the gradients between the original NN model space and the canonical space are related by a pointwise linear transformation, which is represented by the so-called disparity matrix. Furthermore, we have proved that gradient descent methods surely converge to a global minimum of zero loss provided that the disparity matrices maintain full rank. If this full-rank condition holds, the learning of NNs behaves in the same way as normal convex optimization. At last, we have shown that the chance to have singular disparity matrices is extremely slim in large NNs. In particular, when over-parameterized NNs are randomly initialized, the gradient decent algorithms converge to a global minimum of zero loss in probability.",0
"Several recent works point out that the crowd of small unobservable earthquakes (with magnitudes below the detection threshold $m_d$) may play a significant and perhaps dominant role in triggering future seismicity. Using the ETAS branching model of triggered seismicity, we apply the formalism of generating probability functions to investigate how the statistical properties of observable earthquakes differ from the statistics of all events. The ETAS (epidemic-type aftershock sequence) model assumes that each earthquake can trigger other earthquakes (``aftershocks''). An aftershock sequence results in this model from the cascade of aftershocks of each past earthquake. The triggering efficiency of earthquakes is assumed to vanish below a lower magnitude limit $m_0$, in order to ensure the convergence of the theory and may reflect the physics of state-and-velocity frictional rupture. We show that, to a good approximation, the ETAS model is renormalized onto itself under what amounts to a decimation procedure $m_0 \to m_d$, with just a renormalization of the branching ratio from $n$ to an effective value $n(m_d)$. Our present analysis thus confirms, for the full statistical properties, the results obtained previously by one of us and Werner, based solely on the average seismic rates (the first-order moment of the statistics). However, our analysis also demonstrates that this renormalization is not exact, as there are small corrections which can be systematically calculated, in terms of additional contributions that can be mapped onto a different branching model (a new relevant direction in the language of the renormalization group).",0
We provide necessary conditions for the Alexander polynomials of algebraically split component-preservingly amphicheiral links. We raise a conjecture that the Alexander polynomial of an algebraically split component-preservingly amphicheiral link with even components is zero. Our necessary conditions and some examples support the conjecture.,0
"We calculate, via spin density functional theory (SDFT) and exact diagonalization, the eigenstates for electrons in a variety of external potentials, including double and triple dots. The SDFT calculations employ realistic wafer profiles and gate geometries and also serve as the basis for the exact diagonalization calculations. The exchange interaction J between electrons is the difference between singlet and triplet ground state energies and reflects competition between tunneling and the exchange matrix element, both of which result from overlap in the barrier. For double dots, a characteristic transition from singlet ground state to triplet ground state (positive to negative J) is calculated. For the triple dot geometry with 2 electrons we also find the electronic structure with exact diagonalization. For larger electron number (18 and 20) we use only SDFT. In contrast to the double dot case, the triple dot case shows a quasi-periodic fluctuation of J with magnetic field which we attribute to periodic variations of the basis states in response to changing flux quanta threading the triple dot structure.",0
"Tilted-axis cranking calculations have been performed for multi-quasiparticle states in well deformed A$\approx$180 nuclei. In the limit of zero pairing, not only are the calculated moments of inertia substantially smaller than for rigid rotation, but also they are close to the experimental values. The moments of inertia are found to be insensitive to dynamic pair correlations.",0
"Explicit expressions for pion correlators are derived in position-space, employing Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT).

"Two primitive near Earth asteroids, (101955) Bennu and (162173) Ryugu, will be visited by a spacecraft with the aim of returning samples back to Earth. Since these objects are believed to originate in the inner main belt primitive collisional families (Erigone, Polana, Clarissa, and Sulamitis) or in the background of asteroids outside these families, the characterization of these primitive populations will enhance the scientific return of the missions. The main goal of this work is to shed light on the composition of the Erigone collisional family by means of visible spectroscopy. Asteroid (163) Erigone has been classified as a primitive object, and we expect the members of this family to be consistent with the spectral type of the parent body. We have obtained visible spectra (0.5 to 0.9 microns) for 101 members of the Erigone family, using the OSIRIS instrument at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias. We found that 87 percent of the objects have typically primitive visible spectra consistent with that of (163) Erigone. In addition, we found that a significant fraction of these objects (approximately 50 percent) present evidence of aqueous alteration.",0
"Violent relaxation is a process that occurs in systems with long-range interactions. It has the peculiar feature of dramatically amplifying small perturbations, and rather than driving the system to equilibrium it instead leads to slowly evolving configurations known as quasi-stationary states that fall outside the standard paradigm of statistical mechanics. Violent relaxation was originally identified in gravity-driven stellar dynamics; here we extend the theory into the quantum regime by developing a quantum version of the Hamiltonian Mean Field (HMF) model which exemplifies many of the generic properties of long-range interacting systems. The HMF model can either be viewed as describing particles interacting via a cosine potential, or equivalently as the kinetic XY-model with infinite range interactions, and its quantum fluid dynamics can be obtained from a generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We show that singular caustics that form during violent relaxation are regulated by interference effects in a universal way described by Thom's catastrophe theory applied to waves and this leads to emergent length and time scales not present in the classical problem. In the deep quantum regime we find that violent relaxation is suppressed altogether by quantum zero-point motion. Our results are relevant to laboratory studies of self-organization in cold atomic gases with long-range interactions.",0

"Gessel conjectured that the two-sided Eulerian polynomial, recording the common distribution of the descent number of a permutation and that of its inverse, has non-negative integer coefficients when expanded in terms of the gamma basis. This conjecture has been proved recently by Lin. We conjecture that an analogous statement holds for simple permutations, and use the substitution decomposition tree of a permutation (by repeated inflation) to show that this would imply the Gessel-Lin result. We provide supporting evidence for this stronger conjecture.",0
"In a wide class of NP models, which can be motivated through generic arguments and within SUSY, we obtain large contributions to $B^0_d$--$\bar B^0_d$ mixing, but not to $\Delta B=1$ processes. If we assume such a scenario, the solutions $\phi_d\sim 47^\circ\lor 133^\circ$ for the $B^0_d$--$\bar B^0_d$ mixing phase implied by $A_{CP}^{mix}(B_d\to J/\psi K_S)$ cannot be converted directly into a constraint in the $\rho$--$\eta$ plane. However, we may complement $\phi_d$ with $|V_{ub}/V_{cb}|$ and the recently measured CP asymmetries in $B_d\to\pi^+ \pi^-$ to determine the unitarity triangle, with its angles $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$. To this end, we have also to control penguin effects, which we do by means of the $B_d\to\pi^\mp K^\pm$ branching ratio. Interestingly, the present data show a perfectly consistent picture not only for the ``standard'' solution of $\phi_d\sim 47^\circ$, but also for $\phi_d\sim 133^\circ$. In the latter case, the preferred region for the apex of the unitarity triangle is in the second quadrant, allowing us to accommodate conveniently $\gamma>90^\circ$, which is also favoured by other non-leptonic B decays such as $B\to\pi K$. Moreover, also the prediction for BR$(K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar\nu})$ can be brought to better agreement with experiment. Further strategies to explore this scenario with the help of $B_{d,s}\to\mu^+\mu^-$ decays are discussed as well.",0
"We discuss the songlines and navigation of the Wardaman people, and place them in context by comparing them with corresponding practices in other Australian Aboriginal language groups, using previously unpublished information and also information drawn from the literature. Songlines are effectively oral maps of the landscape, enabling the transmission of oral navigational skills in cultures that do not have a written language. In many cases, songlines on the earth are mirrored by songlines in the sky, enabling the sky to be used as a navigational tool, both by using it as a compass, and by using it as a mnemonic",0
"Overconstraining the CKM unitarity triangle with precision measurements of its angles continues to test the validity of the Standard Model.

I present recent results of hadronic D decays which will improve the sensitivity of gamma/phi_3 measurements.",0
"Recently, the author and Bob Coecke have introduced a categorical formulation of Quantum Mechanics. In the present paper, we shall use it to open up a novel perspective on No-Cloning. What we shall find, quite unexpectedly, is a link to some fundamental issues in logic, computation, and the foundations of mathematics. A striking feature of our results is that they are visibly in the same genre as a well-known result by Joyal in categorical logic showing that a `Boolean cartesian closed category' trivializes, which provides a major road-block to the computational interpretation of classical logic. In fact, they strengthen Joyal's result, insofar as the assumption of a full categorical product (both diagonals and projections) in the presence of a classical duality is weakened. This shows a heretofore unsuspected connection between limitative results in proof theory and No-Go theorems in quantum mechanics.",0
"This paper presents a new context-free parsing algorithm based on a bidirectional strictly horizontal strategy which incorporates strong top-down predictions (derivations and adjacencies).

An early study of saturated 4He film flow instability is revisited in view of recent theoretical work by Hiromitsu Takeuchi et al. (arXiv:0909.2144v1 [cond-mat.quant-gas] Sept. 2009).

We show how to apply a generalization of Local control design to the problem of saturation of a spin 1/2 particle by magnetic fields in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. The generalization of local or Lyapunov control arises from the fact that the derivative of the Lyapunov function does not depend explicitly on the control field. The second derivative is used to determine the local control field. We compare the efficiency of this approach with respect to the time-optimal solution which has been recently derived using geometric methods.,0

"A master equation description of the inherent dynamics is used to calculate the frequency-dependent linear thermo-visco-elastic response functions of a glass-forming liquid. From the imaginary parts of the isobaric specific heat, isothermal bulk modulus, and isobaric thermal expansion coefficient, we define a quantity $\Lambda_{Tp}(\omega)$ with the property that $\Lambda_{Tp}(\omega)=1$ is equivalent to having a one-parameter description of the linear thermo-visco-elastic response. This provides an alternative to the well-known criterion based on the Prigogine-Defay ratio.",0
"I have assembled a diverse sample of galaxies from the literature with far-ultraviolet (FUV), optical, infrared (IR) and radio luminosities to explore the calibration of radio-derived and IR-derived star formation (SF) rates, and the origin of the radio-IR correlation. By comparing the 8-1000 micron IR, which samples dust-reprocessed starlight, with direct stellar FUV emission, I show that the IR traces most of the SF in luminous L* galaxies but traces only a small fraction of the SF in faint ~0.01 L* galaxies. If radio emission were a perfect SF rate indicator, this effect would cause easily detectable curvature in the radio-IR correlation. Yet, the radio-IR correlation is nearly linear. This implies that the radio flux from low-luminosity galaxies is substantially suppressed, compared to brighter galaxies. This is naturally interpreted in terms of a decreasing efficiency of non-thermal radio emission in faint galaxies. Thus, the linearity of the radio-IR correlation is a conspiracy: both indicators underestimate the SF rate at low luminosities. SF rate calibrations which take into account this effect are presented, along with estimates of the random and systematic error associated with their use.",0
"We analyse how the properties of galaxies in groups identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey depend on the environment. In particular, we study the relationship between galaxy properties and group mass and group-centric distance. Among the galaxy properties we have considered here, we find that the $g-r$ colour is the most predictive parameter for group mass, while the most predictive pair of properties are $g-r$ colour and $r-$band absolute magnitude. Regarding the position inside the systems, the $g-r$ colour is the best tracer of group-centric distance and the most predictive pair of properties are $g-r$ colour and spectral type taken together. These results remain unchanged when a subsample of high mass groups is analysed. The same happens if the brightest group galaxies are excluded.",0
"This paper investigates the fundamental coupling between loads and locational marginal prices (LMPs) in security-constrained economic dispatch (SCED). Theoretical analysis based on multi-parametric programming theory points out the unique one-to-one mapping between load and LMP vectors. Such one-to-one mapping is depicted by the concept of system pattern region (SPR) and identifying SPRs is the key to understanding the LMP-load coupling. Built upon the characteristics of SPRs, the SPR identification problem is modeled as a classification problem from a market participant's viewpoint, and a Support Vector Machine based data-driven approach is proposed. It is shown that even without the knowledge of system topology and parameters, the SPRs can be estimated by learning from historical load and price data. Visualization and illustration of the proposed data-driven approach are performed on a 3-bus system as well as the IEEE 118-bus system.",0
"This paper presents CCD observations of the Algol-type eclipsing binaries RZ Dra and EG Cep. The light curves have been analyzed with the PHOEBE software and Wilson-Devinney code (2003 version). A detailed photometric analysis, based on these observations, is presented for both binarity and pulsation. The results indicate semidetached systems where the secondary component fills its Roche lobe. After the subtraction of the theoretical light curve, a frequency analysis was performed in order to check for pulsations of the primary component of each system. Moreover, a period analysis was performed for each case in order to search for additional components around the eclipsing pairs.",0
"In deadline-constrained wireless sensor networks (WSNs), quality of aggregation (QoA) is determined by the number of participating nodes in the data aggregation process. The previous studies have attempted to propose optimal scheduling algorithms to obtain the maximum QoA assuming a fixed underlying aggregation tree. However, there exists no prior work to address the issue of constructing optimal aggregation tree in deadline-constraints WSNs. The structure of underlying aggregation tree is important since our analysis demonstrates that the ratio between the maximum achievable QoAs of different trees could be as large as O(2^D), where D is the deadline. This paper casts a combinatorial optimization problem to address optimal tree construction for deadline-constrained data aggregation in WSNs. While the problem is proved to be NP-hard, we employ the recently proposed Markov approximation framework and devise two distributed algorithms with different computation overheads to find close-to-optimal solutions with bounded approximation gap. To further improve the convergence of the proposed Markov-based algorithms, we devise another initial tree construction algorithm with low computational complexity. Our extensive experiments for a set randomly-generated scenarios demonstrate that the proposed algorithms outperforms the existing alternative methods by obtaining better quality of aggregations.",0
"Shape reconstruction techniques using structured light have been widely researched and developed due to their robustness, high precision, and density. Because the techniques are based on decoding a pattern to find correspondences, it implicitly requires that the projected patterns be clearly captured by an image sensor, i.e., to avoid defocus and motion blur of the projected pattern. Although intensive researches have been conducted for solving defocus blur, few researches for motion blur and only solution is to capture with extremely fast shutter speed. In this paper, unlike the previous approaches, we actively utilize motion blur, which we refer to as a light flow, to estimate depth. Analysis reveals that minimum two light flows, which are retrieved from two projected patterns on the object, are required for depth estimation. To retrieve two light flows at the same time, two sets of parallel line patterns are illuminated from two video projectors and the size of motion blur of each line is precisely measured. By analyzing the light flows, i.e. lengths of the blurs, scene depth information is estimated. In the experiments, 3D shapes of fast moving objects, which are inevitably captured with motion blur, are successfully reconstructed by our technique.",0
"The energy of plasma waves can be moved up and down the spectrum using chirped modulations of plasma parameters, which can be driven by external fields. Depending on whether the wave spectrum is discrete (bounded plasma) or continuous (boundless plasma), this phenomenon is called ladder climbing (LC) or autoresonant acceleration of plasmons. It was first proposed by Barth \textit{et al.} [PRL \textbf{115}, 075001 (2015)] based on a linear fluid model. In this paper, LC of electron plasma waves is investigated using fully nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson simulations of collisionless bounded plasma. It is shown that, in agreement with the basic theory, plasmons survive substantial transformations of the spectrum and are destroyed only when their wave numbers become large enough to trigger Landau damping. Since nonlinear effects decrease the damping rate, LC is even more efficient when practiced on structures like quasiperiodic Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal (BGK) waves rather than on Langmuir waves \textit{per~se}.",0
"For the Ising model, the spin magnetization transition is equivalent to the percolation transition of Fortuin-Kasteleyn clusters; this result remains valid also for the conventional continuous spin Ising model. The investigation of more general continuous spin models may help to obtain a percolation formulation for the critical behaviour in SU(2) gauge theory. We therefore study a broad class of theories, introducing spin distribution functions, longer range interactions and self-interaction terms. The thermal behaviour of each model turns out to be in the Ising universality class. The corresponding percolation formulations are then obtained by extending the Fortuin-Kasteleyn cluster definition; in several cases they illustrate recent rigorous results.",0
"Previous models for learning entity and relationship embeddings of knowledge graphs such as TransE, TransH, and TransR aim to explore new links based on learned representations. However, these models interpret relationships as simple translations on entity embeddings. In this paper, we try to learn more complex connections between entities and relationships. In particular, we use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn entity and relationship representations in knowledge graphs. In our model, we treat entities and relationships as one-dimensional numerical sequences with the same length. After that, we combine each triplet of head, relationship, and tail together as a matrix with height 3. CNN is applied to the triplets to get confidence scores. Positive and manually corrupted negative triplets are used to train the embeddings and the CNN model simultaneously. Experimental results on public benchmark datasets show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models on exploring unseen relationships, which proves that CNN is effective to learn complex interactive patterns between entities and relationships.",0
"Let M be a closed, oriented, n -manifold, and LM its free loop space. Chas and Sullivan defined a commutative algebra structure in the homology of LM, and a Lie algebra structure in its equivariant homology. These structures are known as the string topology loop product and string bracket, respectively. In this paper we prove that these structures are homotopy invariants in the following sense. Let f : M_1 \to M_2 be a homotopy equivalence of closed, oriented n -manifolds. Then the induced equivalence, Lf : LM_1 \to LM_2 induces a ring isomorphism in homology, and an isomorphism of Lie algebras in equivariant homology. The analogous statement also holds true for any generalized homology theory h_* that supports an orientation of the M_i 's.",0
Direct and indirect information on the top quark mass and its decay modes is reviewed. The theory of top production in hadron- and electron-positron-colliders is presented.,0
"Quantum computers promise vastly enhanced computational power and an uncanny ability to solve classically intractable problems. However, few proposals exist for robust, solid state implementation of such computers where the quantum gates are sufficiently miniaturized to have nanometer-scale dimensions. Here I present a new approach whereby a complete computer with nanoscale gates might be self-assembled using chemical synthesis. Specifically, I demonstrate how to self-assemble the fundamental unit of this quantum computer - a 2-qubit universal quantum controlled-NOT gate - based on two exchange coupled multilayered quantum dots. Then I show how these gates can be wired using thiolated conjugated molecules as electrical connectors. A qubit is encoded in the ground state of a quantum dot spin-split by the Rashba interaction. Arbitrary qubit rotations are effected by bringing the spin splitting energy in a target quantum dot in resonance with a global ac magnetic field by applying a potential pulse of appropriate amplitude and duration to the dot. The controlled dynamics of the 2-qubit controlled-NOT operation (XOR) can be realized by exploiting the exchange coupling with the nearest neighboring dot. A complete prescription for initialization of the computer and data input/output operations is presented.",0
"Let q be an odd positive integer and P \in F2[z] be of order q and such that P(0) = 1. We denote by A = A(P) the unique set of positive integers satisfying \sum_{n=0}^\infty p(A, n) z^n \equiv P(z) (mod 2), where p(A,n) is the number of partitions of n with parts in A. In [5], it is proved that if A(P, x) is the counting function of the set A(P) then A(P, x) << x(log x)^{-r/\phi(q)}, where r is the order of 2 modulo q and \phi is Euler's function. In this paper, we improve on the constant c=c(q) for which A(P,x) << x(log x)^{-c}.",0
"We study a class of Lorentz violating quantum field theories that contain higher space derivatives, but no higher time derivatives, and become renormalizable in the large N expansion. The fixed points of their renormalization-group flows provide examples of exactly """"weighted scale invariant"""" theories, which are noticeable Lorentz violating generalizations of conformal field theories. We classify the scalar and fermion models that are causal, stable and unitary. Solutions exist also in four and higher dimensions, even and odd. In some explicit four dimensional examples, we compute the correlation functions to the leading order in 1/N and the critical exponents to the subleading order. We construct also RG flows interpolating between pairs of fixed points.",0
"The normalized multiplicity moments and their relation with soft and hard processes in relativistic heavy ion collisions are analyzed in a general two-component model. It is found that, the strong fluctuations in binary collision number N_c in minimum-bias events can enhance the hard component, especially for the higher order moments. This enhancement can not be effectively described by modifying the participant number in the one-component model.",0
"The apparent discrepancy between the Rosenbluth and the polarization transfer method for the ratio of the electric to magnetic proton form factors can be explained by a two-photon exchange correction which does not destroy the linearity of the Rosenbluth plot. Though intrinsically small, of the order of a few percent of the cross section, this correction is kinematically enhanced in the Rosenbluth method while it is small for the polarization transfer method, at least in the range of (Q^2) where it has been used until now.",0
"The 4-d SU(2) lattice gauge theory is simulated in the minimal Coulomb gauge which aims to maximize the traces of all links in three directions. Fourth-direction links are interpreted as spins in a Heisenberg-like model with varying interactions. These spins magnetize in 3-d hyperlayers at weak coupling, breaking a remnant gauge symmetry, as well as the Polyakov-loop symmetry. They demagnetize at a phase transition around $\beta = 2.5$ on the infinite lattice, as determined by Binder cumulant crossings. Because $N$ symmetries are breaking on an $N^4$ lattice, the transition is unusually broad, encompassing most of the crossover region on typical lattices.",0
"A system is considered, which is subject to external and possibly fatal shocks, with dependence between the fatality of a shock and the system age. Apart from these shocks, the system suffers from competing soft and sudden failures, where soft failures refer to the reaching of a given thresh-old for the degradation level, and sudden failures to accidental failures, characterized by a failure rate. A non-fatal shock increases both degradation level and failure rate of a random amount, with possible dependence between the two increments. The system reliability is calculated by four different methods. Conditions under which the system lifetime is New Better than Used are proposed. The in uence of various parameters of the shocks environment on the system lifetime is studied.",0
"Explaining the output of a deep network remains a challenge. In the case of an image classifier, one type of explanation is to identify pixels that strongly influence the final decision. A starting point for this strategy is the gradient of the class score function with respect to the input image. This gradient can be interpreted as a sensitivity map, and there are several techniques that elaborate on this basic idea. This paper makes two contributions: it introduces SmoothGrad, a simple method that can help visually sharpen gradient-based sensitivity maps, and it discusses lessons in the visualization of these maps. We publish the code for our experiments and a website with our results.",0
"Text Classification is a challenging and a red hot field in the current scenario and has great importance in text categorization applications. A lot of research work has been done in this field but there is a need to categorize a collection of text documents into mutually exclusive categories by extracting the concepts or features using supervised learning paradigm and different classification algorithms. In this paper, a new Fuzzy Similarity Based Concept Mining Model (FSCMM) is proposed to classify a set of text documents into pre - defined Category Groups (CG) by providing them training and preparing on the sentence, document and integrated corpora levels along with feature reduction, ambiguity removal on each level to achieve high system performance. Fuzzy Feature Category Similarity Analyzer (FFCSA) is used to analyze each extracted feature of Integrated Corpora Feature Vector (ICFV) with the corresponding categories or classes. This model uses Support Vector Machine Classifier (SVMC) to classify correctly the training data patterns into two groups; i. e., + 1 and - 1, thereby producing accurate and correct results. The proposed model works efficiently and effectively with great performance and high - accuracy results.",0
"M. Krein proved in 1948 that if T is a continuous operator on a normed space leaving invariant an open cone, then its adjoint T* has an eigenvector. We present generalizations of this result as well as some applications to C*-algebras, operators on l_1, operators with invariant sets, contractions on Banach lattices, the Invariant Subspace Problem, and von Neumann algebras.",0
A quantum dot weakly coupled to two normal metal leads exhibits resonant transmission at energies equal to the energy levels of the isolated dot. A nonequilibrium current can be driven in a transport channel connected to superconducting reservoirs by a Josephson phase difference between the reservoirs. We would like to see the combined effect of the above two phenomena and study transport across a quantum dot weakly connected to two finite superconductors maintained at a phase difference. The quantum dot consists of two sites and can be connected to the superconductors in two geometrical configurations: (A)~one where both the sites are in the transport channel and (B)~the other where only one site is in the transport channel and second site sidecoupled. Both the configurations show resonant transmission for Josephson current and give qualitatively same result when the onsite energies of the two sites in the dot are equal. We show that the two configurations can be distinguished if the onsite energies of the two sites are equal in magnitude and opposite in sign.,0
Some parts of stochastic analysis on curved spaces are revisted. A concise proof of the quasi-invariance of the Wiener measure on the path spaces over a Riemannian manifold is presented. The shifts are allowed to be in the Cameron-Martin space and random. The second part of the paper presents some remarks on the anticipative integrals on Riemannian manifolds.,0
"A simple, geometrical construction is given for three-dimensional spacetimes with negative cosmological constant that contain two particles colliding head-on. Depending on parameters like particle masses and distance, the combined geometry will the that of a particle, or of a black hole. In the black hole case the horizon is calculated. It is found that that the horizon typically starts at a point and spreads into a closed curve with corners, which propagate along spacelike caustics and disappear as the horizon passes the particles.",0
"The high-energy Regge behavior of gauge theories is studied via the formalism of Analytic Multi-Regge Theory. Perturbative results for spontaneously-broken theories are first organised into reggeon diagrams. Unbroken gauge theories are studied via a reggeon diagram infra-red analysis of symmetry restoration. Massless fermions play a crucial role and the case of QCD involves the Super-Critical Pomeron as an essential intermediate stage. An introductory review of the build up of transverse momentum diagrams and reggeon diagrams from leading log calculations in gauge theories is presented first. It is then shown that the results closely reproduce the general structure for multi-regge amplitudes derived in Part I of the article, allowing the construction of general reggeon diagrams for spontaneously-broken theories. Next it is argued that, with a transverse-momentum cut-off, unbroken gauge theories can be reached through an infra-red limiting process which successively decouples fundamental representation Higgs fields . The first infra-red limit studied is the restoration of SU(2) gauge symmetry. The analysis is dominated by the exponentiation of divergences imposed by Reggeon Unitarity and the contribution of massless quarks ...",0
"We explore the possibilities of creating radiatively stable entangled states of two three-level dipole-interacting atoms in a $\Lambda$ configuration by means of laser biharmonic continuous driving or pulses. We propose three schemes for generation of entangled states which involve only the lower states of the $\Lambda$ system, not vulnerable to radiative decay. Two of them employ coherent dynamics to achieve entanglement in the system, whereas the third one uses optical pumping, i.e., an essentially incoherent process.",0
"A new method for the model-independent determination of the light-cone distribution amplitude (LCDA) of the $B$-meson in heavy quark effective theory (HQET) is proposed by combining the large momentum effective theory (LaMET) and the lattice QCD simulation technique. We demonstrate the autonomous scale dependence of the non-local quasi-HQET operator with the aid of the auxiliary field approach, and further determine the perturbative matching coefficient entering the hard-collinear factorization formula for the $B$-meson quasi-distribution amplitude at the one-loop accuracy. These results will be crucial to explore the partonic structure of heavy-quark hadrons in the static limit and to improve the theory description of exclusive $B$-meson decay amplitudes based upon perturbative QCD factorization theorems.",0
"The single spin asymmetry A_N, for large P_T single inclusive particle production in p(transv. pol.) p collisions, is considered within a generalised parton model and a transverse momentum dependent factorisation scheme. The focus is on the Sivers effect and the study of its potential contribution to A_N, based on a careful analysis of the Sivers functions extracted from azimuthal asymmetries in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering processes. It is found that such Sivers functions could explain most features of the A_N data, including some recent STAR results which show the persistence of a non zero A_N up to surprisingly large P_T values.",0
"I describe a method to separate the articles of different authors with the same name. It is based on a distance between any two publications, defined in terms of the probability that they would have as many coincidences if they were drawn at random from all published documents. Articles with a given author name are then clustered according to their distance, so that all articles in a cluster belong very likely to the same author. The method has proven very useful in generating groups of papers that are then selected manually. This simplifies considerably citation analysis when the author publication lists are not available.",0
"The development of machine learning is promoting the search for fast and stable minimization algorithms. To this end, we suggest a change in the current gradient descent methods that should speed up the motion in flat regions and slow it down in steep directions of the function to minimize. It is based on a """"power gradient"""", in which each component of the gradient is replaced by its versus-preserving $H$-th power, with $0<H<1$. We test three modern gradient descent methods fed by such variant and by standard gradients, finding the new version to achieve significantly better performances for the Nesterov accelerated gradient and AMSGrad. We also propose an effective new take on the ADAM algorithm, which includes power gradients with varying $H$.",0
"Let M be a closed compact n-dimensional manifold with n odd. We calculate the first and second variations of the zeta-regularized determinants det^\prime\Lambda and det L as the metric on M varies, where \Delta denotes the Laplacian on functions and L denotes the conformal Laplacian. We see that the behavior of these functionals denotes the conformal Laplacian. We see that the behavior of these functionals depends on the dimension. Indeed, every critical metric for (-1)^{(n-1)/2}det^\prime\Lambda or (-1)^{(n-1}/2}| det L| has finite index. Consequently there are no local maxima if n=4m+1 and no local minima if n=4m+3. We show that the standard 3-sphere is a local maximum for det^\prime\Lambda while the standard (4m-3)-sphere with m=1,2,...,4, is a saddle point. By contrast, for all odd n, the standard n-sphere is a local extremal for det L. An important tool in our work is the canonical trace on odd class operators in odd dimensions. This trace is related to the determinant by the formula det Q = TR log Q, and we prove some basic results on how to calculate the trace.",0

"We investigate the vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor associated with a massive fermionic field obeying the MIT bag boundary condition on a spherical shell in the global monopole spacetime. The asymptotic behavior of the vacuum densities is investigated near the sphere center and surface, and at large distances from the sphere. In the limit of strong gravitational field corresponding to small values of the parameter describing the solid angle deficit in global monopole geometry, the sphere-induced expectation values are exponentially suppressed.",0
"We apply a recently proposed Green Function Monte Carlo to the study of Hamiltonian lattice gauge theories. This class of algorithms computes quantum vacuum expectation values by averaging over a set of suitable weighted random walkers. By means of a procedure called Stochastic Reconfiguration the long standing problem of keeping fixed the walker population without a priori knowledge on the ground state is completely solved. In the $U(1)_2$ model, which we choose as our theoretical laboratory, we evaluate the mean plaquette and the vacuum energy per plaquette. We find good agreement with previous works using model dependent guiding functions for the random walkers.",0
Known results on two-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED_2) have been used to study the dependence of functional renormalization group equations on renormalization schemes and approximations applied for its bosonized version. It is demonstrated that the singularity of flow equations can be avoided in the optimized and power-law schemes for the bosonized model and the drawback of renormalization on bosonization is shown: it is indicated that renormalization of QED_2 possibly requires interaction terms corresponding to higher frequency modes of its bosonized version.,0
"We present a microscopic theory of single molecule magnets. From our exact single-ion spin matrix elements for four arbitrary spins, we study the single-ion anisotropy of equal spins exhibiting $T_d$, $D_{2d}$, or $C_{4v}$ molecular group symmetry. Each group generates site-dependent single-ion anisotropy. For weak anisotropy, accurate Hartree expressions for the magnetization, specific heat, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) absorption, and inelastic neutron scattering cross-section are given. For $D_{2d}$, azimuthal single-ion anisotropy leads to the observed Ni$_4$ EPR splittings.",0
"The instrumentation of real systems is often designed for control purposes and control inputs are designed to achieve nominal control objectives. Hence, the available measurements may not be sufficient to isolate faults with certainty and diagnoses are ambiguous. Active diagnosis formulates a planning problem to generate a sequence of actions that, applied to the system, enforce diagnosability and allow to iteratively refine ambiguous diagnoses. This paper analyses the requirements for applying active diagnosis to space systems and proposes ActHyDiag as an effective framework to solve this problem. It presents the results of applying ActHyDiag to a real space case study and of implementing the generated plans in the form of On-Board Control Procedures. The case study is a redundant Spacewire Network where up to 6 instruments, monitored and controlled by the on-board software hosted in the Satellite Management Unit, are transferring science data to a mass memory unit through Spacewire routers. Experiments have been conducted on a real physical benchmark developed by Thales Alenia Space and demonstrate the effectiveness of the plans proposed by ActHyDiag.",0
"In this paper a general second order semi-Markov reward model is presented. Equations for the higher order moments of the reward process are presented for the first time and applied to wind energy production. The application is executed by considering a database, freely available from the web, that includes wind speed data taken from L.S.I. - Lastem station (Italy) and sampled every 10 minutes. We compute the expectation and the variance of the total energy produced by using the commercial blade Aircon HAWT - 10 kW.",0
"In this talk we discuss an elementary derivation of the semi-classical spectrum of neutral particles in two field theories with kink excitations. We also show that, in the non-integrable cases, each vacuum state cannot generically support more than two stable particles, since all other neutral exitations are resonances, which will eventually decay.",0
"Given a projective structure on a three-dimensional manifold, we find explicit obstructions to the local existence of a Levi-Civita connection in the projective class. These obstructions are given by projectively invariant tensors algebraically constructed from the projective Weyl curvature. We show, by examples, that their vanishing is necessary but not sufficient for local metrisability.",0
"We give several examples of Douglas Algebras that do not have any maximal subalgebra. We find a condition on these algebras that guarantees that some do not have any minimal superalgebra. We also show that if $A$ is the only maximal subalgebra of a Douglas algebra $B$, then the algebra $A$ does not have any maximal subalgebra.",0
"We report on three different approaches to use hash-consing in programs certified with the Coq system, using binary decision diagrams (BDD) as running example. The use cases include execution inside Coq, or execution of the extracted OCaml code. There are different trade-offs between faithful use of pristine extracted code, and code that is fine-tuned to make use of OCaml programming constructs not available in Coq. We discuss the possible consequences in terms of performances and guarantees.",0
"A two-level atom cannot emit more than one photon at a time. As early as the 1980s, this quantum feature was identified as a gateway to """"single-photon sources"""", where a regular excitation sequence would create a stream of light particles with photon number fluctuations below the shot noise. Such an intensity squeezed beam of light would be desirable for a range of applications such as quantum imaging, sensing, enhanced precision measurements and information processing. However, experimental realizations of these sources have been hindered by large losses caused by low photon collection efficiencies and photophysical shortcomings. By using a planar metallo-dielectric antenna applied to an organic molecule, we demonstrate the most regular stream of single photons reported to date. Measured intensity fluctuations reveal 2.2 dB squeezing limited by our detection efficiency, equivalent to 6.2 dB intensity squeezing right after the antenna.",0
"Systems which incrementally create 3D semantic maps from image sequences must store and update representations of both geometry and semantic entities. However, while there has been much work on the correct formulation for geometrical estimation, state-of-the-art systems usually rely on simple semantic representations which store and update independent label estimates for each surface element (depth pixels, surfels, or voxels). Spatial correlation is discarded, and fused label maps are incoherent and noisy. We introduce a new compact and optimisable semantic representation by training a variational auto-encoder that is conditioned on a colour image. Using this learned latent space, we can tackle semantic label fusion by jointly optimising the low-dimenional codes associated with each of a set of overlapping images, producing consistent fused label maps which preserve spatial correlation. We also show how this approach can be used within a monocular keyframe based semantic mapping system where a similar code approach is used for geometry. The probabilistic formulation allows a flexible formulation where we can jointly estimate motion, geometry and semantics in a unified optimisation.",0
"Distinct entropy definitions have been used to obtain an inverse correlation between the residual size and entropy for Heavy Ion Collisions. This explains the existence of several temperatures for different residual size bins, as reported elsewhere (Natowitz et. al., 2002). HIC collisions were simulated using binary interaction LATINO model where Pandharipande potential replicates internucleonic interaction. System temperature is defined as the temperature obtained when Kinetic Gas Theory is applied to the nucleons in the participant region. Fragments are detected with an Early Cluster Recognition Algorithm that optimizes the partitions in energy space.",0
"We use the Illustris Simulations to gain insight into the build-up of the outer, low-surface brightness regions which surround galaxies. We characterize the stellar haloes by means of the logarithmic slope of the spherically-averaged stellar density profiles, alphaSTARS at z=0, and we relate these slopes to the properties of the underlying Dark-Matter (DM) haloes, their central galaxies, and their assembly histories. We analyze a sample of ~5,000 galaxies resolved with more than 5x10^4 particles each, and spanning a variety of morphologies and halo masses (3x10^11 < Mvir < 10^14 Msun). We find a strong trend between stellar halo slope and total halo mass, where more massive objects have shallower stellar haloes than the less massive ones (-5.5 \pm 0.5 < alphaSTARS <-3.5 \pm 0.2 in the studied mass range). At fixed halo mass, we show that disk-like, blue, young, and more massive galaxies are surrounded by significantly steeper stellar haloes than elliptical, red, older, and less massive galaxies. Overall, the stellar density profiles fall off much more steeply than the underlying DM, and no clear trend holds between stellar slope and DM halo concentration. However, DM haloes which formed more recently, or which accreted larger fractions of stellar mass from infalling satellites, exhibit shallower stellar haloes than their older analogs with similar masses, by up to Delta(alphaSTARS) ~ 0.5-0.7. Our findings, combined with the most recent measurements of the strikingly different stellar power-law indexes for M31 and the Milky Way, appear to favour a massive M31, and a Milky Way characterized by a much quieter accretion history over the past 10 Gyrs than its companion.",0
"We demonstrate that a measurement of the Bjorken process $e^+e^-, \mu^+\mu^-\to ZH$ in the threshold region can yield a precise determination of the Higgs boson mass. With an integrated luminosity of $100 fb^{-1}$, it is possible to measure the Higgs mass to within 60 MeV (100 MeV) for m_H=100 GeV (150 GeV).",0
We present a rotationally invariant Hirsch-Fye quantum Monte Carlo algorithm in which the spin rotational invariance of Hund's exchange is approximated by averaging over all possible directions of the spin quantization axis. We employ this technique to perform benchmark calculations for the two- and three-band Hubbard models on the infinite-dimensional Bethe lattice. Our results agree quantitatively well with those obtained using the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo method with rotationally invariant Coulomb interaction. The proposed approach is employed to compute the electronic and magnetic properties of paramagnetic $\alpha$ iron and nickel. The obtained Curie temperatures agree well with experiment. Our results indicate that the magnetic transition temperature is significantly overestimated by using the density-density type of Coulomb interaction.,0
"We report theoretical and simulation studies of phase coexistence in model globular protein solutions, based on short-range, central, pair potential representations of the interaction among macro-particles. After reviewing our previous investigations of hard-core Yukawa and generalised Lennard-Jones potentials, we report more recent results obtained within a DLVO-like description of lysozyme solutions in water and added salt. We show that a one-parameter fit of this model based on Static Light Scattering and Self-Interaction Chromatography data in the dilute protein regime, yields demixing and crystallization curves in good agreement with experimental protein-rich/protein-poor and solubility envelopes. The dependence of cloud and solubility points temperature of the model on the ionic strength is also investigated. Our findings highlight the minimal assumptions on the properties of the microscopic interaction sufficient for a satisfactory reproduction of the phase diagram topology of globular protein solutions.",0
"Quantum entanglement is among the most fundamental, yet from classical intuition also most surprising properties of the fully quantum nature of physical reality. We report several experiments performed on IBM's Quantum Experience demonstrating envariance -- entanglement assisted invariance. Envariance is a recently discovered symmetry of composite quantum systems, which is at the foundational origin of physics and a quantum phenomenon of pure states. These very easily reproducible and freely accessible experiments on Quantum Experience provide simple tools to study the properties of envariance, and we illustrate this for several cases with """"quantum universes"""" consisting of up to five qubits.",0
"This paper considers a dynamic coverage problem for sensor networks that are sufficiently dense but not localized. Only a small fraction of sensors may be in an awake state at any given time. The goal is to find a decentralized protocol for establishing dynamic, sweeping barriers of awake-state sensors. Following Baryshnikov-Coffman-Kwak, we use network cyclic cellular automata to generate waves. This paper gives a rigorous analysis of network-based cyclic cellular automata in the context of a system of narrow hallways and shows that waves of awake-state nodes turn corners and automatically solve pusuit/evasion-type problems without centralized coordination. As a corollary of this work, we unearth some interesting topological interpretations of features previously observed in cyclic cellular automata (CCA). By considering CCA over networks and completing to simplicial complexes, we induce dynamics on the higher-dimensional complex. In this setting, waves are seen to be generated by topological defects with a nontrivial degree (or winding number). The simplicial complex has the topological type of the underlying map of the workspace (a subset of the plane), and the resulting waves can be classified cohomologically. This allows one to """"program"""" pulses in the sensor network according to cohomology class. We give a realization theorem for such pulse waves.",0
"At frequencies close to 1 GHz the sky diffuse radiation is a superposition of radiation of Galactic origin, the 3 K Relic or Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation, and the signal produced by unresolved extragalactic sources. Because of their different origin and space distribution the relative importance of the three components varies with frequency and depends on the direction of observation. With the aim of disentangling the components we built TRIS, a system of three radiometers, and studied the temperature of the sky at $\nu =0.6$, $\nu = 0.82$ and $\nu = 2.5$ GHz using geometrically scaled antennas with identical beams (HPBW = $18^{\circ} \times 23^{\circ}$). Observations included drift scans along a circle at constant declination $\delta=+42^{\circ}$ which provided the dependence of the sky signal on the Right Ascension, and absolute measurement of the sky temperature at selected points along the same scan circle. TRIS was installed at Campo Imperatore (lat. = $42^{\circ}~26'$ N, long.= $13^{\circ}~33'$, elevation = 2000 m a.s.l.) in Central Italy, close to the Gran Sasso Laboratory.",0
"Homogeneous power counting in Non-Relativistic QCD (NRQCD) implies the simultaneous existence of both soft and ultrasoft gluons. In the velocity renormalization group (vNRQCD) formalism we show that operators involving soft fields interacting with heavy potential quarks can be put in a manifestly gauge invariant form by utilizing gluon and quark building blocks which contain Wilson lines, and are analogous to those used in the soft collinear effective theory. This leads to several simplifications, in particular significantly reducing the size of the operator basis, which stream-lines matching and anomalous dimension calculations at subleading order in the velocity expansion. Also, soft ghosts no longer couple via potential like interactions to the heavy quark fields, and hence do not appear until two loops. Furthermore the the color structures that appear at each order in $\alpha_s$ in the static potential are only those which should arise according to non-Abelian exponentiation. We also discuss how zero-bin subtractions clarify the role of $i\varepsilon$ terms in the heavy quark propagator poles carrying soft momenta. Even though the choice of the direction of the soft Wilson lines in our building blocks does not matter, there is still a limited set of consistent choices, and the predicted form of the eikonal poles does influence results at two-loops and beyond.",0
"Resonant x-ray scattering (RXS) experiment has been performed for the (3 0 1.5) superlattice reflection in the antiferroquadrupolar and antiferromagnetic phase of DyB2C2. Azimuthal-angle dependence of the resonance enhanced intensities for both dipolar (E1) and quadrupolar (E2) resonant processes has been measured precisely with polarization analysis. Every scattering channel exhibits distinctive azimuthal dependence, differently from the symmetric reflection at (0 0 0.5) which was studied previously. We have analyzed the results using a theory developed by Lovesey et al., which directly connects atomic tensors with the cross-section of RXS. The fitting results indicate that the azimuthal dependences can be explained well by the atomic tensors up to rank 2. Rank 3 and rank 4 tensors are reflected in the data very little. In addition, The coupling scheme among the 4f quadrupolar moment, 5d ortitals, and the lattice has been determined from the interference among the Thomson scattering from the lattice distortion and the resonant scatterings of E1 and E2 processes. It has also been established from the RXS of the (3 0 1.5) reflection that the canting of the 4f quadrupolar moments exists up to T_Q. We also discuss a possible wavefunction of the ground state from the point-charge model calculation.",0
"Approximately 3-17 percent of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) without detected rest-frame UV/optical broad emission lines (type-2 AGN) do not show absorption in X-rays. The physical origin behind the apparently discordant optical/X-ray properties is not fully understood. Our study aims at providing insight into this issue by conducting a detailed analysis of the nuclear dust extinction and X-ray absorption properties of two AGN with low X-ray absorption and with high optical extinction, for which a rich set of high quality spectroscopic data is available from XMM-Newton archive data in X-rays and XSHOOTER proprietary data at UV-to-NIR wavelengths. In order to unveil the apparent mismatch, we have determined the A$_{\rm V}$/N$_{\rm H}$ and both the Super Massive Black Hole (SMBH) and the host galaxy masses. We find that the mismatch is caused in one case by an abnormally high dust-to-gas ratio that makes the UV/optical emission to appear more obscured than in the X-rays. For the other object we find that the dust-to-gas ratio is similar to the Galactic one but the AGN is hosted by a very massive galaxy so that the broad emission lines and the nuclear continuum are swamped by the star-light and difficult to detect.",0
"In this paper, a generalized Brownian motion model has been applied to describe the relative particle dispersion problem in more realistic turbulent flows. The fluctuating pressure forces acting on a fluid particle are taken to be a colored noise and follow a stationary process and are described by the Uhlenbeck-Ornstein model while it appears plausible to take their correlation time to have a power-law dependence on the flow Reynolds number $R_e$, thus introducing a bridge between the Lagrangian quantities and the Eulerian parameters for this problem. This ansatz is in qualitative agreement with the possibility of a connection speculated earlier by Corrsin [26] between the white-noise representation for the fluctuating pressure forces and the large-$R_e$ assumption in the Kolmogorov [4] theory for the 3D fully developed turbulence (FDT) as well as the argument of Monin and Yaglom [23] and the result of Sawford [13] and Borgas and Sawford [24] that the Lagrangian acceleration is delta-function auto-correlated in the infinite-$R_e$ limit. It also provides an insight into the result that the Richardson-Obukhov scaling holds only in the infinite-$R_e$ limit and disappears otherwise. This ansatz further confirms the Lin-Reid [18] conjecture regarding the connection between the fluctuating pressure-force parameter and the energy dissipation rate in turbulence and leads to an $R_e$-dependent explicit relation between the two speculated by Lin and Reid [18]. More specifically, this ansatz provides a determination of the Richardson-Obukhov constant $g$ as a function of $R_e$, with an asymptotic constant value in the infinite-$R_e$ limit. It is shown to lead to full agreement, in the small-$R_e$ limit as well, with the Batchelor-Townsend [27] scaling for the rate of change of the mean square interparticle separation in 3D FDT, hence validating its soundness further.",0
"A transform that is universally polarizing over a set of channels with memory is presented. Memory may be present in both the input to the channel and the channel itself. Both the encoder and the decoder are aware of the input distribution, which is fixed. However, only the decoder is aware of the actual channel being used. The transform can be used to design a universal code for this scenario. The code is to have vanishing error probability when used over any channel in the set, and achieve the infimal information rate over the set. The setting considered is, in fact, more general: we consider a set of processes with memory. Universal polarization is established for the case where each process in the set: (a) has memory in the form of an underlying hidden Markov state sequence that is aperiodic and irreducible, and (b) satisfies a `forgetfulness' property. Forgetfulness, which we believe to be of independent interest, occurs when two hidden Markov states become approximately independent of each other given a sufficiently long sequence of observations between them. We show that aperiodicity and irreducibility of the underlying Markov chain is not sufficient for forgetfulness, and develop a sufficient condition for a hidden Markov process to be forgetful.",0
"The classical Galois theory deals with certain finite algebraic extensions and establishes a bijective order reversing correspondence between the intermediate fields and the subgroups of a group of permutations called the Galois group of the extension. It has been the dream of many mathematicians at the end of the nineteenth century to generalize these results to systems of algebraic partial differential (PD) equations and the corresponding finitely generated differential extensions, in order to be able to add the word differential in front of any classical statement. The achievement of the Picard-Vessiot theory by E. Kolchin between 1950 and 1970 is now well known. The purpose of this paper is to sketch the general theory for such differential extensions and algebraic pseudogroups by means of new methods mixing differential algebra, differential geometry and algebraic geometry. As already discovered by E. Vessiot in 1904 through the use of automorphic systems, a concept never acknowledged, the main point is to notice that the Galois theory (old and new) is mainly a study of principal homogeneous spaces (PHS) for algebraic groups or pseudogroups. Hence, all the formal theory of PD equations developped by D.C. Spencer around 1970 must be used together with modern algebraic geometry, in particular tensor products of rings and fields. However, the combination of these new tools is not sufficient and we have to create the analogue for Lie pseudogroups of the so-called invariant derivations introduced by A. Bialynicki-Birula after 1960 in the study of algebraic groups and fields with derivations. We shall finally prove the usefulness of the resulting differential Galois theory through striking applications to mechanics, revisiting shell theory, chain theory, the Frenet-Serret formulas and the integration of Hamilton-Jacobi equations.",0
"Native contacts between residues could be predicted from the amino acid sequence of proteins, and the predicted contact information could assist the de novo protein structure prediction. Here, we present a novel pipeline of a residue contact predictor AmoebaContact and a contact-assisted folder GDFold for rapid protein structure prediction. Unlike mainstream contact predictors that utilize human-designed neural networks, AmoebaContact adopts a set of network architectures that are found as optimal for contact prediction through automatic searching and predicts the residue contacts at a series of cutoffs. Different from conventional contact-assisted folders that only use top-scored contact pairs, GDFold considers all residue pairs from the prediction results of AmoebaContact in a differentiable loss function and optimizes the atom coordinates using the gradient descent algorithm. Combination of AmoebaContact and GDFold allows quick reconstruction of the protein structure, with comparable model quality to the state-of-the-art protein structure prediction methods.",0
"We give upper and lower bounds on the information-theoretic threshold for community detection in the stochastic block model. Specifically, let $k$ be the number of groups, $d$ be the average degree, the probability of edges between vertices within and between groups be $c_\mathrm{in}/n$ and $c_\mathrm{out}/n$ respectively, and let $\lambda = (c_\mathrm{in}-c_\mathrm{out})/(kd)$. We show that, when $k$ is large, and $\lambda = O(1/k)$, the critical value of $d$ at which community detection becomes possible -- in physical terms, the condensation threshold -- is \[ d_c = \Theta\!\left( \frac{\log k}{k \lambda^2} \right) \, , \] with tighter results in certain regimes. Above this threshold, we show that the only partitions of the nodes into $k$ groups are correlated with the ground truth, giving an exponential-time algorithm that performs better than chance -- in particular, detection is possible for $k \ge 5$ in the disassortative case $\lambda < 0$ and for $k \ge 11$ in the assortative case $\lambda > 0$. (Similar upper bounds were obtained independently by Abbe and Sandon.) Below this threshold, we use recent results of Neeman and Netrapalli (who generalized arguments of Mossel, Neeman, and Sly) to show that no algorithm can label the vertices better than chance, or even distinguish the block model from an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph with high probability. We also rely on bounds on certain functions of doubly stochastic matrices due to Achlioptas and Naor; indeed, our lower bound on $d_c$ is the second moment lower bound on the $k$-colorability threshold for random graphs with a certain effective degree.",0

"In this paper Knowledge Discovery System (KDS) is proposed and implemented for the extraction of knowledge-mean stiffness of a polymer composite material in which when fibers are placed at different orientations. Cosine amplitude method is implemented for retrieving compatible polymer matrix and reinforcement fiber which is coming under predicted fiber class, from the polymer and reinforcement database respectively, based on the design requirements. Fuzzy classification rules to classify fibers into short, medium and long fiber classes are derived based on the fiber length and the computed or derive critical length of fiber. Longitudinal and Transverse module of Polymer Matrix Composite consisting of seven layers with different fiber volume fractions and different fibers orientations at 0,15,30,45,60,75 and 90 degrees are analyzed through Rule-of Mixture material design model. The analysis results are represented in different graphical steps and have been measured with statistical parameters. This data mining application implemented here has focused the mechanical problems of material design and analysis. Therefore, this system is an expert decision support system for optimizing the materials performance for designing light-weight and strong, and cost effective polymer composite materials.",0
"We derive the DGLAP and BFKL evolution equations in the N=4 supersymmetric gauge theory in the next-to-leading approximation. The eigenvalue of the BFKL kernel in this model turns out to be an analytic function of the conformal spin |n|. Its analytic continuation to negative |n| in the leading logarithmic approximation allows us to obtain residues of anomalous dimensions \gamma of twist-2 operators in the non-physical points j=0,-1,... from the BFKL equation in an agreement with their direct calculation from the DGLAP equation. Moreover, in the multi-color limit of the N=4 model the BFKL and DGLAP dynamics in the leading logarithmic approximation is integrable for an arbitrary number of particles. In the next-to-leading approximation the holomorphic separability of the Pomeron hamiltonian is violated, but the corresponding Bethe-Salpeter kernel has the property of a hermitian separability. The main singularities of anomalous dimensions \gamma at j=-r obtained from the BFKL and DGLAP equations in the next-to-leading approximation coincide but our accuracy is not enough to verify an agreement for residues of subleading poles.",0
"The collision channel without feedback (CCw/oFB) model introduced by Massey and Mathys, depicts a scenario in which M users share a thermal noise-free communication channel with random relative time offsets among their clocks. This paper considers an extension of this model, which allows the receiver to use successive interference cancellation (SIC) to iteratively cancel the interference caused by those collided packets that have been decoded by the receiver. As the main result of this paper, we derive the zero-error capacity region of this channel in the slot-synchronous case, and present a zero-error capacity achieving scheme by joint protocol sequences and channel coding design. It is shown that the negative impact on the zero-error capacity due to a lack of time synchronization can be removed by the help of SIC. Moreover, we characterize the protocol sequences that can be used to achieve zero-error capacity 1 [packets/slot] by proving new results on shift-invariant sequences and throughput-invariant sequences; these sequences have been known to achieve zero-error capacity for the basic CCw/oFB model without SIC. This characterization sheds light on the minimum sequence period required in order to attain zero-error capacity 1.",0
"Let $\mathsf{A}=\{a_1,\dots,a_m\}$, $m\in\mathbb{N}$, be measurable functions on a measurable space $(\mathcal{X},\mathfrak{A})$. If $\mu$ is a positive measure on $(\mathcal{X},\mathfrak{A})$ such that $\int a_i d\mu<\infty$ for all $i$, then the sequence $(\int a_1 d\mu,\dots,\int a_m d\mu)$ is called a moment sequence. By Richter's Theorem each moment sequence has a $k$-atomic representing measure with $k\leq m$. The set $\mathcal{S}_\mathsf{A}$ of all moment sequences is the moment cone. The aim of this paper is to analyze the various structures of the moment cone. The main results concern the facial structure (exposed faces, facial dimensions) and lower and upper bounds of the Carath\'eodory number (that is, the smallest number of atoms which suffices for all moment sequences) of the convex cone $\mathcal{S}_{\mathcal{A}}$. In the case when $\mathcal{X}\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ and $a_i\in C^1(\mathcal{X},\mathbb{R})$, the differential structure of the moment map and regularity/singularity properties of moment sequences are analyzed. The maximal mass problem is considered and some applications to other problems are sketched.",0
"Power consumption has emerged as a primary design constraint for integrated circuits (ICs). In the Nano meter technology regime, leakage power has become a major component of total power. Full adder is the basic functional unit of an ALU. The power consumption of a processor is lowered by lowering the power consumption of an ALU, and the power consumption of an ALU can be lowered by lowering the power consumption of Full adder. So the full adder designs with low power characteristics are becoming more popular these days. This proposed work illustrates the design of the low-power less transistor full adder designs using cadence tool and virtuoso platform, the entire simulations have been done on 180nm single n-well CMOS bulk technology, in virtuoso platform of cadence tool with the supply voltage 1.8V and frequency of 100MHz. These circuits consume less power with maximum (6T design)of 93.1% power saving compare to conventional 28T design and 80.2% power saving compare to SERF design without much delay degradation. The proposed circuit exploits the advantage of GDI technique and pass transistor logic",0
"As one of the latest beamline built at the SOLEIL synchrotron source, ANTARES beamline offers a spectroscopic non-destructive nano-probe to study advanced materials.

We present here the main conceptual design of the beamline and endstation, together with some of the firsts commissioning results.",0
Being able to quantify the level of coherent control in a proposed device implementing a quantum information processor (QIP) is an important task for both comparing different devices and assessing a device's prospects with regards to achieving fault-tolerant quantum control. We implement in a liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance QIP the randomized benchmarking protocol presented by Knill et al (PRA 77: 012307 (2008)). We report an error per randomized $\frac{\pi}{2}$ pulse of $1.3 \pm 0.1 \times 10^{-4}$ with a single qubit QIP and show an experimentally relevant error model where the randomized benchmarking gives a signature fidelity decay which is not possible to interpret as a single error per gate. We explore and experimentally investigate multi-qubit extensions of this protocol and report an average error rate for one and two qubit gates of $4.7 \pm 0.3 \times 10^{-3}$ for a three qubit QIP. We estimate that these error rates are still not decoherence limited and thus can be improved with modifications to the control hardware and software.,0
We discuss the phase diagram of fluid confined in AFM-like geometry. It combines the properties of capillary condensation and complete filling of a wedge.,0
"Keeping single-qubit quantum coherence above some threshold value not far below unity is a prerequisite for fault-tolerant quantum error correction (QEC). We study the initial dephasing of solid-state qubits in the independent-boson model, which describes well recent experiments on quantum dot (QD) excitons both in bulk and in substrates of reduced geometry such as nanotubes. Using explicit expressions for the exact coherence dynamics, a minimal QEC rate is identified in terms of the error threshold, temperature, and qubit-environment coupling strength. This allows us to systematically study the benefit of a current trend towards substrates with reduced dimensions.",0
"We introduce Schroedinger Eigenmaps, a new semi-supervised manifold learning and recovery technique. This method is based on an implementation of graph Schroedinger operators with appropriately constructed barrier potentials as carriers of labeled information.

"We present improved methods of using structured SVMs in a large-scale hierarchical classification problem, that is when labels are leaves, or sets of leaves, in a tree or a DAG. We examine the need to normalize both the regularization and the margin and show how doing so significantly improves performance, including allowing achieving state-of-the-art results where unnormalized structured SVMs do not perform better than flat models. We also describe a further extension of hierarchical SVMs that highlight the connection between hierarchical SVMs and matrix factorization models.",0
"In many real growing networks the mean number of connections per vertex increases with time. The Internet, the Word Wide Web, collaboration networks, and many others display this behavior. Such a growth can be called {\em accelerated}. We show that this acceleration influences distribution of connections and may determine the structure of a network. We discuss general consequences of the acceleration and demonstrate its features applying simple illustrating examples. In particular, we show that the accelerated growth fairly well explains the structure of the Word Web (the network of interacting words of human language). Also, we use the models of the accelerated growth of networks to describe a wealth condensation transition in evolving societies.",0
"Most existing Neural Machine Translation models use groups of characters or whole words as their unit of input and output. We propose a model with a hierarchical char2word encoder, that takes individual characters both as input and output. We first argue that this hierarchical representation of the character encoder reduces computational complexity, and show that it improves translation performance. Secondly, by qualitatively studying attention plots from the decoder we find that the model learns to compress common words into a single embedding whereas rare words, such as names and places, are represented character by character.",0
"We investigate the impact of a regulation policy imposed on an agent exploiting a possibly renewable natural resource. We adopt a principal-agent model in which the Principal looks for a contract, i.e. taxes/compensations, leading the Agent to a certain level of exploitation. For a given contract, we first describe the Agent's optimal harvest using the BSDE theory. Under regularity and boundedness assumptions on the coefficients, we express almost optimal contracts as solutions to HJB equations. We then extend the result to coefficients with less regularity and logistic dynamics for the natural resource. We end by numerical examples to illustrate the impact of the regulation in our model.",0
"We compute the dimension of the center of the 0-Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}_n$ and of the Nilcoxeter algebra $\mathcal{NC}_n$ using a calculus of diagrams on the M\""""{o}bius band. In the case of the Nilcoxeter algebra, this calculus is shown to produce a basis for $Z(\mathcal{NC}_n)$ and the table of multiplication in this basis is shown to be trivial. We conjecture that a basis for $Z(\mathcal{H}_n)$ can also be obtained in a specific way from this topological calculus.",0
"Many real-world systems are characterized by stochastic dynamical rules where a complex network of interactions among individual elements probabilistically determines their state. Even with full knowledge of the network structure and of the stochastic rules, the ability to predict system configurations is generally characterized by a large uncertainty. Selecting a fraction of the nodes and observing their state may help to reduce the uncertainty about the unobserved nodes. However, choosing these points of observation in an optimal way is a highly nontrivial task, depending on the nature of the stochastic process and on the structure of the underlying interaction pattern. In this paper, we introduce a computationally efficient algorithm to determine quasioptimal solutions to the problem. The method leverages network sparsity to reduce computational complexity from exponential to almost quadratic, thus allowing the straightforward application of the method to mid-to-large-size systems. Although the method is exact only for equilibrium stochastic processes defined on trees, it turns out to be effective also for out-of-equilibrium processes on sparse loopy networks.",0
"The standard electroweak theory is tested at non-trivial quantum correction level through $\alpha$, $G_F$ and the latest data of the weak-boson masses. The improved-Born approximation and the non-decoupling top-quark effects are studied without depending on the CDF data of $m_t$, while the bosonic effects are examined by fully taking account of it.",0
"Electrostatic waves in a collision-free unmagnetized plasma of electrons with fixed ions are investigated for electron equilibrium velocity distribution functions that deviate slightly from Maxwellian. Of interest are undamped waves that are the small amplitude limit of nonlinear excitations, such as electron acoustic waves (EAWs). A deviation consisting of a small plateau, a region with zero velocity derivative over a width that is a very small fraction of the electron thermal speed, is shown to give rise to new undamped modes, which here are named {\it corner modes}. The presence of the plateau turns off Landau damping and allows oscillations with phase speeds within the plateau. These undamped waves are obtained in a wide region of the $(k,\omega_{_R})$ plane ($\omega_{_R}$ being the real part of the wave frequency and $k$ the wavenumber), away from the well-known `thumb curve' for Langmuir waves and EAWs based on the Maxwellian. Results of nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson simulations that corroborate the existence of these modes are described. It is also shown that deviations caused by fattening the tail of the distribution shift roots off of the thumb curve toward lower $k$-values and chopping the tail shifts them toward higher $k$-values. In addition, a rule of thumb is obtained for assessing how the existence of a plateau shifts roots off of the thumb curve. Suggestions are made for interpreting experimental observations of electrostatic waves, such as recent ones in nonneutral plasmas.",0
The features of the $IV$ characteristics of metallic carbon nanotubes (m-NTs) in different experimental setups are studied using semi-classical Boltzmann transport equation together with the heat dissipation equation to account for significant thermal effects at high electric bias. Our model predicts that the shape of the m-NT characteristics is basically controlled by heat removal mechanisms. In particular we show that the onset of negative differential resistance in free standing nanotubes finds its origins in strong transport nonlinearities associated with poor heat removal unlike in substrate-supported nanotubes.,0
"Existence of amplitude independent frequencies of oscillation is an unusual property for a nonlinear oscillator. We find that a class of N coupled nonlinear Li\'enard type oscillators exhibit this interesting property. We show that a specific subset can be explicitly solved from which we demonstrate the existence of periodic and quasiperiodic solutions. Another set of $N$-coupled nonlinear oscillators, possessing the amplitude independent nature of frequencies, is almost integrable in the sense that the system can be reduced to a single nonautonomous first order scalar differential equation which can be easily integrated numerically.",0
"Owing to its longevity and enormous information density, DNA, the molecule encoding biological information, has emerged as a promising archival storage medium. However, due to technological constraints, data can only be written onto many short DNA molecules that are stored in an unordered way, and can only be read by sampling from this DNA pool. Moreover, imperfections in writing (synthesis), reading (sequencing), storage, and handling of the DNA, in particular amplification via PCR, lead to a loss of DNA molecules and induce errors within the molecules. In order to design DNA storage systems, a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the errors and the loss of molecules is crucial. In this paper, we characterize those error probabilities by analyzing data from our own experiments as well as from experiments of two different groups. We find that errors within molecules are mainly due to synthesis and sequencing, while imperfections in handling and storage lead to a significant loss of sequences. The aim of our study is to help guide the design of future DNA data storage systems by providing a quantitative and qualitative understanding of the DNA data storage channel.",0
"The effects of small relativistic corrections to the off-resonant polarizability, hyperpolarizability, and second hyperpolarizability are investigated. Corrections to linear and nonlinear optical coefficients are demonstrated in the three-level ansatz, which includes corrections to the Kuzyk limits when scaled to semi-relativistic energies. It is also shown that the maximum value of the hyperpolarizability is more sensitive than the maximum polarizability or second hyperpolarizability to lowest-order relativistic corrections. These corrections illustrate how the intrinsic nonlinear-optical response is affected at semi-relativistic energies.",0
"Let $Y$ be a hyperbolic surface and let $\phi$ be a Laplacian eigenfunction having eigenvalue $-1/4-\tau^2$ with $\tau>0$. Let $N(\phi)$ be the set of nodal lines of $\phi$. For a fixed analytic curve $\gamma$ of finite length, we study the number of intersections between $N(\phi)$ and $\gamma$ in terms of $\tau$. When $Y$ is compact and $\gamma$ a geodesic circle, or when $Y$ has finite volume and $\gamma$ is a closed horocycle, we prove that $\gamma$ is """"good"""" in the sense of [TZ]. As a result, we obtain that the number of intersections between $N(\phi)$ and $\gamma$ is $O(\tau)$. This bound is sharp.",0
"We construct a model with a SU(3) X U(1) horizontal symmetry in the context of Grand Unified Theories. In our models, the bi-maximal lepton mixing and suitable neutrino masses for the large angle MSW solution are obtained without any fine-tuning due to the spontaneously broken SU(3)_H symmetry. The three generations of quarks and leptons are unified as members of the SU(3)_H fundamental representation, and the U(1)_H charge gives the origin of the fermion mass hierarchy and mixing angles. We present two explicit examples of SU(5)_GUT and SO(10)_GUT models, in which the Yukawa structures are given successfully.",0
"We compute the center of the ring of PD differential operators on a smooth variety over $\bZ/p^n\bZ$ confirming a conjecture of Kaledin. More generally, given an associative algebra $A_0$ over $\bF_p$ and its flat deformation $A_n$ over $\bZ/p^{n+1}\bZ$ we prove that under a certain non-degeneracy condition the center of $A_n$ is isomorphic to the ring of length $n+1$ Witt vectors over the center of $A_0$.",0
"In a number of previous papers, local (coarse grid) multiscale model reduction techniques are developed using a Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method. In these approaches, multiscale basis functions are constructed using local snapshot spaces, where a snapshot space is a large space that represents the solution behavior in a coarse block. In a number of applications (e.g., those discussed in the paper), one may have a sparsity in the snapshot space for an appropriate choice of a snapshot space. More precisely, the solution may only involve a portion of the snapshot space. In this case, one can use sparsity techniques to identify multiscale basis functions. In this paper, we consider two such sparse local multiscale model reduction approaches. In the first approach (which is used for parameter-dependent multiscale PDEs), we use local minimization techniques, such as sparse POD, to identify multiscale basis functions, which are sparse in the snapshot space. These minimization techniques use $l_1$ minimization to find local multiscale basis functions, which are further used for finding the solution. In the second approach (which is used for the Helmholtz equation), we directly apply $l_1$ minimization techniques to solve the underlying PDEs. This approach is more expensive as it involves a large snapshot space; however, in this example, we can not identify a local minimization principle, such as local generalized SVD.",0
"This paper studies multistep methods for the integration of reversible dynamical systems, with particular emphasis on the planar Kepler problem. It has previously been shown by Cano & Sanz-Serna that reversible linear multisteps for first-order differential equations are generally unstable. Here, we report on a subset of these methods -- the zero-growth methods -- that evade these instabilities. We provide an algorithm for identifying these rare methods. We find and study all zero-growth, reversible multisteps with six or fewer steps. This select group includes two well-known second-order multisteps (the trapezoidal and explicit midpoint methods), as well as three new fourth-order multisteps -- one of which is explicit. Variable timesteps can be readily implemented without spoiling the reversibility. Tests on Keplerian orbits show that these new reversible multisteps work well on orbits with low or moderate eccentricity, although at least 100 steps/radian are required for stability.",0
"The K20 survey is a near infrared-selected, deep (Ks < 20) redshift survey targeting galaxies in two independent regions of the sky, the CDFS and the q0055-2659 field. The total Ks-selected sample includes 545 objects. Optical spectra for 525 of them have been obtained, providing 501 spectroscopic identifications (including 12 type-1 AGN and 45 stars). This paper describes the final K20 spectroscopic catalogue, along with the technique used to determine redshifts, measure the spectral features and characterize the spectra. The classification of the galaxy spectra has been performed according to a simple parametric recipe that uses the equivalent widths of the two main emission lines (O[II] and Halpha+[N II]) and two continuum indices (the 4000A break index, and a near-UV color index, C(28-39)). We defined three main spectroscopic classes: red early-type galaxies, blue emission-line galaxies and the intermediate galaxies, which show emission lines but a red continuum. More than 95% of the examined galaxies is included in one of these spectral types and a composite spectrum is built for each of the three galaxy classes. The blue emission-line and the early-type galaxies have been divided in redshift bins, and the corresponding composite spectra have been built, in order to investigate the evolution of the spectral properties of the K20 galaxies with redshift.",0
"We consider hyper- and superelliptic equations $f(x)=by^m$ with unknowns x,y from the ring of S-integers of a given number field K. Here, f is a polynomial with S-integral coefficients of degree n with non-zero discriminant and b is a non-zero S-integer. Assuming that n>2 if m=2 or n>1 if m>2, we give completely explicit upper bounds for the heights of the solutions x,y in terms of the heights of f and b, the discriminant of K, and the norms of the prime ideals in S. Further, we give a completely explicit bound C such that $f(x)=by^m$ has no solutions in S-integers x,y if m>C, except if y is 0 or a root of unity. We will apply these results in another paper where we consider hyper- and superelliptic equations with unknowns taken from an arbitrary finitely generated integral domain of characteristic 0.",0
"The method recently developed to include Van der Waals interactions in the Density Functional Theory by using the Maximally-Localized Wannier functions, is improved and extended to the case of atoms and fragments weakly bonded (physisorbed) to metal and semimetal surfaces, thus opening the way to realistic simulations of surface-physics processes, where Van der Waals interactions play a key role. Successful applications to the case of Ar on graphite and on the Al(100) surface, and of the H2 molecule on Al(100) are presented.",0
"In the CP-invariant supersymmetric theories, the steep S-wave (slow P-wave) rise of the cross section for any non-diagonal neutralino pair production in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation, $e^+e^- \to \tilde{\chi}^0_i \tilde{\chi}^0_j$ ($i \neq j$), near threshold is accompanied by the slow P-wave (steep S-wave) decrease of the fermion invariant mass distribution of the 3-body neutralino decay, $\tilde{\chi}^0_i \to \tilde{\chi}^0_j f\bar{f}$ ($f=l$ or $q$), near the end point. These selection rules, unique to the neutralino system due to its Majorana nature, guarantee that the observation of simultaneous sharp S-wave excitations of the production cross section near threshold and the lepton and quark invariant mass distribution near the end point is a qualitative, unambiguous evidence for CP violation in the neutralino system.",0
"We construct integrability preserving boundary conditions for Green-Schwarz sigma-models on semi-symmetric spaces. The boundary conditions are expressed as gluing conditions of the flat-connection, using an involutive metric preserving automorphism. We show that the boundary conditions preserve half of the space-time supersymmetry and an infinite set of conserved charges. We find integrable D-brane configurations for AdS_5 x S^5 and AdS_4 x CP^3 backgrounds.",0
"We revisit the two-field mimetic gravity model with shift symmetries recently proposed in the literature, especially the problems of degrees of freedom and stabilities. We first study the model at the linear cosmological perturbation level by quadratic Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations. We show that there are actually two (instead of one) scalar degrees of freedom in this model in addition to two tensor modes. We then push on the study to the full non-linear level in terms of the Hamiltonian analysis, and confirm our result from the linear perturbation theory. We also consider the case where the kinetic terms of the two mimetic scalar fields have opposite signs in the constraint equation. We point out that in this case the model always suffers from the ghost instability problem.",0
"We use computational approaches to explore the role of a high-refractive-index dielectric TiO2 grating with deep subwavelength thickness on InSb as a tunable coupler for THz surface plasmons. We find a series of resonances as the grating couples a normally-incident THz wave to standing surface plasmon waves on both thin and thick InSb layers. In a marked contrast with previously-explored metallic gratings, we observe the emergence of a much stronger additional resonance. The mechanism of this giant plasmonic resonance is well interpreted by the dispersion of surface plasmon excited in the air\TiO2\InSb trilayer system. We demonstrate that both the frequency and the intensity of the giant resonance can be tuned by varying dielectric grating parameters, providing more flexible tunability than metallic gratings. The phase and amplitude of the normally-incident THz wave are spatially modulated by the dielectric grating to optimize the surface plasmon excitation. The giant surface plasmon resonance gives rise to strong enhancement of the electric field above the grating structure, which can be useful in sensing and spectroscopy applications.",0
"The aim of this paper is to generalize the well-known asymptotic shape result for first-passage percolation on $\Zd$ to first-passage percolation on a random environment given by the infinite cluster of a supercritical Bernoulli percolation model. We prove the convergence of the renormalized set of wet points to a deterministic shape that does not depend on the random environment. As a special case of the previous result, we obtain an asymptotic shape theorem for the chemical distance in supercritical Bernoulli percolation. We also prove a flat edge result. Some various examples are also given.",0
"We show that if 2^{aleph_0} Cohen reals are added to the universe, then for every reduced non-free torsion-free abelian group A of cardinality less than the continuum, there is a prime p so that Ext_p(A, Z) not= 0. In particular if it is consistent that there is a supercompact cardinal, then it is consistent (even with weak CH) that every coseparable group is free. The use of some large cardinal hypothesis is needed.",0
"A quadrature-based finite-difference lattice Boltzmann model is developed that is suitable for simulating relativistic flows of massless particles. We briefly review the relativistc Boltzmann equation and present our model. The quadrature is constructed such that the stress-energy tensor is obtained as a second order moment of the distribution function. The results obtained with our model are presented for a particular instance of the Riemann problem (the Sod shock tube). We show that the model is able to accurately capture the behavior across the whole domain of relaxation times, from the hydrodynamic to the ballistic regime. The property of the model of being extendable to arbitrarily high orders is shown to be paramount for the recovery of the analytical result in the ballistic regime.",0
We show that for every conjugacy class O in a connected semisimple algebraic group G over a field of characteristic good for G one can find a special transversal slice S to the set of conjugacy classes in G such that O intersects S and dim O = codim S.,0
"Navigation is a rich and well-grounded problem domain that drives progress in many different areas of research: perception, planning, memory, exploration, and optimisation in particular. Historically these challenges have been separately considered and solutions built that rely on stationary datasets - for example, recorded trajectories through an environment. These datasets cannot be used for decision-making and reinforcement learning, however, and in general the perspective of navigation as an interactive learning task, where the actions and behaviours of a learning agent are learned simultaneously with the perception and planning, is relatively unsupported. Thus, existing navigation benchmarks generally rely on static datasets (Geiger et al., 2013; Kendall et al., 2015) or simulators (Beattie et al., 2016; Shah et al., 2018). To support and validate research in end-to-end navigation, we present StreetLearn: an interactive, first-person, partially-observed visual environment that uses Google Street View for its photographic content and broad coverage, and give performance baselines for a challenging goal-driven navigation task. The environment code, baseline agent code, and the dataset are available at http://streetlearn.cc",0
"We study the shadow of the rotating black hole with quintessential energy i) in vacuum and ii) in the presence of plasma with radial power-law density. For vacuum case the quintessential field parameter of the rotating black hole sufficiently changes the shape of the shadow. With the increasing the quintessential field parameter the radius of the shadow also increases. With the increase of the radius of the shadow of the rotating black hole the quintessential field parameter causes decrease of the distortion of the shadow shape: In the presence of the quintessential field parameter the shadow of fast rotating black hole starting to become more close to circle. The shape and size of shadow of quintessential rotating black hole surrounded by plasma depends on i) plasma parameters, ii) black hole spin and iii) quintessential field parameter. With the increase of the plasma refraction index the apparent radius of the shadow increases. However, for the big values of the quintessential field parameter the change of the black hole shadow's shape due to the presence of plasma is not sufficient. In other words: the effect of the quintessential field parameter becomes more dominant with compare to the effect of plasma.",0
"In this letter we continue the calculation of master integrals for massless three-loop form factors by giving analytical results for those integrals which are relevant for the fermionic contributions proportional to N_F^2, N_F*N, and N_F/N. Working in dimensional regularisation, we express one of the integrals in a closed form which is exact to all orders in epsilon, containing Gamma-functions and hypergeometric functions of unit argument. In all other cases we derive multiple Mellin-Barnes representations from which the coefficients of the Laurent expansion in epsilon are extracted in an analytical form. To obtain the finite part of the three-loop quark and gluon form factors, all coefficients through transcendentality six in the Riemann zeta-function have to be included.",0
The paper considers the possibility of using models with phase transition for describe the properties of digital (binary) pixel detectors without considering and taking into account the interaction between the pixels,0
"This paper presents a multi-swarm PSO algorithm for the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) implemented on OpenCL platform. Our work was motivated by results of time efficiency tests performed for single-swarm algorithm implementation that showed clearly that the benefits of a parallel execution platform can be fully exploited, if the processed population is large. The described algorithm can be executed in two modes: with independent swarms or with migration. We discuss the algorithm construction, as well as we report results of tests performed on several problem instances from the QAPLIB library. During the experiments the algorithm was configured to process large populations. This allowed us to collect statistical data related to values of goal function reached by individual particles. We use them to demonstrate on two test cases that although single particles seem to behave chaotically during the optimization process, when the whole population is analyzed, the probability that a particle will select a near-optimal solution grows.",0
"Conventional wisdom in baseball circles holds that a seven-game playoff series is fairer than a five-game series. In an earlier paper, E. Lee May, Jr. showed that, treating each game as an independent event, a seven-game series is not significantly fairer. In this paper, we take a different approach, taking home-field advantage into account. That is, we consider a given series to consist of two disjoint sets of independent events--the home games and the road games. We will take the probability of winning a given road game to be different from the probability of winning a given home game. Our analysis again shows that a seven-game series is not significantly fairer.",0
"Brain function is organized in coordinated modes of spatio-temporal activity (functional networks) exhibiting an intrinsic baseline structure with variations under different experimental conditions. Existing approaches for uncovering such network structures typically do not explicitly model shared and differential patterns across networks, thus potentially reducing the detection power. We develop an integrative modeling approach for jointly modeling multiple brain networks across experimental conditions. The proposed Bayesian Joint Network Learning approach develops flexible priors on the edge probabilities involving a common intrinsic baseline structure and differential effects specific to individual networks. Conditional on these edge probabilities, connection strengths are modeled under a Bayesian spike and slab prior on the off-diagonal elements of the inverse covariance matrix. The model is fit under a posterior computation scheme based on Markov chain Monte Carlo. Numerical simulations illustrate that the proposed joint modeling approach has increased power to detect true differential edges while providing adequate control on false positives and achieving greater accuracy in the estimation of edge strengths compared to existing methods. An application of the method to fMRI Stroop task data provides unique insights into brain network alterations between cognitive conditions which existing graphical modeling techniques failed to reveal.",0
"We propose that the Y(4260) particle recently announced by BaBar is the first orbital excitation of a diquark-antidiquark state ([cs][cbar sbar]). Using parameters recently determined to describe the X(3872) and X(3940) we show that the Y mass is compatible with the orbital excitation picture. A crucial prediction is that Y(4260) should decay predominantly in D_s D_sbar. The Y(4260) should also be seen in B non-leptonic decays in association with one kaon. We consider the full nonet of related four-quark states and their predicted properties. Finally, we comment on a possible narrow resonance in the same channel.",0
"We examine the growth of the stellar content of galaxies from z=3-0 in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations incorporating parameterised galactic outflows. Without outflows, galaxies overproduce stellar masses (M*) and star formation rates (SFRs) compared to observations. Winds introduce a three-tier form for the galaxy stellar mass and star formation rate functions, where the middle tier depends on differential (i.e. mass-dependent) recycling of ejected wind material back into galaxies. A tight M*-SFR relation is a generic outcome of all these simulations, and its evolution is well-described as being powered by cold accretion, although current observations at z>2 suggest that star formation in small early galaxies must be highly suppressed. Roughly one-third of z=0 galaxies at masses below M^* are satellites, and star formation in satellites is not much burstier than in centrals. All models fail to suppress star formation and stellar mass growth in massive galaxies at z<2, indicating the need for an external quenching mechanism such as black hole feedback. All models also fail to produce dwarfs as young and rapidly star-forming as observed. An outflow model following scalings expected for momentum-driven winds broadly matches observed galaxy evolution around M^* from z=0-3, which is a significant success since these galaxies dominate cosmic star formation, but the failures at higher and lower masses highlight the challenges still faced by this class of models. We argue that central star-forming galaxies are well-described as living in a slowly-evolving equilibrium between inflows from gravity and recycled winds, star formation, and strong and ubiquitous outflows that regulate how much inflow forms into stars. Star-forming galaxy evolution is thus primarily governed by the continual cycling of baryons between galaxies and intergalactic gas.",0
"In this short article, we prove that any automorphism of the R. Thompson's group $F$ has infinitely many twisted conjugacy classes. The result follows from the work of Matthew Brin, together with a standard facts on R. Thompson's group $F$, and elementary properties of the Reidemeister numbers.",0
We prove that the electronic densities of atomic and molecular eigenfunctions are real analytic in ${\mathbb R}^3$ away from the nuclei.,0
The paper focuses on the problem of learning saccades enabling visual object search. The developed system combines reinforcement learning with a neural network for learning to predict the possible outcomes of its actions. We validated the solution in three types of environment consisting of (pseudo)-randomly generated matrices of digits. The experimental verification is followed by the discussion regarding elements required by systems mimicking the fovea movement and possible further research directions.,0
"We have developed and characterized an atom-guiding technique that loads $3\times10^6$ cold rubidium atoms into hollow-core optical fibre, an order-of-magnitude larger than previously reported results. This result was possible because it was guided by a physically realistic simulation that could provide the specifications for loading efficiencies of 3% and a peak optical depth of 600. The simulation further showed that the demonstrated loading efficiency is limited solely by the geometric overlap of the atom cloud and the optical guide beam, and is thus open to further improvement with experimental modification. The experimental arrangement allows observation of the real-time effects of light-assisted cold atom collisions and background gas collisions by tracking the dynamics of the cold atom cloud as it falls into the fibre. The combination of these observations, and physical understanding from the simulation, allows estimation of the limits to loading cold atoms into hollow-core fibres.",0
We prove Thurston's bending measure conjecture for quasifuchsian once punctured torus groups. The conjecture states that the bending measures of the two components of the convex hull boundary uniquely determine the group.,0
"We report on the discovery of a rapidly co-rotating stellar and gas component in the nucleus of the shell elliptical NGC2865. The stellar component extends ~ 0.51/h100 kpc along the major axis, and shows depressed velocity dispersion and absorption line profiles skewed in the opposite sense to the mean velocity. Associated with it is a young stellar population with enhanced \hbeta, lowered Mg and same Fe indices relative to the underlying elliptical. Its recent star formation history is constrained by considering ``bulge+burst'' models under 4 physically motivated scenarios, using evolutionary population synthesis. Scenarios in which the nuclear component is formed over a Hubble time or recently from continuous gas inflow are ruled out. Our results argue for a gas-rich accretion or merger origin for the shells and kinematic subcomponent in NGC2865. Arguments based on stellar populations and gas dynamics suggest that one of the progenitors is likely a Sb or Sc spiral. We demonstrate that despite the age and metallicity degeneracy of the underlying elliptical, the age and metallicity of the kinematic subcomponent can be constrained. This work strengthens the link between KDCs and shells, and demonstrates that a KDC can be formed from a late merger.",0
We show that the number of prefix normal binary words of length $n$ is $2^{n-\Theta((\log n)^2)}$. We also show that the maximum number of binary words of length $n$ with a given fixed prefix normal form is $2^{n-O(\sqrt{n\log n})}$.,0
"The acceleration of the surface of last scatter (SLS) must somehow reflect the energy content within it. A test particle at the SLS is assumed to experience a linear combination of two forces: one Newtonian, the other pseudo-Newtonian describable by a cosmological constant ${\Lambda}$ in general relativity. In the ${\Lambda}$ description, which is surely too unimaginative, the size of ${\Lambda}$ reflects only the comparable magnitudes of the Newtonian and pseudo-Newtonian forces; any claim of fine tuning due to quantum mechanics is probably illusory.",0
This paper investigates a type of instability that is linked to the greedy policy improvement in approximated reinforcement learning. We show empirically that non-deterministic policy improvement can stabilize methods like LSPI by controlling the improvements' stochasticity. Additionally we show that a suitable representation of the value function also stabilizes the solution to some degree. The presented approach is simple and should also be easily transferable to more sophisticated algorithms like deep reinforcement learning.,0
"Maximizing the utility of human-robot teams in disaster response and search and rescue (SAR) missions remains to be a challenging problem. This is due to the dynamic, uncertain nature of the environment and the variability in cognitive performance of the human operators. By having an autonomous agent share control with the operator, we can achieve near-optimal performance by augmenting the operator's input and compensate for the factors resulting in degraded performance. What this solution does not consider though is the human input latency and errors caused by potential hardware failures that can occur during task completion when operating in disaster response and SAR scenarios. In this paper, we propose the use of blended shared control (BSC) architecture to address these issues and investigate the architecture's performance in constrained, dynamic environments with a differential drive robot that has input latency and erroneous odometry feedback. We conduct a validation study (n=12) for our control architecture and then a user study (n=14) in 2 different environments that are unknown to both the human operator and the autonomous agent. The results demonstrate that the BSC architecture can prevent collisions and enhance operator performance without the need of a complete transfer of control between the human operator and autonomous agent.",0
"A/B tests are typically analyzed via frequentist p-values and confidence intervals; but these inferences are wholly unreliable if users endogenously choose samples sizes by *continuously monitoring* their tests. We define *always valid* p-values and confidence intervals that let users try to take advantage of data as fast as it becomes available, providing valid statistical inference whenever they make their decision. Always valid inference can be interpreted as a natural interface for a sequential hypothesis test, which empowers users to implement a modified test tailored to them. In particular, we show in an appropriate sense that the measures we develop tradeoff sample size and power efficiently, despite a lack of prior knowledge of the user's relative preference between these two goals. We also use always valid p-values to obtain multiple hypothesis testing control in the sequential context. Our methodology has been implemented in a large scale commercial A/B testing platform to analyze hundreds of thousands of experiments to date.",0
"This technical report addresses code-based cryptography and is designed to depict the complete outline of a code based public key cryptosystem. This report includes basic mathematics and fundamentals of coding theory which are useful for studying code-based cryptography. Here, we briefly describe the first scheme of code based public key cryptosystems given by R. J. McEliece in 1978 and its improved version given by H. Niederreiter in 1986. We discuss the hard problems of coding theory which are used in code based cryptography and some classic attacks on it like information-set decoding (ISD). Successful implementation of the ISD attack on McEliece cryptosystem for some small parameters set is executed and the code for the same is provided in the Appendix. This report elaborates a key encapsulation mechanism (KEM), namely Classic McEliece, based on algebraic coding theory to establish a symmetric key for two users.",0
"A \Gamma-convergence result involving the elastic energy of a narrow inextensible ribbon is established. A non-dimensional form of the elastic energy is reduced to a one-dimensional integral over the centerline of the ribbon with the aspect ratio of the ribbon being a small parameter. That integral is observed to increase monotonically with the aspect ratio. The \Gamma-limit of the family of non-dimensional elastic energies is taken in a Sobolev space of centerlines with non-vanishing curvature. In that space, it is shown that the \Gamma-limit is a functional first proposed by Sadowsky in the context of narrow ribbons that form M\""""{o}bius bands. The results obtained here do not apply to such ribbons, since the centerline of a M\""""{o}bius band must have at least one inflection point. As a first step toward dealing with such inflection points, a result is presented on the lower semicontinuity of the Sadowsky functional with inflection points comprising a set of measure zero within the domain of an arclength parameterization.",0
"We use multi-scale modeling to analyze laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) measurements of the CO oxidation reaction over Pd(100) at near-ambient reaction conditions. Integrating density-functional theory based kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of the active catalyst into fluid-dynamical simulations of the mass transport inside the reactor chamber we calculate the reaction product concentration directly above the catalyst surface. Comparing corresponding data calculated for different surface models against the measured LIF signals we can discriminate the one that predominantly actuates the experimentally measured catalytic activity. For the probed CO oxidation reaction conditions the experimental activity is due to pristine Pd(100), possibly coexisting with other (oxidic) domains on the surface.",0
"We further develop a simple modification of Runge--Kutta methods that guarantees conservation or stability with respect to any inner-product norm. The modified methods can be explicit and retain the accuracy and stability properties of the unmodified Runge--Kutta method. We study the properties of the modified methods and show their effectiveness through numerical examples, including application to entropy-stability for first-order hyperbolic PDEs.",0
"Traditional automatic evaluation measures for natural language generation (NLG) use costly human-authored references to estimate the quality of a system output. In this paper, we propose a referenceless quality estimation (QE) approach based on recurrent neural networks, which predicts a quality score for a NLG system output by comparing it to the source meaning representation only. Our method outperforms traditional metrics and a constant baseline in most respects; we also show that synthetic data helps to increase correlation results by 21% compared to the base system. Our results are comparable to results obtained in similar QE tasks despite the more challenging setting.",0
"Massive stars having a CO core of $\sim$40-60 M$_\odot$ experience pulsational pair-instability (PPI) after carbon-burning. This instability induces strong pulsations of the whole star and a part of outer envelope is ejected. We investigate the evolution and mass ejection of metal-poor very massive stars which experience PPI. We use stellar models with initial masses of 140, 200, and 250 M$_\odot$ and the metallicity Z=0.004. Their masses decrease to 54.09, 58.65, and 61.03 M$_\odot$ before the neon-burning owing to mass-loss and He mass fraction at the surface becomes about 20%. During the PPI period of $\sim$1-2000 yr, they experience six, four, and three pulsations, respectively. The larger CO-core model has the longer PPI period and ejects the larger amount of mass. Since almost all surface He has been lost by the pulsations, these stars become Type Ic supernovae if they explode. Light curves during the PPI stage and supernovae are investigated and are implicated in luminous supernovae. The luminosity created by the interaction of different PPI ejecta becomes $M_{\rm bol} \sim -16$ to $-20$. The interaction between the circumstellar shell ejected by PPI and the supernova ejecta can be more luminous. These luminous transients could be an origin of Type I superluminous supernovae and supernovae with precursor.",0
"Bose-Fermi mixtures in one dimension are studied in detail on the basis of an exact solution. Corresponding to three possible choices of the referecce state in the quantum inverse scattering method, three sets of Bethe-ansatz equations are derived explicitly. The features of the ground state and low-lying excitations are investigated. The ground state phase diagram caused by the external field and chemical potential is obtained.",0
"In this paper, we give the first detailed proof of the short-time existence of Deane Yang's local Ricci flow. Then using the local Ricci flow, we prove short-time existence of the Ricci flow on noncompact manifolds, whose Ricci curvature has global lower bound and sectional curvature has only local average integral bound. The short-time existence of the Ricci flow on noncompact manifolds with bounded curvature was studied by Wan-Xiong Shi in 1990s. As a corollary of our main theorem, we get the short-time existence part of Shi's theorem in this more general context.",0
"We examine the evolution of an inhomogeneous mixture of non-relativistic pressureless cold dark matter (CDM), coupled to dark energy (DE) characterised by the equation of state parameter $w<-1/3$, with the interaction term proportional to the DE density. This coupled mixture is the source of a spherically symmetric Lema\^\ itre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) metric admitting an asymptotic Friedman-Lema\^\ itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background. Einstein's equations reduce to a 5-dimensional autonomous dynamical system involving quasi--local variables related to suitable averages of covariant scalars and their fluctuations. The phase space evolution around the critical points (past/future attractors and five saddles) is examined in detail. For all parameter values and both directions of energy flow (CDM to DE and DE to CDM) the phase space trajectories are compatible with a physically plausible early cosmic times behaviour near the past attractor. This result compares favourably with mixtures with the interaction driven by the CDM density in which conditions for a physically plausible past evolution are more restrictive. Numerical examples are provided describing the evolution of an initial profile that can be associated with idealised structure formation scenarios",0
A fully three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) model is applied to simulate the evolution of the large-scale magnetic field in cluster galaxies interacting with the intra-cluster medium (ICM). As the model input we use a time dependent gas velocity field resulting from 3D N-body sticky-particle simulations of a galaxy. The modeled clouds are affected by the ram pressure due to their rapid motion through the ICM in the central part of a cluster. Numerical simulations have shown that after the initial compression phase due to ram pressure a process of gas re-accretion onto the galactic disk takes place. We find that the gas re-accretion leads to an increase of the total magnetic energy without any dynamo action. The simulated magnetic fields are used to construct the model maps of high-frequency (Faraday rotation-free) polarized radio emission. We show that the evolution of the polarized intensity shows features that are characteristic for different evolutionary stages of an ICM-ISM interaction. The comparison of polarized radio continuum emission maps with our model permits to determine whether the galaxy is in the compression or in the re-accretion phase. It also provides an important constraint upon the dynamical modeling of an ICM-ISM interactions.,0
"Experimental and theoretical results are reported for single-photon single ionization of W$^{2+}$ and W$^{3+}$ tungsten ions. Experiments were performed at the photon-ion merged-beam setup of the Advanced Light Source in Berkeley. Absolute cross sections and detailed energy scans were measured over an energy range from about 20~eV to 90~eV at a bandwidth of 100~meV. Broad peak features with widths typically around 5~eV have been observed with almost no narrow resonances present in the investigated energy range. Theoretical results were obtained from a Dirac-Coulomb $R$-matrix approach. The calculations were carried out for the lowest-energy terms of the investigated tungsten ions with levels ${\rm 5s^2 5p^6 5d^4 \; {^5}D}_{J}$ $J=0,1,2,3,4$ for W$^{2+}$ and ${\rm 5s^2 5p^6 5d^3 \; {^4}F}_{J^{\prime}}$ $J^{\prime}=3/2, 5/2, 7/2, 9/2$ for W$^{3+}$. Assuming a statistically weighted distribution of ions in the initial ground-term levels there is good agreement of theory and experiment for W$^{3+}$ ions. However, for W$^{2+}$ ions at higher energies there is a factor of approximately two difference between experimental and theoretical cross sections.",0
"We present a CCD survey of variable stars in the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy. This survey, which has the largest areal coverage since the original variable star survey by Baade & Swope, includes photometry for 270 RR Lyrae stars, 9 anomalous Cepheids, 2 eclipsing binaries, and 12 slow, irregular red variables, as well as 30 background QSOs. Twenty-six probable double-mode RR Lyrae stars were identified. Observed parameters, including mean V and I magnitudes, V amplitudes, and periods, have been derived. Photometric metallicities of the ab-type RR Lyrae stars were calculated according to the method of Jurcsik & Kovacs, yielding a mean metallicity of <[Fe/H]> = -2.19 +/- 0.03. The well known Oosterhoff intermediate nature of the RR Lyrae stars in Draco is reconfirmed, although the double-mode RR Lyrae stars with one exception have properties similar to those found in Oosterhoff type II globular clusters. The period-luminosity relation of the anomalous Cepheids is rediscussed with the addition of the new Draco anomalous Cepheids.",0
"We discuss the morphology and spectrophotometry of 5 comets visible in August, 2001. We decompose comae into coma profiles and azimuthally renormalized images, in which general and local features are quantitatively comparable. Comet 19P/Borrelly showed a strong gas fan toward the solar direction, but no detectable gas in the tail. Dust in its inner coma was collimated toward the antisolar direction and the tail, with no dust in the outer coma. The contribution of spatial variations structure was moderate, about 35%. Comet 29P Schwassmann-Wachmann 1 was observed in outburst: we detected ``spinning'' jet structures. A high level of dust production resulted in an unusually high Af\rho=16600 cm. The spatial variations reached -77%, at the minimum, due in part to a jet and a ring-like structure in 1 arcminute distance from the nucleus. In comet C/2001 A2, we detected a strong post-perihelion increase of dust and gas activity, in which the C_2 profile became one magnitude brighter over a 3-day period. For comets C/2000 SV74 and C/2000 WM1, we present detailed pre-perihelion spectrophotometry and morphological information. Comet C/2000 SV74 showed high dust production (Af\rho=1479 cm). Its coma suggests a steady-state outflow of material, while the low contribution of spatial variations support high level activity. The coma of C/2000 WM1 is dominated by solar effects, and CO+ forms the bulk of its gas activity. Despite its large heliocentric distance, we observed a nice tail.",0
We have determined families of two-dimensional deterministic totalistic cellular automaton rules whose stationary density of active sites exhibits a period two in time. Each family of deterministic rules is characterized by an ``average probabilistic totalistic rule'' exhibiting the same periodic behavior.,0
"We present quasi-elastic neutrino-nucleus cross sections in the energy range from 150 MeV up to 5 GeV for the target nuclei 12C and 56Fe. A relativistic description of the nuclear dynamics and the neutrino-nucleus coupling is adopted. For the treatment of final-state interactions (FSI) we rely on two frameworks succesfully applied to exclusive electron-nucleus scattering: a relativistic optical potential and a relativistic multiple-scattering Glauber approximation. At lower energies, the optical-potential approach is considered to be the optimum choice, whereas at high energies a Glauber approach is more natural. Comparing the results of both calculations, it is found that the Glauber approach yields valid results down to the remarkably small nucleon kinetic energies of 200 MeV. We argue that the nuclear transparencies extracted from A(e,e'p) measurements can be used to obtain realistic estimates of the effect of FSI mechanisms on quasi-elastic neutrino-nucleus cross sections. We present two independent relativistic plane-wave impulse approximation (RPWIA) calculations of quasi-elastic neutrino-nucleus cross sections. They agree at the percent level, showing the reliability of the numerical techniques adopted and providing benchmark RPWIA results.",0
"Home healthcare is part of the most critical research and development healthcare areas. The objective is to decentralize healthcare, leading to a shift from in-hospital care to more advanced home healthcare, while improving efficiency, individualisation, equity and quality of healthcare delivery and limiting financial resources. In this paper, we adopt a process approach to tackle the home healthcare domain in order to highlight the importance of organisational aspects in the success of an ICT-home healthcare project. Such projects should be supported by an automated system, called in this paper, Home Healthcare support system. We examine HH processes from two selected perspectives (complexity and dynamics) to illustrate the requirements of a HH support system. We advocate that satisfying these requirements is part of the most important challenges in the home healthcare research domain and we propose first track of solutions by attempting to benefit from past experiences in 3 process research communities.",0
"In Kaluza-Klein theories of low-scale quantum gravity, gravitons and isosinglet neutrinos may propagate in a higher-dimensional space with large compact dimensions, whereas all particles of the Standard Model are confined on a (1+3)-dimensional subspace. After compactification of the extra dimensions, the resulting Yukawa couplings of the Kaluza-Klein neutrinos to the lepton doublets become naturally very suppressed by a higher-dimensional volume factor, in agreement with phenomenological observations. We show that one-loop effects induced by Kaluza-Klein neutrinos, albeit tiny individually, act cumulatively in electroweak processes, giving rise to a non-decoupling behaviour for large values of the higher-dimensional Yukawa couplings. Owing to the non-decoupling effects of Kaluza-Klein neutrinos, we can derive stronger constraints on the parameters of the theory that originate from the non-observation of flavour-violating and universality-breaking phenomena, which involve the W and Z bosons, and the e, $\mu$ and $\tau$ leptons.",0
"We compare static arbitrage price bounds on basket calls, i.e. bounds that only involve buy-and-hold trading strategies, with the price range obtained within a multi-variate generalization of the Black-Scholes model. While there is no gap between these two sets of prices in the univariate case, we observe here that contrary to our intuition about model risk for at-the-money calls, there is a somewhat large gap between model prices and static arbitrage prices, hence a similarly large set of prices on which a multivariate Black-Scholes model cannot be calibrated but where no conclusion can be drawn on the presence or not of a static arbitrage opportunity.",0
"Three dimensional FLASH magneto-hydrodynamics(MHD) modeling is carried out to interpret the OMEGA laser experiments of strongly magnetized, highly collimated jets driven by a ring of 20 OMEGA beams. The predicted optical Thomson scattering spectra and proton images are in good agreement with a subset of the experimental data. Magnetic fields generated via the Biermann battery term are amplified at the boundary between the core and the surrounding of the jet. The simulation predicts multiple axially aligned magnetic flux ropes with alternating poloidal component. Future applications of the hollow ring configuration in laboratory astrophysics are discussed.",0
"The consensus of opinion in cosmology is that the Universe is currently undergoing a period of accelerated expansion. With current and proposed high precision experiments it offers the hope of being able to discriminate between the two competing models that are being suggested to explain the observations, namely a cosmological constant or a time dependent `Quintessence' model. The latter suffers from a plethora of scalar field potentials all leading to similar late time behaviour of the universe, hence to a lack of predictability. In this paper, we develop a model independent approach which simply involves parameterizing the dark energy equation of state in terms of known observables. This allows to analyse the impact dark energy has had on cosmology without the need to refer to particular scalar field models and opens up the possibility that future experiments will be able to constrain the dark energy equation of state in a model independent manner.",0
"Recently it was found that selenium doping can suppress the charge-density-wave (CDW) order and induce bulk superconductivity in ZrTe$_3$. The observed superconducting dome suggests the existence of a CDW quantum critical point (QCP) in ZrTe$_{3-x}$Se$_x$ near $x \approx$ 0.04. To elucidate its superconducting state near the CDW QCP, we measure the thermal conductivity of two ZrTe$_{3-x}$Se$_x$ single crystals ($x$ = 0.044 and 0.051) down to 80 mK. For both samples, the residual linear term $\kappa_0/T$ at zero field is negligible, which is a clear evidence for nodeless superconducting gap. Furthermore, the field dependence of $\kappa_0/T$ manifests multigap behavior. These results demonstrate multiple nodeless superconducting gaps in ZrTe$_{3-x}$Se$_x$, which indicates conventional superconductivity despite of the existence of a CDW QCP.",0
"In this work we study the interplay between the crystal structure and magnetism of the pyroarsenate \alpha-Cu_2As_2O_7 by means of magnetization, heat capacity, electron spin resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. The data reveal that the magnetic Cu-O chains in the crystal structure represent a realization of a quasi-one dimensional (1D) coupled alternating spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain model with relevant pathways through non-magnetic AsO_4 tetrahedra. Owing to residual 3D interactions antiferromagnetic long range ordering at T_N\simeq10K takes place. Application of external magnetic field B along the magnetically easy axis induces the transition to a spin-flop phase at B_{SF}~1.7T (2K). The experimental data suggest that substantial quantum spin fluctuations take place at low magnetic fields in the ordered state. DFT calculations confirm the quasi-one-dimensional nature of the spin lattice, with the leading coupling J_1 within the structural dimers. QMC fits to the magnetic susceptibility evaluate J_1=164K, the weaker intrachain coupling J'_1/J_1 = 0.55, and the effective interchain coupling J_{ic1}/J_1 = 0.20.",0
"Protoplanetary discs are now routinely observed and exoplanets, after the numerous indirect discoveries, are starting to be directly imaged. To better understand the planet formation process, the next step is the detection of forming planets or of signposts of young planets still in their disc, such as gaps. A spectacular example is the ALMA science verification image of HL Tau showing numerous gaps and rings in its disc. To study the observability of planet gaps, we ran 3D hydrodynamical simulations of a gas and dust disc containing a 5 M J gap-opening planet and characterised the spatial distribution of migrating, growing and fragmenting dust grains. We then computed the corresponding synthetic images for ALMA. For a value of the dust fragmentation threshold of 15 m s --1 for the collisional velocity, we identify for the first time a self-induced dust pile up in simulations taking fragmentation into account. This feature, in addition to the easily detected planet gap, causes a second apparent gap that could be mistaken for the signature of a second planet. It is therefore essential to be cautious in the interpretation of gap detections.",0
"The nature and origin of the soft X-ray excess in radio quiet AGN is still an open issue. The interpretation in terms of thermal disc emission has been challanged by the discovery of the constancy of the effective temperature despite the wide range of Black Hole masses of the observed sources. Alternative models are reflection from ionized matter and absorption in a relativistically smeared wind. We analyzed XMM-Newton observations of four luminous radio quiet AGN with the aim of characterising their main properties and in particular the soft excess. Different spectral models for the soft excess were tried: thermal disc emission, Comptonization, ionized reflection, relativistically smeared winds. Comptonization of thermal emission and the smeared winds provide the best fits, but the other models also provide acceptable fits. All models, however, return parameters very similar from source to source, despite the large differences in luminosities, Black Hole masses and Eddington ratios. Moreover, the smeared wind model require very large smearing velocities. The UV to X-ray fluxes ratios are very different, but do not correlate with any other parameter. No fully satisfactory explanation for the soft X-ray excess is found. Better data, like e.g. observations in a broader energy band, are needed to make further progresses.",0
"Visual cognition of the indoor environment can benefit from the spatial layout estimation, which is to represent an indoor scene with a 2D box on a monocular image. In this paper, we propose to fully exploit the edge and semantic information of a room image for layout estimation. More specifically, we present an encoder-decoder network with shared encoder and two separate decoders, which are composed of multiple deconvolution (transposed convolution) layers, to jointly learn the edge maps and semantic labels of a room image. We combine these two network predictions in a scoring function to evaluate the quality of the layouts, which are generated by ray sampling and from a predefined layout pool. Guided by the scoring function, we apply a novel refinement strategy to further optimize the layout hypotheses. Experimental results show that the proposed network can yield accurate estimates of edge maps and semantic labels. By fully utilizing the two different types of labels, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art layout estimation performance on benchmark datasets.",0
"During an extensive multiwavelength campaign that we performed in 2013-14 the prototypical Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 5548 has been found in an unusual condition of heavy and persistent obscuration. The newly discovered """"obscurer"""" absorbs most of the soft X-ray continuum along our line of sight and lowers the ionizing luminosity received by the classical warm absorber. Here we present the analysis of the high resolution X-ray spectra collected with XMM-Newton and Chandra throughout the campaign, which are suitable to investigate the variability of both the obscurer and the classical warm absorber. The time separation between these X-ray observations range from 2 days to 8 months. On these timescales the obscurer is variable both in column density and in covering fraction. This is consistent with the picture of a patchy wind. The most significant variation occurred in September 2013 when the source brightened for two weeks. A higher and steeper intrinsic continuum and a lower obscurer covering fraction are both required to explain the spectral shape during the flare. We suggest that a geometrical change of the soft X-ray source behind the obscurer cause the observed drop in the covering fraction. Due to the higher soft X-ray continuum level the September 2013 Chandra spectrum is the only X ray spectrum of the campaign where individual features of the warm absorber could be detected. The spectrum shows absorption from Fe-UTA, \ion{O}{iv}, and \ion{O}{v}, consistent to belong to the lower-ionization counterpart of the historical NGC 5548 warm absorber. Hence, we confirm that the warm absorber has responded to the drop in the ionizing luminosity caused by the obscurer.",0
"We show how it is possible to rewrite the BFKL equation for the unintegrated gluon distribution, in terms of integrated gluons, similar to that used in DGLAP. We add to our equation the next-to-leading log terms which provide exact energy-momentum conservation and account for the kinematic constraint in real gluon emission. In this way the equation includes the major part of the higher-order corrections to BFKL evolution. We discuss the possibility to obtain a unified BFKL-DGLAP evolution equation relevant to processes at the LHC where both log(1/x) and logQ^2 are large simultaneously.",0
"Let G be a simple undirected graph on n vertices, and let I(G) \subseteq R = k[x_1,...,x_n] denote its associated edge ideal. We show that all chordal graphs G are sequentially Cohen-Macaulay; our proof depends upon showing that the Alexander dual of I(G) is componentwise linear. Our result complements Faridi's theorem that the facet ideal of a simplicial tree is sequentially Cohen-Macaulay and implies Herzog, Hibi, and Zheng's theorem that a chordal graph is Cohen-Macaulay if and only if its edge ideal is unmixed. We also characterize the sequentially Cohen-Macaulay cycles and produce some examples of nonchordal sequentially Cohen-Macaulay graphs.",0
"Given $k \geq 2$, we show that there are at most finitely many rational numbers $x$ and $y \neq 0$ and integers $\ell \geq 2$ (with $(k,\ell) \neq (2,2)$) for which $$ x (x+1) \cdots (x+k-1) = y^\ell. $$ In particular, if we assume that $\ell$ is prime, then all such triples $(x,y,\ell)$ satisfy either $y=0$ or $\log \ell < 3^k$.",0
"We prove that for every hyperbolic component of the Mandelbrot set, any two limbs with equal denominators are homeomorphic so that the homeomorphism preserves periods of hyperbolic components. This settles a conjecture on the Mandelbrot set that goes back to 1994.",0
"Let $G$ be a subgroup of the automorphism group of a commutative ring with identity $T$. Let $R$ be a subring of $T$ such that $R$ is invariant under the action by $G$. We show $R^G\subset T^G$ is a minimal ring extension whenever $R\subset T$ is a minimal extension under various assumptions. Of the two types of minimal ring extensions, integral and integrally closed, both of these properties are passed from $R\subset T$ to $R^G\subset T^G$. An integrally closed minimal ring extension is a flat epimorphic extension as well as a normal pair. We show each of these properties also pass from $R\subset T$ to $R^G\subseteq T^G$ under certain group action.",0
"We present the convergence analysis of the cell average technique, introduced in [12], to solve the nonlinear continuous Smoluchowski coagulation equation. It is shown that the technique is second order accurate on uniform grids and first order accurate on non-uniform smooth (geometric) grids. As an essential ingredient, the consistency of the technique is thoroughly discussed.",0
"In this work we report on the role of ion transport for the dynamic behavior of a double barrier quantum mechanical Al/Al$_2$O$_3$/Nb$_{\text{x}}$O$_{\text{y}}$/Au memristive device based on numerical simulations in conjunction with experimental measurements. The device consists of an ultra-thin Nb$_{\text{x}}$O$_{\text{y}}$ solid state electrolyte between an Al$_2$O$_3$ tunnel barrier and a semiconductor metal interface at an Au electrode. It is shown that the device provides a number of interesting features for potential applications such as an intrinsic current compliance, a relatively long retention time, and no need for an initialization step. Therefore, it is particularly attractive for applications in highly dense random access memories or neuromorphic mixed signal circuits. However, the underlying physical mechanisms of the resistive switching are still not completely understood yet. To investigate the interplay between the current transport mechanisms and the inner atomistic device structure a lumped element circuit model is consistently coupled with 3D kinetic Monte Carlo model for the ion transport. The simulation results indicate that the drift of charged point defects within the Nb$_{\text{x}}$O$_{\text{y}}$ is the key factor for the resistive switching behavior. It is shown in detail that the diffusion of oxygen modifies the local electronic interface states resulting in a change of the interface properties of the double barrier device.",0
"An empirical analysis on Eurodollar interest rates daily data in the time period 1990-1996, is performed and compared with Libor data in the time period 1984-1998. The complementary cumulative distributions for the daily fluctuations at different maturity dates and the Power Spectral Density are computed. We find that the probability distribution shows `fat' tails with non-Gaussian behaviours. Moreover, we study the correlations among Eurodollar interest rates fluctuations with different maturity dates. By using an original clustering linkage, we show how the collective motion of the interest rates curve can be analyzed in sub-groups of maturity dates with similar behaviours.",0
"The quantum mechanics description of a physical object stretched in space and stable in time from the relativistic space-time properties point of view, introduced in special theory of relativity, is considered and analysed. The mathematical model of physical objects is proposed. This model gives a possibility to unite a description of corpuscular and wave properties of real physical objects, i.e. fields and particles. There are substantiated an approach and a mathematical pattern which give a possibility to describe physical object not only in causal, but also in absolute remote fields of the Minkowski space. Applying the proposed approach to the microcosm description, one can get the equations that in passage to the limit transfer to such quantum mechanics equations as Schrodinger, Klein-Gordon-Fock and in particular case - the wave equation. The event nature of the received equations is discussed. It is shown that all mentioned equations reflect the space-time relativistic properties during the description of the invariant and non-invariant physics object characteristics.",0
"The problem of preserving privacy when a multivariate source is required to be revealed partially to multiple users is modeled as a Gray-Wyner source coding problem with K correlated sources at the encoder and K decoders in which the kth decoder, k = 1, 2, ...,K, losslessly reconstructs the kth source via a common link and a private link. The privacy requirement of keeping each decoder oblivious of all sources other than the one intended for it is introduced via an equivocation constraint at each decoder such that the total equivocation summed over all decoders is E. The set of achievable rates-equivocation tuples is completely characterized. Using this characterization, two different definitions of common information are presented and are shown to be equivalent.",0
"The classical theory of cluster relaxation is unsatisfactory because it involves the Coulomb logarithm. The Balescu-Lenard (BL) equation provides a rigorous alternative that has no ill-defined parameter. Moreover, the BL equation, unlike classical theory, includes the cluster's self-gravity. A heuristic argument is given that indicates that relaxation does not occur predominantly through two-particle scattering and is enhanced by self-gravity. The BL equation is adapted to a spherical system and used to estimate the flux through the action space of isochrone clusters with different velocity anisotropies. A range of fairly different secular behaviours is found depending on the fraction of radial orbits. Classical theory is also used to compute the corresponding classical fluxes. The BL and classical fluxes are very different because (a) the classical theory materially under-estimates the impact of large-scale collectively amplified fluctuations and (b) only the leading terms in an infinite sum for the BL flux are computed. A complete theory of cluster relaxation likely requires that the sum in the BL equation be decomposed into a sum over a finite number of small wavenumbers complemented by an integral over large wavenumbers analogous to classical theory.",0
"In contingency table analysis, sparse data is frequently encountered for even modest numbers of variables, resulting in non-existence of maximum likelihood estimates. A common solution is to obtain regularized estimates of the parameters of a log-linear model. Bayesian methods provide a coherent approach to regularization, but are often computationally intensive. Conjugate priors ease computational demands, but the conjugate Diaconis-Ylvisaker priors for the parameters of log-linear models do not give rise to closed form credible regions, complicating posterior inference. Here we derive the optimal Gaussian approximation to the posterior for log-linear models with Diaconis-Ylvisaker priors, and provide convergence rate and finite-sample bounds for the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the exact posterior and the optimal Gaussian approximation. We demonstrate empirically in simulations and a real data application that the approximation is highly accurate, even in relatively small samples. The proposed approximation provides a computationally scalable and principled approach to regularized estimation and approximate Bayesian inference for log-linear models.",0
"We study the spontaneous magnetization and the magnetic hysteresis using the gauge/gravity duality. We first propose a novel and general formula to compute the magnetization in a large class of holographic models. By using this formula, we compute the spontaneous magnetization in a model like a holographic superconductor. Furthermore, we turn on the external magnetic field and build the hysteresis curve of magnetization and charge density. To our knowledge, this is the first holographic model realizing the hysteresis accompanied with spontaneous symmetry breaking. By considering the Landau-Ginzburg type effective potential in the symmetry broken phase, we obtain the mass of the magnon from the bulk geometry data.",0
"We have obtained deep optical spectrophotometry of 16 planetary nebulae in M33, mostly located in the central two kpc of the galaxy, with the Subaru and Keck telescopes. We have derived electron temperatures and chemical abundances from the detection of the [OIII]4363 line for the whole sample. We have found one object with an extreme nitrogen abundance, 12+log(N/H)=9.20, accompanied by a large helium content. After combining our data with those available in the literature for PNe and HII regions, we have examined the behavior of nitrogen, neon, oxygen and argon in relation to each other, and as a function of galactocentric distance. We confirm the good correlation between Ne/H and O/H for PNe in M33. Ar/H is also found to correlate with O/H. This strengthens the idea that at the metallicity of the bright PNe analyzed in M33, which is similar to that found in the LMC, these elements have not been significantly modified during the dredge-up processes that take place during the AGB phase of their progenitor stars. We find no significant oxygen abundance offset between PNe and HII regions at any given galactocentric distance, despite the fact that these objects represent different age groups in the evolution of the galaxy. Combining the results from PNe and HII regions, we obtain a representative slope of the ISM alpha-element (O, Ar, Ne) abundance gradient in M33 of -0.025 +/- 0.006 dex/kpc. Both PNe and HII regions display a large abundance dispersion at any given distance from the galactic center. We find that the N/O ratio in PNe is enhanced, relative to the HII regions, by approximately 0.8 dex.",0
"We have carried out high-speed photometry of three chromospherically active stars, BD +15 3364, II Peg, and SAO 52355 with the Zeiss 2-m telescope, as well as low-resolution spectroscopy of SAO 52355 with the Zeiss-600 telescopes at Peak Terskol. BD +15 3364 is known as chromospherically active star of the spectral type G0. II Peg is the RS CVn binary. It has a spectral type K2IV-Ve. SAO 52355 is a field star of the spectral type K0 III. The X-ray observations taken by Ginga and ROSAT indicate in II Peg and SAO 52355 coronae plasma temperatures as high as $10^{7}$ K. These two stars are supposed to have high-powered chromospheres. Photometric observations of all three stars show high-frequency variations in brightness in the UBV bands at subsecond range. Intensity variations are found peaked at frequency around about 0.5 Hz, spanning the range up to 1.5 Hz for BD +15 3364, II Peg, and up to about 35 Hz for SAO 52355. The relative power of fluctuations reaches ($10^{-3.7} - 10^{-4.2}$) in the UBV bands. Spectroscopic monitoring of SAO 52355 showed variations of emission in the Balmer lines and in the CaII H, K lines at time intervals ranging from seconds to minutes. From the power spectrum data one can find that variations in the intensities of the CaII H, K and $H_{\gamma}$ lines are 3.2% and 1.5%, respectively. This allows us to assert the existence of intense microflaring activity in these stars.",0
"The stability of Bose-Fermi gases trapped in an isotropic potentials at ultracold temperature is strongly influenced by the interaction between the fermions and the bosons. At zero temperature, the stability criterion is given in this paper using variation method, the results show that whether a fermion-boson mixture is stable depends mainly on the interaction between the fermions and the bosons. For finite temperature, however, the stability is not only related to the coupling constants, but also to the temperature. The stability conditions for finite temperature are also derived and discuss in details in this paper.",0
"Cabibbo-allowed nonleptonic weak decays of charmed baryons $\lamc,~\xin,~\xip$ and $\Omega_c^0$ into an octet baryon and a pseudoscalar meson are analyzed. The nonfactorizable contributions are evaluated under pole approximation, and it turns out that the $s$-wave amplitudes are dominated by the low-lying $\halfm$ resonances, while $p$-wave ones governed by the ground-state $\halfp$ poles. The MIT bag model is employed to calculate the coupling constants, form factors and baryon matrix elements. Our conclusions are: (i) $s$ waves are no longer dominated by commutator terms; the current-algebra method is certainly not applicable to parity-violating amplitudes, (ii) nonfactorizable $W$ exchange effects are generally important; they can be comparable to and somtimes even dominate over factorizable contributions, depending on the decay modes under consideration, (iii) large-$N_c$ approximation for factorizable amplitudes also works in the heavy baryon sector and it accounts for the color nonsuppression of $\lamc\ri p\bar{K}^0$ relative to $\lamc\ri\Lambda\pi^+$, (iv) a measurement of the decay rate and the sign of the $\alpha$ asymmetry parameter of certain proposed decay modes will help discern various models; especially the sign of $\alpha$ in $\lamc\ri\Sigma\pi$ decays can be used to unambiguously differentiate recent theoretical schemes from current algebra, and (v) $p$ waves are the dominant contributions to the decays $\lamc\ri\Xi^0 K^+$ and $\xin\ri\Sigma^+ K^-$, but they are subject to a large cancellation; this renders present theoretical predictions on these two channels unreliable.",0
"We present here the iteration procedure for the determination of free energy $\epsilon^{2}$-expansion using the theory of KdV - type equations. In our approach we use the conservation laws for KdV - type equations depending explicitly on times $t_{1}, t_{2}, ...$ to find the $\epsilon^{2}$-expansion of $u(x,t_{1},t_{2},...)$ after the infinite number of shifts of $u(x,0,0,...) \equiv x$ along $t_{1}, t_{2}, ...$ in recurrent form. The formulas for the free energy expansion are just obtained then as a result of quite simple integration procedure applied to $u_{n}(x)$.",0
"The availability of vector magnetogram sequences with sufficient accuracy and cadence to estimate the time derivative of the magnetic field allows us to use Faraday's law to find an approximate solution for the electric field in the photosphere, using a Poloidal-Toroidal Decomposition (PTD) of the magnetic field and its partial time derivative. Without additional information, however, the electric field found from this technique is under-determined -- Faraday's law provides no information about the electric field that can be derived the gradient of a scalar potential. Here, we show how additional information in the form of line-of-sight Doppler flow measurements, and motions transverse to the line-of-sight determined with ad-hoc methods such as local correlation tracking, can be combined with the PTD solutions to provide much more accurate solutions for the solar electric field, and therefore the Poynting flux of electromagnetic energy in the solar photosphere. Reliable, accurate maps of the Poynting flux are essential for quantitative studies of the buildup of magnetic energy before flares and coronal mass ejections.",0
"The simplest unified extension of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with bilinear R--Parity violation provides a predictive scheme for neutrino masses which can account for the observed atmospheric and solar neutrino anomalies.Despite the smallness of neutrino masses R-parity violation is observable at present and future high-energy colliders, providing an unambiguous cross-check of the model.",0
"Within the framework of four dimensional conformal supergravity we consider $\mathcal{N}=1,2,3,4$ supersymmetric theories generally twisted along the abelian subgroups of the R-symmetry and possibly other global symmetry groups. Upon compactification on constant curvature Riemann surfaces with arbitrary genus we provide an extensive classification of the resulting two dimensional theories according to the amount of supersymmetry that is preserved. Exploiting the c-extremization prescription introduced in arXiv:1211.4030 we develop a general procedure to obtain the central charge for 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ theories and the expression of the corresponding R-current in terms of the original 4d one and its mixing with the other abelian global currents.",0
"Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) consisting of combinations of transcription factors (TFs) and their cis promoters are assumed to be sufficient to direct the development of organisms. Mutations in GRNs are assumed to be the primary drivers for the evolution of multicellular life. Here it is proven that neither of these assumptions is correct. They are inconsistent with fundamental principles of combinatorics of bounded encoded networks. It is shown there are inherent complexity and control capacity limits for any gene regulatory network that is based solely on protein coding genes such as transcription factors. This result has significant practical consequences for understanding development, evolution, the Cambrian Explosion, as well as multi-cellular diseases such as cancer. If the arguments are sound, then genes cannot explain the development of complex multicellular organisms and genes cannot explain the evolution of complex multicellular life.",0
"We show that the competition between interactions on different length scales, as relevant for the formation of stripes in doped Mott insulators, can cause a glass transition in a system with no explicitly quenched disorder. We analytically determine a universal criterion for the emergence of an exponentially large number of metastable configurations that leads to a finite configurational entropy and a landscape dominated viscous flow. We demonstrate that glassines is unambiguously tied to a new length scale which characterizes the typical length over which defects and imperfections in the stripe pattern are allowed to wander over long times.",0
"We consider the problem of online audio source separation. Existing algorithms adopt either a sliding block approach or a stochastic gradient approach, which is faster but less accurate. Also, they rely either on spatial cues or on spectral cues and cannot separate certain mixtures. In this paper, we design a general online audio source separation framework that combines both approaches and both types of cues. The model parameters are estimated in the Maximum Likelihood (ML) sense using a Generalised Expectation Maximisation (GEM) algorithm with multiplicative updates. The separation performance is evaluated as a function of the block size and the step size and compared to that of an offline algorithm.",0
"The cometary materials are thought to be the reservoir of primitive materials in the solar system. The recent detection of glycine and CH$_3$NH$_2$ by the ROSINA mass spectrometer in the coma of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko suggests that amino acids and their precursors have been formed in such an early evolutionary phase of the Solar System. We use our chemical modeling for low-mass star-forming regions to investigate if we can explain observed """"Glycine/CH$_3$NH$_2$"""" ratio. As a result, the predicted molecular ratio of """"CH$_3$NH$_2$/Glycine"""" during star-formation is less than 10$^{-2}$, while the ROSINA measurement has shown this value to be unity. With the hypothesis that glycine is condensed in the cometary surface during the numerous passages of perihelion after the formation of the Solar System, we develop the numerical model to discuss this condensation process. Our modeling results suggest that glycine is highly likely condensed in the cometary surface due to its high binding energy, and """"Glycine/CH$_3$NH$_2$"""" ratio will be highly enhanced if the outbursts eject the materials condensed on cometary surface.",0
"Studies of the physical measures for Cherry flows were initiated by R. Saghin and E. Vargas in """"Invariant measures for Cherry flows"""". While the non-positive divergence case was resolved, the positive divergence one still lacked the complete description. Some conjectures were put forward. In this paper we contribute in this direction. Namely, under mild technical assumptions we solve conjectures stated by R. Saghin and E. Vargas by providing a description of the physical measures for Cherry flows in the positive divergence case.",0
"Recent years saw a fast development of quantum algorithms that solve combinatorial optimization problems, such as graph coloring, by finding the ground state of a suitable quantum system. Inspired by this, we show how to couple phase-oscillators on a graph so that collective dynamics `searches' for the coloring of that graph as it relaxes towards the dynamical equilibrium. This translates a combinatorial optimization problem (graph coloring) into a continuous optimization problem (finding and evaluating the global minimum of dynamical non-equilibrium potential, done by the natural system's evolution). Using a sample of graphs we show that our method performs at least as good as traditional combinatorial algorithms and can serve as a viable alternative to them. Moreover, we show that with the same computational cost our method efficiently solves the harder problem of improper coloring of weighed graphs.",0
"We estimate the number of integer solutions to decomposable form inequalities (both asymptotic estimates and upper bounds are provided) when the degree of the form and the number of variables are relatively prime. These estimates display good behavior in terms of the coefficients of the form, and greatly improve upon previous estimates in this regard.",0
"Private information retrieval (PIR) is the problem of retrieving as efficiently as possible, one out of $K$ messages from $N$ non-communicating replicated databases (each holds all $K$ messages) while keeping the identity of the desired message index a secret from each individual database. The information theoretic capacity of PIR (equivalently, the reciprocal of minimum download cost) is the maximum number of bits of desired information that can be privately retrieved per bit of downloaded information. $T$-private PIR is a generalization of PIR to include the requirement that even if any $T$ of the $N$ databases collude, the identity of the retrieved message remains completely unknown to them. Robust PIR is another generalization that refers to the scenario where we have $M \geq N$ databases, out of which any $M - N$ may fail to respond. For $K$ messages and $M\geq N$ databases out of which at least some $N$ must respond, we show that the capacity of $T$-private and Robust PIR is $\left(1+T/N+T^2/N^2+\cdots+T^{K-1}/N^{K-1}\right)^{-1}$. The result includes as special cases the capacity of PIR without robustness ($M=N$) or $T$-privacy constraints ($T=1$).",0
"Let $R$ be a commutative ring and $\mathcal A$ an $R$-algebra. An $R$-$\mathcal E$-derivation of $\mathcal A$ is an $R$-linear map of the form $\operatorname{I}-\phi$ for some $R$-algebra endomorphism $\phi$ of $\mathcal A$, where $\operatorname{I}$ denotes the identity map of $\mathcal A$. In this paper we discuss some open problems on whether or not the image of a locally finite $R$-derivation or $R$-$\mathcal E$-derivation of $\mathcal A$ is a Mathieu subspace [Z2, Z3] of $\mathcal A$, and whether or not a locally nilpotent $R$-derivation or $R$-$\mathcal E$-derivation of $\mathcal A$ maps every ideal of $\mathcal A$ to a Mathieu subspace of $\mathcal A$. We propose and discuss two conjectures which state that both questions above have positive answers if the base ring $R$ is a field of characteristic zero. We give some examples to show the necessity of the conditions of the two conjectures, and discuss some positive cases known in the literature. We also show some cases of the two conjectures. In particular, both the conjectures are proved for locally finite or locally nilpotent algebraic derivations and $\mathcal E$-derivations of integral domains of characteristic zero.",0
"In this paper,we obtain two results on closed Reimainnian manifold $M\times [0,T]$.When $T$ is small enough,to any prescribed scalar curvature, the existence and uniqueness of metrics are obtained on the volume element preserving deformation.When $T$ is large and the given scalar curvature is small enough,the same result holds.",0
"In the field of numerical approximation, specialists considering highly complex problems have recently proposed various ways to simplify their underlying problems. In this field, depending on the problem they were tackling and the community that are at work, different approaches have been developed with some success and have even gained some maturity, the applications can now be applied to information analysis or for numerical simulation of PDE's. At this point, a crossed analysis and effort for understanding the similarities and the differences between these approaches that found their starting points in different backgrounds is of interest. It is the purpose of this paper to contribute to this effort by comparing some constructive reduced representations of complex functions. We present here in full details the Adaptive Cross Approximation (ACA) and the Empirical Interpolation Method (EIM) together with other approaches that enter in the same category.",0
"We propose new supergravity models describing chaotic Linde- and Starobinsky-like inflation in terms of a single chiral superfield. The key ideas to obtain a positive vacuum energy during large field inflation are (i) stabilization of the real or imaginary partner of the inflaton by modifying a Kahler potential, and (ii) use of the crossing terms in the scalar potential originating from a polynomial superpotential. Our inflationary models are constructed by starting from the minimal Kahler potential with a shift symmetry, and are extended to the no-scale case. Our methods can be applied to more general inflationary models in supergravity with only one chiral superfield.",0
"We analyse the complexity of environments according to the policies that need to be used to achieve high performance. The performance results for a population of policies leads to a distribution that is examined in terms of policy complexity and analysed through several diagrams and indicators. The notion of environment response curve is also introduced, by inverting the performance results into an ability scale. We apply all these concepts, diagrams and indicators to a minimalistic environment class, agent-populated elementary cellular automata, showing how the difficulty, discriminating power and ranges (previous to normalisation) may vary for several environments.",0
"The Kondo lattice model with Hund's ferromagnetic spin coupling is investigated as a microscopic model of the perovskite-type $3d$ manganese oxide (R,A)MnO$_3$ where $R$ and $A$ are rare earth element and alkaline earth element, respectively. We take the classical spin limit $S=\infty$ for the simplicity of the calculation, since the quantum exchange process seems to be irrelevant in the high temperature paramagnetic phase. Magnetic and transport properties of the system are calculated. In the hole doped systems, ferromagnetic instabilities are observed as the temperature is lowered. The giant magnetoresistance of this model is in excellent agreement with the experimental data of (La,Sr)MnO$_3$.",0
"We present multi-frequency multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations of J11584+2450. These observations clearly show this source, previously classified as a core-jet, to be a compact symmetric object (CSO). Comparisons between these new data and data taken over the last 9 years shows the edge brightened hot spots retreating towards the core (and slightly to the west) at approximately 0.3c. Whether this motion is strictly apparent or actually physical in nature is discussed, as well as possible explanations, and what implications a physical contraction of J11584+2450 would have for current CSO models.",0
"We propose and numerically analyze the hybrid Si-Ge\textsubscript{2}Sb\textsubscript{2}Te\textsubscript{5} strip waveguide switches for Mid-IR wavelength of 2.1 $\mu$m. The switches investigated are one input-one output (on-off) type and one input-two outputs (directional coupler) type. The reversible transition between the switch states is achieved by inducing the phase transition from crystalline to amorphous and vice-versa by application of voltage pulses. The approach of embedding the nanoscale active material Ge\textsubscript{2}Sb\textsubscript{2}Te\textsubscript{5} within the Si waveguide is taken to enhance the interaction of light with the active region of the switches. The dimensions of the active regions of the switches are optimized to achieve low insertion loss, low switching energy, and high extinction ratio. In case of one input-one output switch, an extinction ratio of 33.79 dB along with an extremely low insertion loss of 0.52 dB is achieved using optimum Ge\textsubscript{2}Sb\textsubscript{2}Te\textsubscript{5} length of only 0.92 $\mu$m. For one input-two outputs switch, an extinction ratio of 10.33 dB and 5.23 dB is obtained in cross and bar state respectively using an active length of 52 $\mu$m. These values of extinction ratio, which are otherwise 18.59 dB and 8.33 dB respectively, are due to the necessity of doping the Si beneath the Ge\textsubscript{2}Sb\textsubscript{2}Te\textsubscript{5} to facilitate the electrical conduction needed for Joule heating. A suitable gap of 100 nm is kept between the active and passive arm of the directional coupler switch. The electro-thermal co-simulations confirm that phase change occurs in whole of the Ge\textsubscript{2}Sb\textsubscript{2}Te\textsubscript{5} region in both types of switches.",0
"There has been a steady interest in flavor anomalies and their global fits as ideal probes of new physics. If the anomalies are real, one promising explanation is a new $Z'$ gauge boson with flavor-changing coupling to bottom and strange quarks and a flavor-conserving coupling to muons and, possibly, electrons. We point out that direct production of such a $Z'$, emerging from the collision of $b$ and $s$ quarks, may offer a complementary window into these phenomena because collider searches already provide competitive constraints. On top of that, we analyse the same $Z'$ scenario in relation to another long-standing discrepancy between theory and experiment that concerns the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. By scanning the allowed $Z'$ coupling strengths in the low-mass region, we assess the compatibility of the signals from LHCb with the $Z'$ searches in the high energy LHC data and the measurements of the anomalous magnetic moment of the involved leptons. We also argue that observations of the latter can break the degeneracy pattern in the Wilson coefficients $C_9$ and $C_{10}$ presented by LHCb data. The $Z'$ model we consider is compatible with the new measurement of $R_{K^*}$, therefore it can potentially account for the long-standing deviations observed in $B$-physics.",0
"Understanding the robustness of topological phases of matter in the presence of strong interactions, and synthesising novel strongly-correlated topological materials, lie among the most important and difficult challenges of modern theoretical and experimental physics. In this work, we present a complete theoretical analysis of the synthetic Creutz-Hubbard ladder, which is a paradigmatic model that provides a neat playground to address these challenges. We put special attention to the competition of correlated topological phases and orbital quantum magnetism in the regime of strong interactions. These results are furthermore confirmed and extended by extensive numerical simulations. Moreover we propose how to experimentally realize this model in a synthetic ladder, made of two internal states of ultracold fermionic atoms in a one-dimensional optical lattice. Our work paves the way towards quantum simulators of interacting topological insulators with cold atoms.",0
"Proposing smooth initial conditions is one of the most important tasks in quantum cosmology. On the other hand, the low-energy effective action, appearing in the semiclassical path integral, can get nontrivial quantum corrections near classical singularities due to specific quantum gravity proposals. In this article, we combine the well-known no-boundary proposal for the wavefunction of the universe with quantum modifications coming from loop quantum cosmology (LQC). Remarkably, we find that the restriction of a `slow-roll' type potential in the original Hartle-Hawking proposal is considerably relaxed due to quantum geometry regularizations. Interestingly, the same effects responsible for singularity-resolution in LQC also end up expanding the allowed space of smooth initial conditions leading to an inflationary universe.",0
"We consider theoretically two coupled optical waveguides with a varying barrier height along the waveguides direction. The barrier could be constructed by the elongated island with a reduced refractive index (which acts as a potential barrier), such that in the middle region it splits a waveguide into two weakly coupled parts. It is predicted by numerical simulations and analytical consideration that the presence of some imperfection of the system parameters can cause splitting of injected laser beam and one will observe two intensity maximums at the output, while for small imperfections the input and output beam intensity distributions will be the same. The switching between two regimes could be achieved changing spectral width of the beam or refractive index of the island. This nontrivial effect is explained by possibility of transitions between the different eigenstates of the system in the region of large potential barrier heights. The mentioned effect could be used for all-optical readdressing and filtering purposes.",0
"The relation between super-Virasoro anomaly and super-Weyl anomaly in $N=1$ NSR superstring coupled with 2D supergravity is investigated from canonical theoretical view point. The WZW action canceling the super-Virasoro anomaly is explicitly constructed. It is super-Weyl invariant but nonlocal functional of 2D supergravity. The nonlocality can be remedied by the super-Liouvlle action, which in turn recovers the super-Weyl anomaly. The final gravitational effective action turns out to be local but noncovariant super-Liouville action, describing the dynamical behavior of the super-Liouville fields. The BRST invariance of this approach is examined in the superconformal gauge and in the light-cone gauge.",0
A nonperturbative renormalization group equation describes how the momentum dependent four-quark vertex depends on an infrared cutoff. We find a quasilocal one-particle irreducible piece generated by (anomaly-free) multi-gluon exchange. It becomes important at a cutoff scale where scalar and pseudoscalar meson-bound states are expected to play a role. This interaction remains subleading as compared to the effective one-gluon exchange contribution. The local instanton induced four-quark interaction becomes dominant at a scale around 800 MeV. In absence of a gluon mass the strong dependence of the one-gluon exchange on the transferred momentum indicates that the pointlike interactions of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model cannot give a very accurate description of QCD. A pointlike effective four-quark interaction becomes more realistic in case of spontaneous color symmetry breaking.,0
"Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases are short-range entangled quantum phases with symmetry, which have gapped excitations in the bulk and gapless modes at the edge. In this paper, we study the SPT phases in the spin-1 Heisenberg chain with a single-ion anisotropy D, which has a quantum phase transition between a Haldane phase and a large-D phase. Using symmetric multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) tensor networks, we study the nonlocal order parameters for time-reversal and inversion symmetry. For the inversion symmetric MERA, we propose a brick-and-rope representation that gives a geometrical interpretation of inversion symmetric tensors. Finally, we study the symmetric renormalization group (RG) flow of the inversion symmetric string-order parameter, and show that entanglement renormalization with symmetric tensors produces proper behavior of the RG fixed-points.",0
"A new framework based on Boltzmann equation which is genuinely multidimensional and mesh-less is developed for solving Euler's equations. The idea is to use the method of moment of Boltzmann equation to operate in multidimensions using polar coordinates. The aim is to develop a framework which is genuinely multidimensional and can be implemented with different methodologies, no matter whether it is in finite difference, finite volume or finite element form. There is a considerable improvement in capturing shocks and other discontinuities. Also, since the method is multidimensional, the flow features are captured isotropically. The method is further extended to second order using 'Arc of Approach' concept. The framework is developed as a finite difference method (called as GINEUS) and is tested on the benchmark test cases. The results are compared against Kinetic Flux Vector Splitting Method.",0
"The quantum phase transition in iron-based superconductors with 'half-Dirac' node at the electron Fermi surface as a $T=0$ structural phase transition described in terms of nematic order is discussed. An effective low energy theory that describes half-Dirac nodal Fermions and their coupling to Ising nematic order that describes the phase transition is derived and analyzed using renormalization group (RG) study of the large-$N_f$ version of the theory. The inherent absence of Lorentz invariance of the theory leads to RG flow structure where the velocities $v_F$ and $v_\Delta$ at the paired half-Dirac nodes ($1\overline{1}$ and $2\overline{2}$) in general flow differently under RG, implying that the nodal electron gap is deformed and the $C_4$ symmetry is broken, explaining the structural (orthogonal to orthorhombic) phase transition at the quantum critical point (QCP). The theory is found to have Gaussian fixed point $\lambda^*=0, (v_{\Delta}/v_F)^*=0$ with stable flow lines toward it, suggesting a second order nematic phase transition. Interpreting the fermion-Ising nematic boson interaction as a decay process of nematic Ising order parameter scalar field fluctuations into half-Dirac nodal fermions, I find that the theory surprisingly behaves as systems with dynamical critical exponent $z = 1$, reflecting undamped quantum critical dynamics and emergent fully relativistic field theory arising from the non(fully)-relativistic field theory and is direct consequence of $(v_{\Delta}/v_F)^*=0$ fixed point. The nematic critical fluctuations lead to remarkable change to the spectral function peak where at a critical point $\lambda_c$, directly related to nematic QCP, the central spectral peak collapses and splits into satellite spectral peaks around nodal point. The vanishing of the zero modes density of states leads to the undamped $z=1$ quantum critical dynamics.",0
We study the passage from Drinfeld-A'-modules to Drinfeld-A-modules for a given finite flat inclusion A \subset A'. We show that this defines a morphism from the moduli space of Drinfeld-A'-modules to the moduli space of Drinfeld-A-modules which is proper but in general not representable. For Drinfeld-Anderson shtuka and abelian sheaves instead of Drinfeld modules we obtain the same results.,0
"We analyze thermodynamics of water samples confined in nanopores and prove that although the freezing temperature can be dramatically lower, the suppression of the ice nucleation leading to the freezing temperature depression is a truly macroscopic effect rather than a consequence of microscopic interactions. The freezing transition itself is a truly collective phenomenon described by a macroscopic order parameter (the nearly homogeneous density of the liquid within the pore away from the pores wall) exactly in the same way as in the bulk liquid. The thermodynamics properties of the confined and the bulk liquid can be described by macroscopic thermodynamics and be readily related to each other simply by proper inclusion of the additional Laplace pressure exerted by the solid-liquid boundary.",0
"Some astrophysical observations of molecular hydrogen point to a broadening of the velocity distribution for molecules at excited rotational levels. This effect is observed in both Galactic and high redshift clouds. Analysis of H_2, HD, and CI absorption lines has revealed the broadening effect in the absorption system of QSO 1232+082 (z_{abs}=2.33771). We analyze line broadening mechanisms by considering in detail the transfer of ultraviolet radiation (in the resonance lines of the Lyman and Werner H_2 molecular bands) for various velocity distributions at excited rotational levels. The mechanism we suggest includes the saturation of the lines that populate excited rotational levels (radiative pumping) and manifests itself most clearly in the case of directional radiation in the medium. Based on the calculated structure of a molecular hydrogen cloud in rotational level populations, we have considered an additional mechanism that takes into account the presence of a photodissociation region. Note that disregarding the broadening effects we investigated can lead to a significant systematic error when the data are processed.",0
"The possibility to observe new bottomonium states with $J^{PC}= 1^{--}$ in the region $10.7-11.1$ GeV is discussed. The analysis of the di-electron widths shows that the $(n+1)^3S_1$ and $n^3D_1$ states ($n\geq 3$) may be mixed with a rather large mixing angle, $\theta\sim30^\circ$ and this effect provides the correct values of $\Gamma_{ee}(\Upsilon(10580))$ and $\Gamma_{ee}(\Upsilon(11020))$. On the other hand, the $S-D$ mixing gives rise to an increase by two orders of magnitude of the di-electron widths of the mixed $\tilde\Upsilon(n^3D_1$) resonances ($n=3,4,5$), which originate from pure $D-$wave states. The value $\Gamma_{ee}(\tilde\Upsilon(3D))=0.095^{+0.028}_{-0.025}$ keV is obtained, being only $\sim 3$ times smaller than the di-electron width of $\Upsilon(10580)$, while $\Gamma_{ee}(\tilde\Upsilon(5D))\sim 135$ eV appears to be close to $\Gamma_{ee}(\Upsilon(11020))$ and therefore this resonance may become manifest in the $e^+e^-$ experiments. The mass differences between $M(nD)$ and $M((n+1)S) (n=4,5)$ are shown to be rather small, $50\pm 10$ MeV.",0
"Understanding the quantum dynamics of strongly interacting fermions is a problem relevant to diverse forms of matter, including high-temperature superconductors, neutron stars, and quark-gluon plasma. An appealing benchmark is offered by cold atomic gases in the unitary limit of strong interactions. Here we study the dynamics of a transversely magnetized unitary Fermi gas in an inhomogeneous magnetic field. We observe the demagnetization of the gas, caused by diffusive spin transport. At low temperatures, the diffusion constant saturates to the conjectured quantum-mechanical lower bound $\simeq \hbar/m$, where $m$ is the particle mass. The development of pair correlations, indicating the transformation of the initially non-interacting gas towards a unitary spin mixture, is observed by measuring Tan's contact parameter.",0
"In the context of the recent interest in solvable models of scattering mediated by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians (cf. H. F. Jones, Phys. Rev. D 76, 125003 (2007)) we show that and how the well known variability of our ad hoc choice of the metric $\Theta$ which defines the physical Hilbert space of states can help us to clarify several apparent paradoxes. We argue that with a suitable $\Theta$ a fully plausible physical picture of the scattering is recovered. Quantitatively, our new recipe is illustrated on an exactly solvable toy model.",0
"The Lanczos potential $L_{abc}$ acts as a tensor potential for the spin-2 field strength $W_{abcd}$ in an role similar to that of the vector potential $A_a$ for the Maxwell tensor $F_{ab}$. After some general considerations inspired by the example of electromagnetism, we consider the linear spin-2 theory and a Born-Infeld type action in terms of $L_{abc}$.",0
"In a paper by Michaelis a class of infinite-dimensional Lie bialgebras containing the Virasoro algebra was presented. This type of Lie bialgebras was classified by Ng and Taft. In this paper, all Lie bialgebra structures on the Lie algebras of generalized Witt type are classified. It is proved that, for any Lie algebra $W$ of generalized Witt type, all Lie bialgebras on $W$ are coboundary triangular Lie bialgebras. As a by-product, it is also proved that the first cohomology group $H^1(W,W \otimes W)$ is trivial.",0
"In addition to superconformal symmetry, (1,1) supersymmetric two-dimensional sigma models on special holonomy manifolds have extra symmetries that are in one-to-one correspondence with the covariantly constant forms on these manifolds. The superconformal algebras extended by these symmetries close as W-algebras, i.e. they have field-dependent structure functions. It is shown that it is not possible to write down cohomological equations for potential quantum anomalies when the structure functions are field-dependent. In order to do this it is necessary to linearise the algebras by treating composite currents as generators of additional symmetries. It is shown that all cases can be linearised in a finite number of steps, except for G_2 and SU(3). Additional problems in the quantisation procedure are briefly discussed.",0
"Classification is one of the core problems in Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD), targeting for early cancer detection using 3D medical imaging interpretation. High detection sensitivity with desirably low false positive (FP) rate is critical for a CAD system to be accepted as a valuable or even indispensable tool in radiologists' workflow. Given various spurious imagery noises which cause observation uncertainties, this remains a very challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel, two-tiered coarse-to-fine (CTF) classification cascade framework to tackle this problem. We first obtain classification-critical data samples (e.g., samples on the decision boundary) extracted from the holistic data distributions using a robust parametric model (e.g., \cite{Raykar08}); then we build a graph-embedding based nonparametric classifier on sampled data, which can more accurately preserve or formulate the complex classification boundary. These two steps can also be considered as effective """"sample pruning"""" and """"feature pursuing + $k$NN/template matching"""", respectively. Our approach is validated comprehensively in colorectal polyp detection and lung nodule detection CAD systems, as the top two deadly cancers, using hospital scale, multi-site clinical datasets. The results show that our method achieves overall better classification/detection performance than existing state-of-the-art algorithms using single-layer classifiers, such as the support vector machine variants \cite{Wang08}, boosting \cite{Slabaugh10}, logistic regression \cite{Ravesteijn10}, relevance vector machine \cite{Raykar08}, $k$-nearest neighbor \cite{Murphy09} or spectral projections on graph \cite{Cai08}.",0
"Facial emotion expression for virtual characters is used in a wide variety of areas. Often, the primary reason to use emotion expression is not to study emotion expression generation per se, but to use emotion expression in an application or research project. What is then needed is an easy to use and flexible, but also validated mechanism to do so. In this report we present such a mechanism. It enables developers to build virtual characters with dynamic affective facial expressions. The mechanism is based on Facial Action Coding. It is easy to implement, and code is available for download. To show the validity of the expressions generated with the mechanism we tested the recognition accuracy for 6 basic emotions (joy, anger, sadness, surprise, disgust, fear) and 4 blend emotions (enthusiastic, furious, frustrated, and evil). Additionally we investigated the effect of VC distance (z-coordinate), the effect of the VC's face morphology (male vs. female), the effect of a lateral versus a frontal presentation of the expression, and the effect of intensity of the expression. Participants (n=19, Western and Asian subjects) rated the intensity of each expression for each condition (within subject setup) in a non forced choice manner. All of the basic emotions were uniquely perceived as such. Further, the blends and confusion details of basic emotions are compatible with findings in psychology.",0
"We study the temperature-dependent quantum correction to conductivity due to the interplay of spin density fluctuations and weak disorder for a two-dimensional metal near an antiferromagnetic (AFM) quantum critical point. AFM spin density fluctuations carry large momenta around the ordering vector $\mathbf{Q}$ and, at lowest order of the spin-fermion coupling, only scatter electrons between """"hot spots"""" of the Fermi surface which are connected by $\mathbf{Q}$. Earlier, it was seen that the quantum interference between AFM spin density fluctuations and soft diffusive modes of the disordered metal is suppressed, a consequence of the large-momentum scattering. The suppression of this interference results in a non-singular temperature dependence of the corresponding interaction correction to conductivity. However, at higher order of the spin-fermion coupling, electrons on the entire Fermi surface can be scattered successively by two spin density fluctuations and, in total, suffer a small momentum transfer. This higher-order process can be described by composite modes which carry small momenta. We show that the interference between formally subleading composite modes and diffusive modes generates singular interaction corrections which ultimately dominate over the non-singular first-order correction at low temperatures. We derive an effective low-energy theory from the spin-fermion model which includes the above-mentioned higher-order process implicitly and show that for weak spin-fermion coupling the small-momentum transfer is mediated by a composite propagator. Employing the conventional diagrammatic approach to impurity scattering, we find the correction $\delta \sigma \sim +\ln^2 T$ for temperatures above an exponentially small crossover scale.",0
"Although classical economic theory is based on the concept of stable equilibrium, real economic systems appear to be always out of equilibrium. Indeed, they share many of the dynamical features of other complex systems, e.g., ecological food-webs. We focus on the relation between increasing complexity of the economic network and its stability with respect to small perturbations in the dynamical variables associated with the constituent nodes. Inherent delays and multiple time-scales suggest that economic systems will be more likely to exhibit instabilities as their complexity is increased even though the speed at which transactions are conducted has increased many-fold through technological developments. Analogous to the birth of nonlinear dynamics from Poincare's work on the question of whether the solar system is stable, we suggest that similar theoretical developments may arise from efforts by econophysicists to understand the mechanisms by which instabilities arise in the economy.",0
"For higher derivative theories of gravity, it is possible to write the action in terms of auxiliary fields. In such case, one can show that the equations of motion for both actions are equivalent and hence the actions themselves. In this paper we show that one can obtain the Wald's entropy from the equivalent action. We use this useful approach to localise a non-local gravitational action and calculate its associated entropy.",0
"It is now commonly accepted that the unit disk graph used to model the physical layer in wireless networks does not reflect real radio transmissions, and that the lognormal shadowing model better suits to experimental simulations. Previous work on realistic scenarios focused on unicast, while broadcast requirements are fundamentally different and cannot be derived from unicast case. Therefore, broadcast protocols must be adapted in order to still be efficient under realistic assumptions. In this paper, we study the well-known multipoint relay protocol (MPR). In the latter, each node has to choose a set of neighbors to act as relays in order to cover the whole 2-hop neighborhood. We give experimental results showing that the original method provided to select the set of relays does not give good results with the realistic model. We also provide three new heuristics in replacement and their performances which demonstrate that they better suit to the considered model. The first one maximizes the probability of correct reception between the node and the considered relays multiplied by their coverage in the 2-hop neighborhood. The second one replaces the coverage by the average of the probabilities of correct reception between the considered neighbor and the 2-hop neighbors it covers. Finally, the third heuristic keeps the same concept as the second one, but tries to maximize the coverage level of the 2-hop neighborhood: 2-hop neighbors are still being considered as uncovered while their coverage level is not higher than a given coverage threshold, many neighbors may thus be selected to cover the same 2-hop neighbors.",0
"We investigate the glueball spectrum of a strongly coupled gauge theory with two dynamical scales. The main tool is the use of the gauge/gravity duality. The model we study has a known graviational dual, which arises from a type IIB D-brane configuration. It exhibits two dynamical scales, separated by a nearly conformal region. Thus, it is of great interest for the study of walking in gauge theories. By using the gravitational description, we are able to compute analytically the glueball mass spectrum in a certain range of the parameter space of the theory. Within that range, we do not find a light state that could be associated with a slight breaking of conformal invariance. Finally, we show that in this model there can be an order of magnitude hierarchy between the scale of confinement, given by the lowest glueball mass, and the scale of chiral symmetry breaking, determined by the lowest vector-meson mass.",0
"We have used the Westerbork array to carry out an unbiased wide-field survey for HI emission features, achieving an RMS sensitivity of about 18 mJy/Beam at a velocity resolution of 17 km/s over 1800 deg^2 and between -1000 < V_Hel<+6500 km/s. The primary data consists of auto-correlation spectra with an effective angular resolution of 49' FWHM. We detect 155 external galaxies in excess of 8 sigma in integrated HI flux density. Plausible optical associations are found within a 30' search radius for all but one of our HI detections in DSS images, although several are not previously cataloged or do not have published red-shift determinations. Twenty-three of our objects are detected in HI for the first time. We classify almost half of our detections as ``confused'', since one or more companions is cataloged within a radius of 30' and a velocity interval of 400 km/s. We identify a handful of instances of significant positional offsets exceeding 10 kpc of unconfused optical galaxies with the associated HI centroid, possibly indicative of severe tidal distortions or uncataloged gas-rich companions. A possible trend is found for an excess of detected HI flux in unconfused galaxies within our large survey beam relative to that detected previously in smaller telescope beams, both as function of increasing distance and increasing gas mass. This may be an indication for a diffuse gaseous component on 100 kpc scales in the environment of massive galaxies or a population of uncataloged low mass companions. We use our galaxy sample to estimate the HI mass function from our survey volume. Good agreement is found with the HIPASS BGC results, but only after explicit correction for galaxy density variations with distance.",0
"I argue that the geometric phase, responsible for reversible pump currents in classical stochastic kinetics, can be observed experimentally with an electronic setup, similar to the ones reported recently in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 96,076605 (2006)] and [Nature Physics 3, 243 - 247 (2007)].",0
"We analyse the nucleation of quark matter droplets under protoneutron star conditions. We adopt a two-phase framework in which the hadronic phase is described through a non-linear Walecka model and the just deconfined matter by the MIT bag model including color superconductivity. Surface tension and curvature energy are calculated self-consistently within the MRE formalism. We impose flavour conservation during the transition, which means that the just deconfined quark droplet is transiently out of equilibrium with respect to weak interactions. Our results show that trapped neutrinos slightly increase the critical density for deconfinement and that color superconductivity significantly decreases such density at low temperatures. We also show that the nucleation rate is negligible for droplets larger than 100-200 fm and is huge for smaller droplets provided that the temperature is low enough. We compare our results with previous calculations using the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with color superconductivity and the MIT bag model without color superconductivity. We conclude that the deconfinement transition should be triggered instantaneously when a density slightly larger than the bulk transition density is reached at some layer of a protoneutron star. Since color superconductivity lowers the transition density at low temperatures, the transition is likely to occur after significant cooling in a massive enough protoneutron star.",0
"We introduce the completeness problem for Modal Logic and examine its complexity. For a definition of completeness for formulas, given a formula of a modal logic, the completeness problem asks whether the formula is complete for that logic. We discover that completeness and validity have the same complexity --- with certain exceptions for which there are, in general, no complete formulas. To prove upper bounds, we present a non-deterministic polynomial-time procedure with an oracle from PSPACE that combines tableaux and a test for bisimulation, and determines whether a formula is complete.",0
The retardation and temperature effects in two-body collisions are studied. The collision integral with retardation effects is obtained on the base of the Kadanoff- Baym equations for Green functions in a form with allowance for reaching the local equilibrium system. The collisional relaxation times of collective vibrations are calculated using both the transport approach and doorway state mechanism with hierarchy of particle-hole configurations in heated nuclei. The relaxation times of the kinetic method are rather slowly dependent on multipolarity of the Fermi surface distortion and mode of the collective motion. The dependence of the relaxation times on temperature as well as on frequency of collective vibrations is considered and compared. It is shown that variations of the in-medium two-body cross-sections with energy lead to non-quadratic dependence of the collisional relaxation time both on temperature and on collective motion frequency.,0
"In this paper we study the tachyonic inflation in brane world cosmology with Gauss-Bonnet term in the bulk. We obtain the exact solution of slow roll equations in case of exponential potential. We attempt to implement the proposal of Lidsey and Nunes, astro-ph/0303168, for the tachyon condensate rolling on the Gauss-Bonnet brane and discuss the difficulties associated with the proposal.",0

"Discrete combinatorial optimization has a central role in many scientific disciplines, however, for hard problems we lack linear time algorithms that would allow us to solve very large instances. Moreover, it is still unclear what are the key features that make a discrete combinatorial optimization problem hard to solve. Here we study random K-satisfiability problems with $K=3,4$, which are known to be very hard close to the SAT-UNSAT threshold, where problems stop having solutions. We show that the backtracking survey propagation algorithm, in a time practically linear in the problem size, is able to find solutions very close to the threshold, in a region unreachable by any other algorithm. All solutions found have no frozen variables, thus supporting the conjecture that only unfrozen solutions can be found in linear time, and that a problem becomes impossible to solve in linear time when all solutions contain frozen variables.",0
"The need to increase data transfer rates constitutes a key challenge in modern information-driven societies. Taking advantage of the transverse spatial modes of light to encode more information is a promising avenue for both classical and quantum photonics. However, to ease access to the encoded information, it is essential to be able to sort spatial modes into different output channels. Here, we introduce a novel way to customize the sorting of arbitrary spatial light modes. Our method relies on the high degree of control over random scattering processes by preshaping of the phase structure of the incident light. We demonstrate experimentally that various sets of modes, irrespective of their specific modal structure, can be transformed to any output channel arrangement. Thus, our method enables full access to all of the information encoded in the transverse structure of the field, for example, azimuthal and radial modes. We also demonstrate that coherence is retained in this complex mode transformation, which opens up applications in quantum and classical information science.",0
"In the era of precision cosmology the Virgo cluster takes on a new role in the cosmic distance scale. Its traditional role of testing the consistency of secondary distance indicators is replaced by an ensemble of distance measurements within the Local Supercluster united by a velocity field model obtained from redshift survey based reconstruction. WMAP leads us to see the Hubble Constant as one of six parameters in a standard model of cosmology with considerable covariance between parameters. Independent experiments, such as WMAP and the HST Key Project (and their successors) constrain these parameters.",0
"We introduce and study an extended """"t-U-J"""" two-orbital model for the pnictides that includes Heisenberg terms deduced from the strong coupling expansion. Including these J terms explicitly allows us to enhance the strength of the (pi, 0)-(0, pi) spin order which favors the presence of tightly bound pairing states even in the small clusters that are here exactly diagonalized. The A1g and B2g pairing symmetries are found to compete in the realistic spin-ordered and metallic regime. The dynamical pairing susceptibility additionally unveils low-lying B1g states, suggesting that small changes in parameters may render any of the three channels stable.",0
"We completely describe the tree classes of the components of the stable Auslander-Reiten quiver of a quantum complete intersection. In particular, we show that the tree class is always $A_{\infty}$ whenever the algebra is of wild representation type. Moreover, in the tame case, there is one component of tree class $\tilde{A}_{12}$, whereas all the other are of tree class $A_{\infty}$.",0
"We implemented a coarse-graining procedure to construct mesoscopic models of complex molecules. The final aim is to obtain better results on properties depending on slow modes of the molecules. Therefore the number of particles considered in molecular dynamics simulations is reduced while conserving as many properties of the original substance as possible. We address the problem of finding nonbonded interaction parameters which reproduce structural properties from experiment or atomistic simulations. The approach consists of optimizing automatically nonbonded parameters using the simplex algorithm to fit structural properties like the radial distribution function as target functions. Moreover, any mix of structural and thermodynamic properties can be included in the target function. Different spherically symmetric inter-particle potentials are discussed. Besides demonstrating the method for Lennard--Jones liquids, it is applied to several more complex molecular liquids such as diphenyl carbonate, tetrahydrofurane, and monomers of poly(isoprene).",0
"The search for habitable exoplanets and life beyond the Solar System is one of the most compelling scientific opportunities of our time. Nevertheless, the high cost of building facilities that can address this topic and the keen public interest in the results of such research requires the rigorous development of experiments that can deliver a definitive advance in our understanding. Most work to date in this area has focused on a """"systems science"""" approach of obtaining and interpreting comprehensive data for individual planets to make statements about their habitability and the possibility that they harbor life. This strategy is challenging because of the diversity of exoplanets, both observed and expected, and the limited information that can be obtained with astronomical instruments. Here we propose a complementary approach that is based on performing surveys of key planetary characteristics and using statistical marginalization to answer broader questions than can be addressed with a small sample of objects. The fundamental principle of this comparative planetology approach is maximizing what can be learned from each type of measurement by applying it widely rather than requiring that multiple kinds of observations be brought to bear on a single object. As a proof of concept, we outline a survey of terrestrial exoplanet atmospheric water and carbon dioxide abundances that would test the habitable zone hypothesis and lead to a deeper understanding of the frequency of habitable planets. We also discuss ideas for additional surveys that could be developed to test other foundational hypotheses is this area.",0
"The production of charm and beauty quarks in ep collisions at HERA has been studied by the H1 and ZEUS collaborations. Charm production is generally well described in total rate and in shape by next to leading order (NLO) calculations in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD), although in specific phase space corners the NLO calculations underestimate the observed cross sections. More and more beauty production data are becoming available. For this process, NLO QCD predictions tend to be lower than the measurements.",0
"These are notes from a 2010 talk. They concern possible ways in which Fukaya categories might be considered as """"local"""", which means glued together from simpler pieces in a loosely sheaf-theoretic sense. As the title suggests, this is purely speculative. Much of the motivation comes from tropical geometry and mirror symmetry.",0
"For the XXZ subclass of symmetric two-qubit X states, we study the behavior of quantum conditional entropy S_{cond} as a function of measurement angle \theta\in[0,\pi/2]. Numerical calculations show that the function S_{cond}(\theta) for X states can have at most one local extremum in the open interval from zero to \pi/2 (unimodality property). If the extremum is a minimum the quantum discord displays region with variable (state-dependent) optimal measurement angle \theta^*. Such \theta-regions (phases, fractions) are very tiny in the space of X state parameters. We also discover the cases when the conditional entropy has a local maximum inside the interval (0,\pi/2). It is remarkable that the maxima exist in surprisingly wide regions and the boundaries for such regions are defined by the same bifurcation conditions as for those with a minimum. Moreover, the found maxima can exceed the conditional entropy values at the ends of interval [0,\pi/2] more than by 1%. This instils hope in the possibility to detect such maxima in experiment.",0
"In this paper we will consider new bounds on the smallest primitive root modulo a prime. We will make more judicious use of the P\`olya--Vinogradov and Burgess inequalities, and use them to prove that the smallest primitive root is smaller than $p^{0.68}$ for all primes $p$.",0
"We investigate the Zeeman field effects on the bulk superfluid properties and the collective modes in two-dimensional (2D) attractive atomic Fermi gases with Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling. In the presence of a large spin-orbit coupling, the system undergoes a quantum phase transition to a topological superfluid state at a critical Zeeman field. We show that the nonanalyticities of the thermodynamic functions as well as other physical quantities at the quantum phase transition originate from the infrared singularities caused by the gapless fermionic spectrum. The same argument applies also to the BCS-BEC evolution in 2D fermionic superfluids with $p$- or d-wave pairing. The superfluid density $n_s$ and the velocity of the Goldstone sound mode $c_s$ behave oppositely in the normal and the topological superfluid phases: they are suppressed by the Zeeman field in the normal superfluid phase, but get enhanced in the topological superfluid phase. The velocity of the Goldstone sound mode also shows nonanalyticity at the quantum phase transition. For large Zeeman field, we find $n_s\rightarrow n$ and $c_s\rightarrow \upsilon_{\rm F}$, where $n$ is the total fermion density and $\upsilon_{\rm F}$ is the Fermi velocity of noninteracting system. The unusual behavior of the superfluid density and the collective modes can be understood by the fact that the spin-orbit-coupled superfluid state at large Zeeman field can be mapped to the $p_x+ip_y$ superfluid state of spinless fermions.",0
"We present a systematic study of the electronic and magnetic properties of transition-metal (TM) atomic chains adsorbed on the zigzag single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). We considered the adsorption on the external and internal wall of SWNT and examined the effect of the TM coverage and geometry on the binding energy and the spin polarization at the Fermi level. All those adsorbed chains studied have ferromagnetic ground state, but only their specific types and geometries demonstrated high spin polarization near the Fermi level. Their magnetic moment and binding energy in the ground state display interesting variation with the number of $d-$electrons of the TM atom. We also show that specific chains of transition metal atoms adsorbed on a SWNT can lead to semiconducting properties for the minority spin-bands, but semimetallic for the majority spin-bands. Spin-polarization is maintained even when the underlying SWNT is subjected to high radial strain. Spin-dependent electronic structure becomes discretized when TM atoms are adsorbed on finite segments of SWNTs. Once coupled with non-magnetic metal electrodes, these magnetic needles or nanomagnets can perform as spin-dependent resonant tunnelling devices. The electronic and magnetic properties of these nanomagnets can be engineered depending on the type and decoration of adsorbed TM atom as well as the size and symmetry of the tube. Our study is performed by using first-principles pseudopotential plane wave method within spin-polarized Density Functional Method.",0
"The uncertainty about a possible correlation between strength and inclination of the magnetic field and the continuum intensity of the sunspot penumbral fine-structure has been removed by a detailed analysis of a spatially very high resolved spectrum: the darker, lengthy penumbral lanes host a 10% stronger and >30 deg flatter magnetic field as compared to the bright penumbral locations. This finding does not only result from the high spatial resolution but also from the choice of the Fe I 6842.7 line, which obtains its essential contribution from those deep layers near the continuum intensity level where the penumbral structure is seen. The almost perfect correlation establishes that the penumbral structure is formed by two magnetic components mainly differing by their field inclination. The discrepancy with results from other Zeeman lines, as e.g. Fe I 6302.5, indicates a different field structure above the white light penumbral layers.",0
"We use bounds of mixed character sums modulo a square-free integer $q$ of a special structure to estimate the density of integer points on the hypersurface $$ f_1(x_1) + \ldots + f_n(x_n) =a x_1^{k_1} \ldots x_n^{k_n} $$ for some polynomials $f_i \in {\mathbb Z}[X]$ and nonzero integers $a$ and $k_i$, $i=1, \ldots, n$. In the case of $$ f_1(X) = \ldots = f_n(X) = X^2\quad \text{and} \quad k_1 = \ldots = k_n =1 $$ the above hypersurface is known as the Markoff-Hurwitz hypersurface, while for $$ f_1(X) = \ldots = f_n(X) = X^n\quad \text{and} \quad k_1 = \ldots = k_n =1 $$ it is known as the Dwork hypersurface. Our results are substantially stronger than those known for general hypersurfaces.",0
We study the relation between the D8-branes wrapped on an orientable compact manifold $W$ in a massive Type IIA supergravity background and the M9-branes wrapped on a compact manifold $Z$ in a massive d=11 supergravity background from the K-theoretic point of view. By speculating on the use of the dimensional reduction to relate the two theories in different dimensions and by interpreting the D8-brane charges as elements of $K_0 (C(W))$ and the (inequivalent classes of) spaces of gauge fields on the M9-branes as the elements of $K_0(C(Z)\times_{\bar{k}^*}G}$ a connection between charges and gauge fields is argued to exist. This connection is realized as a map between the corresponding algebraic K-theory groups.,0
"Quantum-mechanical analysis shows that the metrics of a centrally symmetric uncharged gravitational field, which are exact solutions of the general relativity equations, are physically non-equivalent. The classical Schwarzschield metric and the Schwarzschild metrics in isotropic and harmonic coordinates provide for the existence of stationary bound states of Dirac particles with a real energy spectrum. The Hilbert condition g_{00}>0 is responsible for zero values of the wave functions under the """"event horizon"""" that leads to the absence of Hawking radiation. For the Eddington-Finkelstein and Painleve-Gullstrand metrics, stationary bound states of spin-half particles cannot exist because Dirac Hamiltonians are non-Hermitian. For these metrics, the condition g_{00}>0 also leads to the absence of Hawking evaporation. For the Finkelstein-Lemaitre and Kruskal metrics, Dirac Hamiltonians are explicitly time-dependent, and stationary bound states of spin-half particles cannot exist for them. The Hilbert condition for these metrics does not place any constraints on the domains of the wave functions. Hawking evaporation of black holes is possible in this case. The results can lead to revisiting some concepts of the standard cosmological model related to the evolution of the universe and interaction of collapsars with surrounding matter.",0

"Recently, superconductivity in PuCoGa5 was discovered. It has the same crystal structure as CeMIn5(M=Ir, Co, Rh). The electron correlation in PuCoGa5 is estimated to be weak compared with CeMIn5, and the filling number of electrons is considered to be far from 0.5/spin in the band which plays an important role in realizing the superconductivity. Nevertheless, the superconducting transition temperature Tc in PuCoGa5 is almost by an order of magnitude higher than that in CeMIn5. In order to explain the superconductivity with high Tc, we adopt the periodic Anderson model and calculate Tc by solving the Dyson-Gor'kov equation derived by the third order perturbation theory with respect to U. By this calculation, we indicate that the superconducting state of PuCoGa5 is a d-wave pairing state, and show that the good location of two Fermi surfaces results in the high Tc in PuCoGa5.",0
"The paper begins with a general introduction and update to Fourth Generation Nuclear Weapons (FGNW), and then addresses some particularly important military aspects on which there has been only limited public discussion so far. These aspects concern the unique military characteristics of FGNWs which make them radically different from both nuclear weapons based on previous-generation nuclear-explosives and from conventional weapons based on chemical-explosives: yields in the 1 to 100 tons range, greatly enhanced coupling to targets, possibility to drive powerful shaped-charge jets and forged fragments, enhanced prompt radiation effects, reduced collateral damage and residual radioactivity, etc.",0
"We investigate a trapped surface and naked singularity in a $D$-dimensional Vaidya spacetime with a self-similar mass function. A trapped surface is defined as a closed spacelike $(D-2)$-surface which has negative both null expansions. There is no trapped surface in the Minkowski spacetime. However, in a four-dimensional self-similar Vaidya spacetime, Bengtsson and Senovilla considered non-spherical trapped surfaces and showed that a trapped surface can penetrate into a flat region, if and only if the mass function rises fast enough [I. Bengtsson and J. M. M. Senovilla, Phys. Rev. D \textbf{79}, 024027 (2009).]. We apply this result to a $D$-dimensional spacetime motivated by the context of large extra dimensions or TeV-scale gravity. In this paper, similarly to Bengtsson and Senovilla's study, we match four types of $(D-2)$-surfaces and show that a trapped surface extended into the flat region can be constructed in the $D$-dimensional Vaidya spacetime, if the increasing rate of the mass function is greater than 0.4628. Moreover, we show that the maximum radius of the trapped surface constructed here approaches the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini radius in the large $D$ limit. Also, we show that there is no naked singularity, if the spacetime has the trapped surface constructed here.",0
"We study s-wave superconductivity in the attractive Hubbard model in an applied magnetic field and assume the extreme Pauli limit where the orbital critical field is much greater than the Zeeman critical field. We work at a coupling corresponding roughly to the peak $T_c$ in the BCS to BEC crossover window and retain the crucial amplitude and phase fluctuations. At low field, as expected, the superconductor undergoes a second order thermal transition to the normal state, and is only weakly magnetized near $T_c$. At intermediate fields the thermal transition is still second order, but the magnetization is significantly larger, characteristic of a `breached pair' state. At strong field, the thermal transition is first order and our Monte Carlo reveals the presence of a metastable Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state. At even higher fields we observe the true FFLO ground state. We present the full `field-temperature' phase diagram of this strong coupling problem, revealing $T_c$ scales an order of magnitude below the mean field estimate, compute the superconducting and magnetic order parameters, and map out the directly measurable magnetic structure factor. We compare these trends to results on the Pauli limited heavy fermion CeCoIn$_5$, and the cold atomic Fermi gas at unitarity. This paper focuses primarily on the homogeneous superconducting state, another deals with thermal effects in the FFLO regime.",0
"We classify the holonomy algebras of manifolds admitting an indecomposable torsion free $G_2^*$-structure, i.e. for which the holonomy representation does not leave invariant any proper non-degenerate subspace. We realize some of these Lie algebras as holonomy algebras of left-invariant metrics on Lie groups.",0
"We propose a heat valve based on the interplay between thermal transport and proximity-induced exchange splitting in Josephson tunnel junctions. We demonstrate that the junction heat conductance strongly depends on the relative alignment of the exchange fields induced in the superconductors. Colossal magneto-heat resistance ratios as large as 10^7% are predicted to occur under proper temperature and phase conditions, as well as suitable ferromagnet-superconductor combinations. Moreover, the quantum phase tailoring, intrinsic to the Josephson coupling, offers an additional degree of freedom for the control of the heat conductance. Our predictions for the phase-coherent and spin-dependent tuning of the thermal flux can provide a useful tool for heat management at the nanoscale.",0
"This work is a conceptual analysis of certain recent developments in the mathematical foundations of Classical and Quantum Mechanics which have allowed to formulate both theories in a common language. From the algebraic point of view, the set of observables of a physical system, be it classical or quantum, is described by a \emph{Jordan-Lie algebra}. From the geometric point of view, the space of states of any system is described by a \emph{uniform Poisson space with transition probability}. Both these structures are here perceived as formal translations of \emph{the fundamental twofold role of properties in Mechanics}: they are at the same time quantities and transformations. The question becomes then to understand the precise articulation between these two roles. The analysis will show that Quantum Mechanics can be thought as distinguishing itself from Classical Mechanics by a compatibility condition between properties-as-quantities and properties-as-transformations. Moreover, this dissertation shows the existence of a tension between a certain """"abstract way"""" of conceiving mathematical structures, used in the practice of mathematical physics, and the necessary capacity to specify particular states or observables. It then becomes important to understand how, within the formalism, one can construct a \emph{labelling scheme}. The """"Chase for Individuation"""" is the analysis of different mathematical techniques which attempt to overcome this tension. In particular, we discuss how group theory furnishes a partial solution.",0
"LOFAR (the Low Frequency Array) is the largest radio telescope in the world for observing low frequency radio emission from 10 to 240 MHz. In addition to its use as an interferometric array, LOFAR is now routinely used to detect cosmic ray induced air showers by their radio emission. The LOFAR core in the Netherlands has a higher density of antennas than any dedicated cosmic ray experiment in radio. On an area of $12 \mathrm{km}^2$ more than 2300 antennas are installed. They measure the radio emission from air showers with unprecedented precision and, therefore, give the perfect opportunity to disentangle the physical processes which cause the radio emission in air showers. In parallel to ongoing astronomical observations LOFAR is triggered by an array of particle detectors to record time-series containing cosmic-ray pulses. Cosmic rays have been measured with LOFAR since June 2011. We present the results of the first year of data.",0
"We study a class of stochastic control problems where a cost of the form \begin{equation}\mathbb{E}\int_{[0,\infty)}e^{-\beta s}[\ell(X_s) ds+h(Y^{\circ}_s) d|Y|_s]\end{equation} is to be minimized over control processes $Y$ whose increments take values in a cone $\mathbb{Y}$ of $\mathbb{R}^p$, keeping the state process $X=x+B+GY$ in a cone $\mathbb{X}$ of $\mathbb{R}^k$, $k\le p$. Here, $x\in\mathbb{X}$, $B$ is a Brownian motion with drift $b$ and covariance $\Sigma$, $G$ is a fixed matrix, and $Y^{\circ}$ is the Radon--Nikodym derivative $dY/d|Y|$. Let $\mathcal{L}=-(1/2)trace(\Sigma D^2)-b\cdot D$ where $D$ denotes the gradient. Solutions to the corresponding dynamic programming PDE, \begin{equation}[(\mathcal{L}+\beta)f-\ell]\vee\sup_{y\in\mathbb{Y}:|Gy|=1 }[-Gy\cdot Df-h(y)]=0,\end{equation} on $\mathbb{X}^o$ are considered with a polynomial growth condition and are required to be supersolution up to the boundary (corresponding to a ``state constraint'' boundary condition on $\partial\mathbb{X}$). Under suitable conditions on the problem data, including continuity and nonnegativity of $\ell$ and $h$, and polynomial growth of $\ell$, our main result is the unique viscosity-sense solvability of the PDE by the control problem's value function in appropriate classes of functions. In some cases where uniqueness generally fails to hold in the class of functions that grow at most polynomially (e.g., when $h=0$), our methods provide uniqueness within the class of functions that, in addition, have compact level sets. The results are new even in the following special cases: (1) The one-dimensional case $k=p=1$, $\mathbb{X}=\mathbb{Y}=\mathbb{R}_+$; (2) The first-order case $\Sigma=0$; (3) The case where $\ell$ and $h$ are linear. The proofs combine probabilistic arguments and viscosity solution methods. Our framework covers a wide range of diffusion control problems that arise from queueing networks in heavy traffic.",0
"Contributions of $D$ waves to physical observables for neutral pion photoproduction from the proton in the near-threshold region are studied and means to isolate them are proposed. Various approaches to describe the multipoles are employed --a phenomenological one, a unitary one, and heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory. The results of these approaches are compared and found to yield essentially the same answers. $D$ waves are seen to enter together with $S$ waves in a way that any means which attempt to obtain the $E_{0+}$ multipole accurately must rely on knowledge of $D$ waves and that consequently the latter cannot be dismissed in analyses of low-energy pion photoproduction. It is shown that $D$ waves have a significant impact on double-polarization observables that can be measured. This importance of $D$ waves is due to the soft nature of the $S$ wave and is a direct consequence of chiral symmetry and the Nambu--Goldstone nature of the pion. $F$-wave contributions are shown to be negligible in the near-threshold region.",0
"We explicitly calculate the one-loop effective potential for the supersymmetric topologically massive gauge theory in four dimensions, where the chiral scalar superfield is directly coupled to the field strength for the gauge spinor superfield.",0
We examine some of the subtleties inherent in formulating a theory of spinors on a manifold with a smooth degenerate metric. We concentrate on the case where the metric is singular on a hypersurface that partitions the manifold into Lorentzian and Euclidean domains. We introduce the notion of a complex spinor fibration to make precise the meaning of continuity of a spinor field and give an expression for the components of a local spinor connection that is valid in the absence of a frame of local orthonormal vectors. These considerations enable one to construct a Dirac equation for the discussion of the behavior of spinors in the vicinity of the metric degeneracy. We conclude that the theory contains more freedom than the spacetime Dirac theory and we discuss some of the implications of this for the continuity of conserved currents.,0
"We present studies in bottomonium spectroscopy carried out with samples of $(98\pm1)$ million $\Upsilon(2S)$ and $(121\pm1)$ million $\Upsilon(3S)$ events recorded with the BaBar detector at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy $e^+ e^-$ collider at SLAC. Precise measurements of the branching fractions for $\chi_{b1,2}(1P, 2P)\rightarrow \gamma \Upsilon(1S)$ and $\chi_{b1,2}(2P)\rightarrow \gamma \Upsilon(2S)$ transitions, and searches for radiative decay to the $\eta_b(1S)$ and $\eta_b(2S)$ states are performed using photons that have converted into an $e^+ e^-$ pair. In addition, we summarize the results of a search for the spin-singlet partner of the $\chi_{bJ}(1P)$ triplet, the $h_b(1P)$ state of bottomonium, in the transitions $\Upsilon(3S)\rightarrow \pi^0 h_b$ and $\Upsilon(3S)\rightarrow \pi^+\pi^- h_b$.",0
"Let $K$ be a field of characteristic zero, $X$ and $Y$ be smooth $K$-varieties, and let $G$ be a algebraic $K$-group. Given two algebraic morphisms $\varphi:X\rightarrow G$ and $\psi:Y\rightarrow G$, we define their convolution $\varphi*\psi:X\times Y\to G$ by $\varphi*\psi(x,y)=\varphi(x)\cdot\psi(y)$. We then show that this operation yields morphisms with improved smoothness properties. More precisely, we show that for any morphism $\varphi:X\rightarrow G$ which is dominant when restricted to each absolutely irreducible component of $X$, by convolving it with itself finitely many times, one can obtain a flat morphism with reduced fibers of rational singularities, generalizing the main result of our previous paper. Uniform bounds on families of morphisms are given as well. Moreover, as a key analytic step, we also prove the following result in motivic integration; if $\{f_{\mathbb{Q}_{p}}:\mathbb{Q}_{p}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}\}_{p\in\mathrm{primes}}$ is a collection of functions which is motivic in the sense of Denef-Pas, and $f_{\mathbb{Q}_{p}}$ is $L^{1}$ for any $p$ large enough, then in fact there exists $\epsilon>0$ such that $f_{\mathbb{Q}_{p}}$ is $L^{1+\epsilon}$ for any $p$ large enough.",0
A possible explanation of the present discrepancy between the abundance of galactic subhaloes predicted by N-Body simulations with those observed in the Local Group is presented. We study the impact of an early reionization on the baryonic component of the Universe using SPH simulations on group and galactic scales. We use a simplified model for reionization described as an instantaneous increment of the IGM temperature (with 1e5<T_{IGM}<1e6 K) at a given redshift (z_r > 8). We find that a key role is played by compton cooling (interaction between hot electrons and the CMB photons); at high redshift (z_r>10) this cooling is very efficient and it is able to counteract any heating of the gas within few Myrs. This means that a late reionization is needed (z_r<9) to sufficiently reduce the number of luminous dwarf satellites around our Galaxy. For a reionization redshift z_r=8 and a reionization temperature of T_{IGM}~1e5 K we are able to reproduce the observed number of Local Group dwarf galaxies in our simulations.,0
"It is well known that n bits of entropy are necessary and sufficient to perfectly encrypt n bits (one-time pad). Even if we allow the encryption to be approximate, the amount of entropy needed doesn't asymptotically change. However, this is not the case when we are encrypting quantum bits. For the perfect encryption of n quantum bits, 2n bits of entropy are necessary and sufficient (quantum one-time pad), but for approximate encryption one asymptotically needs only n bits of entropy. In this paper, we provide the optimal trade-off between the approximation measure epsilon and the amount of classical entropy used in the encryption of single quantum bits. Then, we consider n-qubit encryption schemes which are a composition of independent single-qubit ones and provide the optimal schemes both in the 2- and the operator-norm. Moreover, we provide a counterexample to show that the encryption scheme of Ambainis-Smith based on small-bias sets does not work in the operator-norm.",0
"Advancements in deep learning enable cloud servers to provide inference-as-a-service for clients. In this scenario, clients send their raw data to the server to run the deep learning model and send back the results. One standing challenge in this setting is to ensure the privacy of the clients' sensitive data. Oblivious inference is the task of running the neural network on the client's input without disclosing the input or the result to the server. This paper introduces XONN, a novel end-to-end framework based on Yao's Garbled Circuits (GC) protocol, that provides a paradigm shift in the conceptual and practical realization of oblivious inference. In XONN, the costly matrix-multiplication operations of the deep learning model are replaced with XNOR operations that are essentially free in GC. We further provide a novel algorithm that customizes the neural network such that the runtime of the GC protocol is minimized without sacrificing the inference accuracy. We design a user-friendly high-level API for XONN, allowing expression of the deep learning model architecture in an unprecedented level of abstraction. Extensive proof-of-concept evaluation on various neural network architectures demonstrates that XONN outperforms prior art such as Gazelle (USENIX Security'18) by up to 7x, MiniONN (ACM CCS'17) by 93x, and SecureML (IEEE S&P'17) by 37x. State-of-the-art frameworks require one round of interaction between the client and the server for each layer of the neural network, whereas, XONN requires a constant round of interactions for any number of layers in the model. XONN is first to perform oblivious inference on Fitnet architectures with up to 21 layers, suggesting a new level of scalability compared with state-of-the-art. Moreover, we evaluate XONN on four datasets to perform privacy-preserving medical diagnosis.",0
"The time evolution of the number density of galaxy clusters and their mass and temperature functions are used to constrain cosmological parameters in the spatially flat dark matter models containing a fraction of hot particles (massive neutrino) additional to cold and baryonic matter. We test the modified MDM models with cosmic gravitational waves and show that they neither pass the cluster evolution test nor reproduce the observed height of the first acoustic peak in $\Delta T/T$ spectrum, and therefore should be ruled out. The models with a non-zero cosmological constant are in better agreement with observations. We estimate the free cosmological parameters in $\Lambda$MDM with a negligible abundance of gravitational waves, and find that within the parameter ranges $h\in (0.6, 0.7)$, $n\in (0.9, 1.1)$, (i) the value of $\Omega_\Lambda$ is strongly affected by a small fraction of hot dark matter, $f_\nu\equiv\Omega_\nu /\Omega_m\in (0, 0.2)$: $0.45 <\Omega_\Lambda <0.7$ ($1\sigma$ CL), and (ii) the redshift evolution of galaxy clusters alone reveals the following explicit correlation between $\Omega_\Lambda$ and $f_\nu$: $\Omega_\Lambda +0.5f_\nu =0.65\pm 0.1$. The present accuracy of observational data allows only to bound the fraction of hot matter, $f_\nu\in (0, 0.2)$ (the number of massive neutrino species remains undelimited, $N_\nu =1, 2, 3$).",0
"We propose a new method to implement the running coupling constant in the JIMWLK equation, imposing the scale dependence on the correlation function of the random noise in the Langevin formulation. We interpret this scale choice as the transverse momentum of the emitted gluon in one step of the evolution and show that it is related to the """"Balitsky"""" prescription for the BK equation. This slows down the evolution speed of a practical solution of the JIMWLK equation, bringing it closer to the x-dependence inferred from fits to HERA data. We further study our proposal by a numerical comparison of the BK and JIMWLK equations.",0
Any three circles theorem for discrete harmonic functions must contain an inherent error term. In this paper we find the sharp error term in an $L^2$-three circles theorem for harmonic functions defined in $\Zb^2$. The proof is highly indirect due to combinatorial obstacles and cancellations phenomena. We exploit Newton interpolation methods and recursive arguments.,0
"We deal with the minimization of the ${\mathcal H}_\infty$-norm of the transfer function of a parameter-dependent descriptor system over the set of admissible parameter values. Subspace frameworks are proposed for such minimization problems where the involved systems are of large order. The proposed algorithms are greedy interpolatory approaches inspired by our recent work [Aliyev et al., SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 38(4):1496--1516, 2017] for the computation of the ${\mathcal H}_\infty$-norm. In this work, we minimize the ${\mathcal H}_\infty$-norm of a reduced-order parameter-dependent system obtained by two-sided restrictions onto certain subspaces. Then we expand the subspaces so that Hermite interpolation properties hold between the full and reduced-order system at the optimal parameter value for the reduced order system. We formally establish the superlinear convergence of the subspace frameworks under some smoothness assumptions. The fast convergence of the proposed frameworks in practice is illustrated by several large-scale systems.",0
"Statistics of photons emitted by mobile excitons in individual carbon nanotubes are investigated. Photoluminescence spectroscopy is used to identify the chiralities and suspended lengths of air-suspended nanotubes, and photon correlation measurements are performed at room temperature on telecommunication-wavelength nanotube emission with a Hanbury-Brown-Twiss setup. We obtain zero-delay second-order correlation $g^{(2)}(0)$ less than 0.5, indicating single photon generation. Excitation power dependence of the photon antibunching characteristics is examined for nanotubes with various chiralities and suspended lengths, where we find that the minimum value of $g^{(2)}(0)$ is obtained at the lowest power. The influence of exciton diffusion and end quenching is studied by Monte Carlo simulations, and we derive an analytical expression for the minimum value of $g^{(2)}(0)$. Our results indicate that mobile excitons in micron-long nanotubes can in principle produce high-purity single photons, leading to new design strategies for quantum photon sources.",0
"In many ways, the HR8799 system resembles our Solar system more closely than any other discovered to date - albeit on a larger, younger, and more dramatic scale - featuring four giant planets and two debris belts. The first belt lies beyond the orbit of the outer planet, and mirrors our Solar system's Edgeworth-Kuiper belt. The second belt lies interior to the orbit of the inner planet, HR8799e, and is analogous to our Asteroid Belt. With such a similar architecture, the system is a valuable laboratory for examining exoplanet dynamics, and the interaction between debris disks and planets. In recent years, HR8799's outer disk has been relatively well characterised, primarily using the Herschel Space Observatory. In contrast, the inner disk, too close to HR8799 to be spatially resolved by Herschel, remains poorly understood. This leaves significant questions over both the location of the planetesimals responsible for producing the observed dust, and the physical properties of those grains. We have performed extensive simulations of HR8799's inner, unresolved debris belt, using UNSW Australia's supercomputing facility, Katana. Here, we present the results of integrations following the evolution of a belt of dynamically hot debris interior to the orbit of HR8799e, for a period of 60 Myr, using an initial population of 500,000 massless test particles. These simulations have enable the characterisation of the extent and structure of the inner belt, revealing that its outer edge must lie interior to the 3:1 mean-motion resonance with HR8799, at approximately 7.5au, and highlighting the presence of fine structure analogous to the Solar system's Kirkwood gaps. In the future, out results will allow us to calculate a first estimate of the small-body impact rate and water delivery prospects for any potential terrestrial planet(s) that might lurk, undetected, in the inner system.",0
"Association schemes are combinatorial objects that allow us solve problems in several branches of mathematics. They have been used in the study of permutation groups and graphs and also in the design of experiments, coding theory, partition designs etc. In this paper we show some techniques for computing properties of association schemes. The main framework arises from the fact that we can characterize completely the Bose-Mesner algebra in terms of a zero-dimensional ideal. A Gr\""""obner basis of this ideal can be easily derived without the use of Buchberger algorithm in an efficient way. From this statement, some nice relations arise between the treatment of zero-dimensional ideals by reordering techniques (FGLM techniques) and some properties of the schemes such as P-polynomiality, and minimal generators of the algebra.",0
"Let $G$ be a group. We denote by $\nu(G)$ a certain extension of the non-abelian tensor square $G \otimes G$ by $G \times G$. We prove that if $G$ is a finitely generated group in which the set of all simple tensors $T_{\otimes}(G)$ is finite, then the non-abelian tensor square $G \otimes G$ and the group $\nu(G)$ are finite. Moreover, we show that if $G$ is a locally residually finite group in which the set of simple tensors $T_{\otimes}(H)$ is finite for every proper finitely generated subgroup $H$ of $G$, then the group $\nu(G)$ is locally finite.",0
"We use Monte Carlo simulations to study properties of Anderson's resonating-valence-bond (RVB) spin-liquid state on the square lattice (i.e., the equal superposition of all pairing of spins into nearest-neighbor singlet pairs) and compare with the classical dimer model (CDM). The latter system also corresponds to the ground state of the Rokhsar-Kivelson quantum dimer model at its critical point. We find that although spin-spin correlations decay exponentially in the RVB, four-spin valence-bond-solid (VBS) correlations are critical, qualitatively like the well-known dimer-dimer correlations of the CDM, but decaying more slowly (as $1/r^a$ with $a \approx 1.20$, compared with $a=2$ for the CDM). We also compute the distribution of monomer (defect) pair separations, which decay by a larger exponent in the RVB than in the CDM. We further study both models in their different winding number sectors and evaluate the relative weights of different sectors. Like the CDM, all the observed RVB behaviors can be understood in the framework of a mapping to a """"height"""" model characterized by a gradient-squared stiffness constant $K$. Four independent measurements consistently show a value $K_{RVB} \approx 1.6 K_{CDM}$, with the same kinds of numerical evaluations of $K_{CDM}$ give results in agreement with the rigorously known value $K_{CDM}=\pi/16$. The background of a nonzero winding number gradient $W/L$ introduces spatial anisotropies and an increase in the effective K, both of which can be understood as a consequence of anharmonic terms in the height-model free energy, which are of relevance to the recently proposed scenario of """"Cantor deconfinement"""" in extended quantum dimer models. We also study ensembles in which fourth-neighbor (bipartite) bonds are allowed, at a density controlled by a tunable fugacity, resulting (as expected) in a smooth reduction of K.",0
"We determine the Thurston's geometry possesed by any Seifert fibered conemanifold structure in a Seifert manifold with orbit space $S^2$ and no more than three exceptional fibres, whose singular set, composed by fibres, has at most 3 components which can include exceptional or general fibres (the total number of exceptional and singular fibres is less or equal than three). We also give the method to obtain the holonomy of that structure. We apply these results to three families of Seifert manifolds, namely, spherical, Nil manifolds and manifolds obtained by Dehn surgery in a torus knot $K_{(r,s)}$. As a consequence we generalize to all torus knots the results obtained in \cite{LM2015} for the case of the left handle trefoil knot. We associate a plot to each torus knot for the different geometries, in the spirit of Thurston.",0
"We construct perfect fluid tori in the field of the Kehagias-Sfetsos (K-S) naked singularity representing spherically symmetric vacuum solution of the modified Ho\v{r}ava quantum gravity that is characterized by a dimensionless parameter $\omega M^2$, combining the gravitational mass parameter $M$ of the spacetime with the Ho\v{r}ava parameter $\omega$ reflecting the role of the quantum corrections. In dependence on the value of $\omega M^2$, the K-S naked singularities demonstrate a variety of qualitatively different behavior of their circular geodesics that is fully reflected in the properties of the toroidal structures. In all of the K-S naked singularity spacetimes the tori are located above an """"antigravity"""" sphere where matter can stay in stable equilibrium position, that is relevant for the stability of the orbiting fluid toroidal accretion structures.",0
"Variance function estimation in nonparametric regression is considered and the minimax rate of convergence is derived. We are particularly interested in the effect of the unknown mean on the estimation of the variance function. Our results indicate that, contrary to the common practice, it is not desirable to base the estimator of the variance function on the residuals from an optimal estimator of the mean when the mean function is not smooth. Instead it is more desirable to use estimators of the mean with minimal bias. On the other hand, when the mean function is very smooth, our numerical results show that the residual-based method performs better, but not substantial better than the first-order-difference-based estimator. In addition our asymptotic results also correct the optimal rate claimed in Hall and Carroll [J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 51 (1989) 3--14].",0
"We examine a criterion for the anyonic superconductivity at zero temperature in Abelian matter-coupled Chern-Simons gauge field theories in three dimensions. By solving the Dyson-Schwinger equations, we obtain a critical value of the statistical charge for the superconducting phase in a massless fermion-Chern-Simons model.",0
"We report on a population of X-ray weak quasars with similar UV emission-line properties to those of the remarkable quasar PHL 1811. All radio-quiet PHL 1811 analogs are notably X-ray weak by a mean factor of ~13, with hints of heavy X-ray absorption. Correlations between the X-ray weakness and UV emission-line properties suggest that PHL 1811 analogs may have extreme wind-dominated broad emission-line regions (BELRs). We propose an AGN geometry that can potentially unify the PHL 1811 analogs and the general population of weak-line quasars.",0
"Born in rapidly evolving mini-halos during the first billion years of the Universe, super- massive black holes (SMBH) feed from gas flows spanning many orders of magnitude, from the cosmic web in which they are embedded to their event horizon. As such, accretion onto SMBHs constitutes a formidable challenge to tackle numerically, and currently requires the use of sub-grid models to handle the flow on small, unresolved scales. In this paper, we study the impact of resolution on the accretion pattern of SMBHs initially inserted at the heart of dense galactic gas clouds, using a custom super-Lagrangian refinement scheme to resolve the black hole (BH) gravitational zone of influence. We find that once the self-gravitating gas cloud host is sufficiently well re- solved, accretion onto the BH is driven by the cloud internal structure, independently of the BH seed mass, provided dynamical friction is present during the early stages of cloud collapse. For a pristine gas mix of hydrogen and helium, a slim disc develops around the BH on sub-parsec scales, turning the otherwise chaotic BH accretion duty cycle into an episodic one, with potentially important consequences for BH feedback. In the presence of such a nuclear disc, BH mass growth predominantly occurs when infalling dense clumps trigger disc instabilities, fuelling intense albeit short-lived gas accretion episodes.",0
"Nanometer circuits are becoming increasingly susceptible to soft-errors due to alpha-particle and atmospheric neutron strikes as device scaling reduces node capacitances and supply/threshold voltage scaling reduces noise margins. It is becoming crucial to add soft-error tolerance estimation and optimization to the design flow to handle the increasing susceptibility. The first part of this paper presents a tool for accurate soft-error tolerance analysis of nanometer circuits (ASERTA) that can be used to estimate the soft-error tolerance of nanometer circuits consisting of millions of gates. The tolerance estimates generated by the tool match SPICE generated estimates closely while taking orders of magnitude less computation time. The second part of the paper presents a tool for soft-error tolerance optimization of nanometer circuits (SERTOPT) using the tolerance estimates generated by ASERTA. The tool finds optimal sizes, channel lengths, supply voltages and threshold voltages to be assigned to gates in a combinational circuit such that the soft-error tolerance is increased while meeting the timing constraint. Experiments on ISCAS'85 benchmark circuits showed that soft-error rate of the optimized circuit decreased by as much as 47% with marginal increase in circuit delay.",0
"We provide a general framework for getting expected linear time constant factor approximations (and in many cases FPTAS's) to several well known problems in Computational Geometry, such as $k$-center clustering and farthest nearest neighbor. The new approach is robust to variations in the input problem, and yet it is simple, elegant and practical. In particular, many of these well studied problems which fit easily into our framework, either previously had no linear time approximation algorithm, or required rather involved algorithms and analysis. A short list of the problems we consider include farthest nearest neighbor, $k$-center clustering, smallest disk enclosing $k$ points, $k$th largest distance, $k$th smallest $m$-nearest neighbor distance, $k$th heaviest edge in the MST and other spanning forest type problems, problems involving upward closed set systems, and more. Finally, we show how to extend our framework such that the linear running time bound holds with high probability.",0
"Multiple types of high quality neutron detectors are proposed for the first phase of the China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS), which will be commissioned in 2018. Considering the shortage of 3He supply, a detector module composed of 49 boron-coated straws (BCS) was developed by Proportional Technologies Inc. (PTI). Each straw has a length of 1000 mm and a diameter of 7.5 mm. Seven straws are tightly packed in a tube, and seven tubes are organized in a row to form a detector module. The charge division method is used for longitudinal positioning. A specific readout system was utilized to output the signal and simultaneously encode each straw. The performance of this detector module was studied using a moderated 252Cf source at the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP). The signal amplitude spectrum indicates its n-gamma discrimination capability. Despite the complex readout method, a longitudinal resolution of 6.1-0.5 mm was obtained. The three-dimensional positioning ability qualifies this BCS detector module as a promising neutron scattering spectrometer detector.",0
"Embedded contact knot homology (ECK) is a variation on Embedded contact homology (ECH), defined with respect to an open book decomposition compatible with a contact structure on some 3-manifold, M. The knot in question is given by the (null-homologous) binding of the open book and the chain complex is defined in terms of closed orbits of the Reeb vector field and certain pseudoholomorphic curves in the symplectization of the knot complement. In this thesis we first generalize this construction to the case of rational open book decompositions, allowing us to define ECK for rationally null-homologous knots. In its most general form this is a bi-filtered chain complex whose homology yields ECH of the closed manifold. There is also a hat version of ECK in this situation which is equipped with an Alexander grading equivalent to that in the Heegaard Floer setting, categorifies the Alexander polynomial, and is conjecturally isomorphic to the hat version of knot Floer homology, HFK. The main result of this thesis is a large negative n-surgery formula for ECK. Namely, we start with an (integral) open book decomposition of a manifold with binding K and compute, for large n, ECK of the knot K(-n) obtained by performing (-n)-surgery on K. This formula agrees with Hedden's large n-surgery formula for HFK, providing supporting evidence towards the conjectured equivalence between the two theories. Along the way, we also prove that ECK is, in many cases, independent of the choices made to define it, namely the almost complex structure on the symplectization and the homotopy type of the contact form. We also prove that, in the case of integral open book decompositions, the hat version of ECK is supported in Alexander gradings less than or equal to twice the genus of the knot.",0
"We address the problem of coordinating online a continuous flow of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) crossing two adjacent intersections in an urban area. We present a decentralized optimal control framework whose solution yields for each vehicle the optimal acceleration/deceleration at any time in the sense of minimizing fuel consumption. The solu- tion, when it exists, allows the vehicles to cross the intersections without the use of traffic lights, without creating congestion on the connecting road, and under the hard safety constraint of collision avoidance. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is validated through simulation considering two intersections located in downtown Boston, and it is shown that coordination of CAVs can reduce significantly both fuel consumption and travel time.",0
"The motion equation with nonzero mass, invariant for weak isospin transformation, can be obtained from the Dirac equation by the adding of the Clifford pentad fifth element. The motion equation of the SU(2) Yang-Mills field components is similar to the Klein-Gordon equation with the nonzero mass.",0
"In this research a new algebraic semantics of rough set theory including additional meta aspects is proposed. The semantics is based on enhancing the standard rough set theory with notions of 'relative ability of subsets of approximation spaces to approximate'. The eventual algebraic semantics is developed via many deep results in convexity in ordered structures. A new variation of rough set theory, namely 'ill-posed rough set theory' in which it may suffice to know some of the approximations of sets, is eventually introduced.",0
"We present a method to perform stability analysis of nonequilibrium fixed points appearing in self-consistent electron transport calculations. The nonequilibrium fixed points are given by the self-consistent solution of stationary, nonlinear kinetic equation for single-particle density matrix. We obtain the stability matrix by linearizing the kinetic equation around the fixed points and analyze the real part of its spectrum to assess the asymptotic time behavior of the fixed points. We derive expressions for the stability matrices within Hartree-Fock and linear response adiabatic time-dependent density functional theory. The stability analysis of multiple fixed points is performed within the nonequilibrium Hartree-Fock approximation for the electron transport through a molecule with a spin-degenerate single level with local Coulomb interaction.",0
"The Gum Nebula is 36 degree wide shell-like emission nebula at a distance of only 450 pc. It has been hypothesised to be an old supernova remnant, fossil HII region, wind-blown bubble, or combination of multiple objects. Here we investigate the magneto-ionic properties of the nebula using data from recent surveys: radio-continuum data from the NRAO VLA and S-band Parkes All Sky Surveys, and H-alpha data from the Southern H-Alpha Sky Survey Atlas. We model the upper part of the nebula as a spherical shell of ionised gas expanding into the ambient medium. We perform a maximum-likelihood Markov chain Monte-Carlo fit to the NVSS rotation measure data, using the H-halpha data to constrain average electron density in the shell $n_e$. Assuming a latitudinal background gradient in RM we find $n_e=1.3^{+0.4}_{-0.4} {\rm cm}^{-3}$, angular radius $\phi_{\rm outer}=22.7^{+0.1}_{-0.1} {\rm deg}$, shell thickness $dr=18.5^{+1.5}_{-1.4} {\rm pc}$, ambient magnetic field strength $B_0=3.9^{+4.9}_{-2.2} \mu{\rm G}$ and warm gas filling factor $f=0.3^{+0.3}_{-0.1}$. We constrain the local, small-scale (~260 pc) pitch-angle of the ordered Galactic magnetic field to $+7^{\circ}\lesssim\wp\lesssim+44^{\circ}$, which represents a significant deviation from the median field orientation on kiloparsec scales (~-7.2$^{\circ}$). The moderate compression factor $X=6.0\,^{+5.1}_{-2.5}$ at the edge of the H-alpha shell implies that the 'old supernova remnant' origin is unlikely. Our results support a model of the nebula as a HII region around a wind-blown bubble. Analysis of depolarisation in 2.3 GHz S-PASS data is consistent with this hypothesis and our best-fitting values agree well with previous studies of interstellar bubbles.",0
"We present a new action recognition deep neural network which adaptively learns the best action velocities in addition to the classification. While deep neural networks have reached maturity for image understanding tasks, we are still exploring network topologies and features to handle the richer environment of video clips. Here, we tackle the problem of multiple velocities in action recognition, and provide state-of-the-art results for gesture recognition, on known and new collected datasets. We further provide the training steps for our semi-supervised network, suited to learn from huge unlabeled datasets with only a fraction of labeled examples.",0
"In this note we discuss two aspects of screw dislocations dynamics: their behavior near the boundary and a way to confine them inside the material. In the former case, we obtain analytical results on the estimates of collision times (one dislocation with the boundary and two dislocations with opposite Burgers vectors with each other); numerical evidence is also provided. In the latter, we obtain analytical results stating that, under imposing a certain type of boundary conditions, it is energetically favorable for dislocations to remain confined inside the domain.",0
"We describe two quantum channels that individually cannot send any information, even classical, without some chance of decoding error. But together a single use of each channel can send quantum information perfectly reliably. This proves that the zero-error classical capacity exhibits superactivation, the extreme form of the superadditivity phenomenon in which entangled inputs allow communication over zero capacity channels. But our result is stronger still, as it even allows zero-error quantum communication when the two channels are combined. Thus our result shows a new remarkable way in which entanglement across two systems can be used to resist noise, in this case perfectly. We also show a new form of superactivation by entanglement shared between sender and receiver.",0
"We calculate form factors relevant for rare B decays using moving-NRQCD for the b quark and the AsqTad action for the light quarks. Moving NRQCD allows us to work directly with the physical b quark mass and go to higher recoil momentum compared to standard NRQCD. Here, we show first results for the matrix elements and the operator matching coefficients. Some difficulties and possible ways of improvement are discussed.",0
"X-ray analysis of ferroelectric thin layers of Ba1/2Sr1/2TiO3 with different thickness reveals the presence of internal strain gradients across the film thickness and allows us to propose a functional form for the internal strain profile. We use this to calculate the direct influence of strain gradient, through flexoelectric coupling, on the degradation of the ferroelectric properties of thin films with decreasing thickness, in excellent agreement with the observed behaviour. This work highlights the link between strain relaxation and strain gradients in epitaxial films, and shows the pressing need to avoid strain gradients in order to obtain thin ferroelectrics with bulk-like properties.",0
"Bacterial processes ranging from gene expression to motility and biofilm formation are constantly challenged by internal and external noise. While the importance of stochastic fluctuations has been appreciated for chemotaxis, it is currently believed that deterministic long-range fluid dynamical effects govern cell-cell and cell-surface scattering - the elementary events that lead to swarming and collective swimming in active suspensions and to the formation of biofilms. Here, we report the first direct measurements of the bacterial flow field generated by individual swimming Escherichia coli both far from and near to a solid surface. These experiments allowed us to examine the relative importance of fluid dynamics and rotational diffusion for bacteria. For cell-cell interactions it is shown that thermal and intrinsic stochasticity drown the effects of long-range fluid dynamics, implying that physical interactions between bacteria are determined by steric collisions and near-field lubrication forces. This dominance of short-range forces closely links collective motion in bacterial suspensions to self-organization in driven granular systems, assemblages of biofilaments, and animal flocks. For the scattering of bacteria with surfaces, long-range fluid dynamical interactions are also shown to be negligible before collisions; however, once the bacterium swims along the surface within a few microns after an aligning collision, hydrodynamic effects can contribute to the experimentally observed, long residence times. As these results are based on purely mechanical properties, they apply to a wide range of microorganisms.",0
"For a link $L$ in the 3-sphere and for a prime $p$, we express the $p$-primary information on the first homology group of $p^{m}$-fold branched covers of $L$ in terms of its $p$-adic Milnor higher linking invariants, using the completed Alexander module of the pro-$p$ completion of the link group of $L$.",0
"The electronic functionality of thin films is governed by their interfaces. This is very important for the ferroelectric (FE) state which depends on thin-film clamping and interfacial charge transfer. Here we show that in a heterostructure consisting of a nano-granular metal and an organic FE layer of [tetrathiafulvalene]$^{+\delta}$[p-chloranil]$^{-\delta}$ the nano-granular layer's conductance provides a sensitive and non-invasive probe of the temperature-dependent dielectric properties of the FE layer. We provide a theoretical framework that is able to qualitatively reproduce the observed conductance changes taking the anisotropy of the dielectric anomaly at the paraelectric(PE)-FE phase transition into account. The approach is also suitable for observing dynamical effects close to the phase transition. Focused electron beam induced deposition as fabrication method for the nano-granular metal guarantees excellent down-scaling capabilities, so that monitoring the FE state on the lateral scale down to 20--30\,nm can be envisioned.",0
We consider the problem of recovering the unknown noise variance in the linear regression model. To estimate the nuisance (a vector of regression coefficients) we use a family of spectral regularisers of the maximum likelihood estimator. The noise estimation is based on the adaptive normalisation of the squared error. We derive the upper bound for the concentration of the proposed method around the ideal estimator (the case of zero nuisance).,0
"We use runtime verification (RV) to check various specifications in a smart apartment. The specifications can be broken down into three types: behavioral correctness of the apartment sensors, detection of specific user activities (known as activities of daily living), and composition of specifications of the previous types. The context of the smart apartment provides us with a complex system with a large number of components with two different hierarchies to group specifications and sensors: geographically within the same room, floor or globally in the apartment, and logically following the different types of specifications. We leverage a recent approach to decentralized RV of decentralized specifications, where monitors have their own specifications and communicate together to verify more general specifications. We leverage the hierarchies, modularity and re-use afforded by decentralized specifications to: (1) scale beyond existing centralized RV techniques, and (2) greatly reduce computation and communication costs.",0
"(Abridged) We trace the interaction processes of galaxies at intermediate redshift by measuring the irregularity of their ionized gas kinematics, and investigate these irregularities as a function of the environment (cluster versus field) and of morphological type (spiral versus irregular). Our sample consists of 92 distant galaxies. 16 cluster (z~0.3 and z~0.5) and 29 field galaxies (mean z=0.44) of these have velocity fields with sufficient signal to be analyzed. We find that the fraction of galaxies that have irregular gas kinematics is remarkably similar in galaxy clusters and in the field at intermediate redshifts. The distribution of the field and cluster galaxies in (ir)regularity parameters space is also similar. On the other hand galaxies with small central concentration of light, that we see in the field sample, are absent in the cluster sample. We find that field galaxies at intermediate redshifts have more irregular velocity fields as well as more clumpy and less centrally concentrated light distributions than their local counterparts. Comparison with a SINS sample of 11 z ~ 2 galaxies shows that these distant galaxies have more irregular gas kinematics than our intermediate redshift cluster and field sample. We do not find a dependence of the irregularities in gas kinematics on morphological type. We find that two different indicators of star formation correlate with irregularity in the gas kinematics. More irregular gas kinematics, also more clumpy and less centrally concentrated light distributions of spiral field galaxies at intermediate redshifts in comparison to their local counterparts indicate that these galaxies are probably still in the process of building their disks via mechanisms such as accretion and mergers. On the other hand, they have less irregular gas kinematics compared to galaxies at z ~ 2.",0
"This paper proposes a controlled experiment to further investigate the usefulness of gaze awareness and gesture recognition in the support of collaborative work at a distance. We propose to redesign experiments conducted several years ago with more recent technology that would: a) enable to better study of the integration of communication modalities, b) allow users to freely move while collaborating at a distance and c) avoid asymmetries of communication between collaborators.",0
"We analyze how the recent precise hadronic tau-decay data on the V-A spectral function and general properties of QCD such as analyticity, the operator product expansion and chiral perturbation theory (ChPT), can be used to improve the knowledge of some of the low-energy constants of ChPT. In particular we find the most precise values of L_{9,10} (or equivalently l_{5,6}) at order p^4 and p^6 and the first phenomenological determination of C_87 (c_50).",0
"In a number of recent papers, the idea of generalized boundaries has found use in fractal and in multiresolution analysis; many of the papers having a focus on specific examples. Parallel with this new insight, and motivated by quantum probability, there has also been much research which seeks to study fractal and multiresolution structures with the use of certain systems of non-commutative operators; non-commutative harmonic/stochastic analysis. This in turn entails combinatorial, graph operations, and branching laws. The most versatile, of these non-commutative algebras are the Cuntz algebras; denoted $\mathcal{O}_{N}$, $N$ for the number of isometry generators. $N$ is at least 2. Our focus is on the representations of $\mathcal{O}_{N}$. We aim to develop new non-commutative tools, involving both representation theory and stochastic processes. They serve to connect these parallel developments. In outline, boundaries, Poisson, or Martin, are certain measure spaces (often associated to random walk models), designed to encode the asymptotic behavior, e.g., how trajectories diverge when the number of steps goes to infinity. We stress that our present boundaries (commutative or non-commutative) are purely measure-theoretical objects. Although, as we show, in some cases our boundaries may be compared with more familiar topological boundaries.",0
"Let $\bm X=(X_1,...,X_d)$ be a random vector, whose components are not necessarily independent nor are they required to have identical distribution functions $F_1,...,F_d$. Denote by $N_s$ the number of exceedances among $X_1,...,X_d$ above a high threshold $s$. The fragility index, defined by $FI=\lim_{s\nearrow}E(N_s\mid N_s>0)$ if this limit exists, measures the asymptotic stability of the stochastic system $\bm X$ as the threshold increases. The system is called stable if $FI=1$ and fragile otherwise. In this paper we show that the asymptotic conditional distribution of exceedance counts (ACDEC) $p_k=\lim_{s\nearrow}P(N_s=k\mid N_s>0)$, $1\le k\le d$, exists, if the copula of $\bm X$ is in the domain of attraction of a multivariate extreme value distribution, and if $\lim_{s\nearrow}(1-F_i(s))/(1-F_\kappa(s))=\gamma_i\in[0,\infty)$ exists for $1\le i\le d$ and some $\kappa\in{1,...,d}$. This enables the computation of the FI corresponding to $\bm X$ and of the extended FI as well as of the asymptotic distribution of the exceedance cluster length also in that case, where the components of $\bm X$ are not identically distributed.",0
"In this paper, we provide a solution to the open problem of computing the Fourier transform of a binary function defined over $n$-bit vectors taking $m$-bit vector values. In particular, we introduce the two-modular Fourier transform (TMFT) of a binary function $f:G\rightarrow {\cal R}$, where $G = (\mathbb{F}_2^n,+)$ is the group of $n$ bit vectors with bitwise modulo two addition $+$, and ${\cal R}$ is a finite commutative ring of characteristic $2$. Using the specific group structure of $G$ and a sequence of nested subgroups of $G$, we define the fast TMFT and its inverse. Since the image ${\cal R}$ of the binary functions is a ring, we can define the convolution between two functions $f:G\rightarrow {\cal R}$. We then provide the TMFT properties, including the convolution theorem, which can be used to efficiently compute convolutions. Finally, we derive the complexity of the fast TMFT and the inverse fast TMFT.",0
"There is a common belief that the successful training of deep neural networks requires many annotated training samples, which are often expensive and difficult to obtain especially in the biomedical imaging field. While it is often easy for researchers to use data augmentation to expand the size of training sets, constructing and generating generic augmented data that is able to teach the network the desired invariance and robustness properties using traditional data augmentation techniques is challenging in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel automatic data augmentation method that uses generative adversarial networks to learn augmentations that enable machine learning based method to learn the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a coarse-to-fine generator to capture the manifold of the training sets and generate generic augmented data. In our experiments, we show the efficacy of our approach on a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) image, achieving improvements of 3.5% Dice coefficient on the BRATS15 Challenge dataset as compared to traditional augmentation approaches. Also, our proposed method successfully boosts a common segmentation network to reach the state-of-the-art performance on the BRATS15 Challenge.",0
"We report the discovery of an extremely large (R_b ~ 2""""77 ~ 4.2 kpc) core in the brightest cluster galaxy, IC 1101, of the rich galaxy cluster Abell 2029. Luminous core-S\'ersic galaxies contain depleted cores---with sizes (R_b) typically 20 - 500 pc---that are thought to be formed by coalescing black hole binaries. We fit a (double nucleus) + (spheroid) + (intermediate-scale component) + (stellar halo) model to the HST surface brightness profile of IC 1101, finding the largest core size measured in any galaxy to date. This core is an order of magnitude larger than those typically measured for core-S\'ersic galaxies. We find that the spheroid's V-band absolute magnitude (M_V) of -23.8 mag (~ 25% of the total galaxy light, i.e., including the stellar halo) is faint for the large R_b, such that the observed core is 1.02 dex ~ 3.4 sigma_s (rms scatter) larger than that estimated from the R_ b -M_V relation. The suspected scouring process has produced a large stellar mass deficit (M_def) ~ 4.9 X 10^11 M_sun, i.e., a luminosity deficit ~ 28% of the spheroid's luminosity prior to the depletion. Using IC 1101's black hole mass (M_BH) estimated from the M_BH-$\sigma$, M_BH-L and M_BH-M_* relations, we measure an excessive and unrealistically high number of dry major mergers for IC 1101 (i.e., $\mathcal{N} \ga 76$) as traced by the large M_def/M_ BH ratios of 38-101. The large core, high mass deficit and oversized M_def/M_ BH ratio of IC 1101 suggest that the depleted core was scoured by overmassive SMBH binaries with a final coalesced mass M_BH ~ (4 -10) X 10^10 M_sun, i.e., ~ (1.7- 3.2) X sigma_s larger than the black hole masses estimated using the spheroid's $\sigma$, L and M_*. The large core might be partly due to oscillatory core passages by a gravitational radiation-recoiled black hole.",0
"We investigate the implications of the SNO charged-current (CC) and electron scattering (ES) measurements of solar \br neutrino fluxes for neutrino mass and mixing parameters by performing a global and unified $\chi^2$ analysis of the solar neutrino data in the framework of two neutrino mixing. We consider both $\nu_e -\nu_{active}$ and $\nu_e -\nu_{sterile}$ solutions and perform (i) analysis of the total rates data of Cl, Ga, SK and SNO experiments and (ii) global analysis including the total rates data, the recoil electron spectrum data of SK and the CC spectrum observed at SNO. For the $\nu_e-\nu_{active}$ case the inclusion of the SNO results in the analysis of the total rates reduces(enhances) the goodness-of-fit (GOF) of the SMA(LMA) solution. The flat spectrum observed at SK further favours the LMA solution over the SMA solution and no allowed area is obtained in the SMA region at 3$\sigma$ level from the global analysis. For the $\nu_e -\nu_{sterile}$ case, with the inclusion of the SNO results, all the solutions are disfavoured with a probability of more than 99% from the total rates analysis while for the global analysis the GOF of these become much worse.",0
"This work builds on and confirms the theoretical findings of Part 1 of this paper, Moarref & Jovanovi\'c (2010). We use direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations to assess the efficacy of blowing and suction in the form of streamwise traveling waves for controlling the onset of turbulence in a channel flow. We highlight the effects of the modified base flow on the dynamics of velocity fluctuations and net power balance. Our simulations verify the theoretical predictions of Part 1 that the upstream traveling waves promote turbulence even when the uncontrolled flow stays laminar. On the other hand, the downstream traveling waves with parameters selected in Part 1 are capable of reducing the fluctuations' kinetic energy, thereby maintaining the laminar flow. In flows driven by a fixed pressure gradient, a positive net efficiency as large as 25 % relative to the uncontrolled turbulent flow can be achieved with downstream waves. Furthermore, we show that these waves can also relaminarize fully developed turbulent flows at low Reynolds numbers. We conclude that the theory developed in Part 1 for the linearized flow equations with uncertainty has considerable ability to predict full-scale phenomena.",0
The di-electron analysis for 200 GeV p+p collisions is presented in this article. The cocktail simulations of di-eletrons from light flavor meson decays and heavy flavor decays are reported and compared with data. The perspectives for di-lepton measurements in Au+Au collisions are discussed.,0
"We discuss the impact of adiabatic renormalization on the power spectrum of scalar and tensor perturbations from inflation. We show that adiabatic regularization is ambiguous as it leads to very different results, for different adiabatic subtraction schemes, both in the range $v\equiv k/(aH) \gsim 0.1$ and in the infrared regime. All these schemes agree in the far ultraviolet, $v\gg 1$. Therefore, we argue that in the far infrared regime, $v\ll 1$, the adiabatic expansion is no longer valid, and the unrenormalized spectra are the physical, measurable quantities. These findings cast some doubt on the validity of the adiabatic subtraction at horizon exit, $v=1$, to determine the perturbation spectra from inflation which has recently advocated in the literature.",0
"We prove that the algebraic connectivity a(G) of a graph embedded on a nonplanar surface satisfies a Heawood-type result. More precisely, it is shown that the algebraic connectivity of a surface S, defined as the supremum of a(G) over all graphs that can be embedded in S, is equal to the chromatic number of S. Furthermore, and with the possible exception of the Klein bottle, we prove that this bound is attained only in the case of the maximal complete graph that can be embedded in S. In the planar case, we show that, at least for some classes of graphs which include the set of regular graphs, a(G) is less than or equal to four. As an application of these results and techniques, we obtain a lower bound for the genus of Ramanujan graphs. We also present some bounds for the asymptotic behaviour of a(G) for certain classes of graphs as the number of vertices goes to infinity.",0
"Given an abelian variety J and an abelian subvariety A of J over a number field K, we study the visible elements of the Shafarevich-Tate group of A with respect to J over certain number field extension M of K. The notion of visible elements in Shafarevich-Tate group of an abelian variety was introduced by Mazur. In this article, we study the image of Visible elements of A with respect to J under the natural restriction map of the Galois cohomology of A over K to the Galois cohomology of A over M. In particular, for a fixed odd prime p, we investigate the conditions under which visible elements of order p can be produced over a quadratic extension or a degree p extension M of K.",0
Using the biquaternions algebra with involution and mutual quaternional gradients the equations of one model of electro-gravimagnetic (EGM) field are constructed on the base of Hamilton form of Maxwell equations. For this field the hypothesis of equivalence of magnetic charge to gravitational mass is implied. The equations of interaction of generated by different charges and currents EGM-fields are built. On its base the analogies of three Newton's laws are obtained. The laws of transformation and conservation of energy by interaction of fields are obtained.,0
"Power quality standards (IEEE-519) require to limit the total harmonic distortion within satisfactory range caused by power electronic based devices. Our work deals with the design of hybrid active filter to reduce current perturbations produced by power electronics based devices. The Instantaneous Active and Reactive Power Method (pq) is used to perform the identification of disturbing currents. The pq algorithm creates a reference current, whereas, this reference current is tracked by the current of the voltage source converter. The currents of the voltage source converter are controlled by hysteresis controller. Simulation results showed that the hybrid active filter can compensate the harmonic currents effectively and improve power quality.",0
"Latent semantic representations of words or paragraphs, namely the embeddings, have been widely applied to information retrieval (IR). One of the common approaches of utilizing embeddings for IR is to estimate the document-to-query (D2Q) similarity in their embeddings. As words with similar syntactic usage are usually very close to each other in the embeddings space, although they are not semantically similar, the D2Q similarity approach may suffer from the problem of """"multiple degrees of similarity"""". To this end, this paper proposes a novel approach that estimates a semantic relevance score (SEM) based on document-to-document (D2D) similarity of embeddings. As Word or Para2Vec generates embeddings by the context of words/paragraphs, the D2D similarity approach turns the task of document ranking into the estimation of similarity between content within different documents. Experimental results on standard TREC test collections show that our proposed approach outperforms strong baselines.",0
"Given a linear order $\Omega$ its automorphism group $\Aut(\Omega)$ forms a lattice-ordered group via pointwise order. Assuming the continuum to be a regular cardinal, we show that \emph{pathological} and \emph{$\omega$-transitive} (i.e. highly transitive) representations of free groups abound within \emph{large} permutation groups of linear orders. Consequently, under the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis it is then true that given any linear order $\Omega$ for which $|\Omega| = $ cof$(\Omega) = \aleph_i$ ($i \in \N$) then any permutation group that is large in $\Aut(\Omega)$ contains an $\omega$-transitive representation of $G_{\aleph_{i}^+}$ (i.e. the free group of rank $2^{\aleph_i}$). In particular, and working solely within ZFC, we show that any large subgroup of $\Aut(\Q)$ (resp. $\Aut(\R)$) contains an $\omega$-transitive and pathological representation of any free group of rank $\lambda \in [\aleph_0,2^{\aleph_0}]$ (resp. of rank $2^{\aleph_0}$). Lastly, we also find a bound on the rank of free subgroups of certain restricted direct products.",0
"We present an algorithm for treating mesh refinement interfaces in numerical relativity. We detail the behavior of the solution near such interfaces located in the strong field regions of dynamical black hole spacetimes, with particular attention to the convergence properties of the simulations. In our applications of this technique to the evolution of puncture initial data with vanishing shift, we demonstrate that it is possible to simultaneously maintain second order convergence near the puncture and extend the outer boundary beyond 100M, thereby approaching the asymptotically flat region in which boundary condition problems are less difficult and wave extraction is meaningful.",0
"We prove that, for arbitrary Dirichlet $L$-functions $L(s;\chi_1),\ldots,L(s;\chi_n)$ (including the case when $\chi_j$ is equivalent to $\chi_l$ for $j\ne k$), suitable shifts of type $L(s+i\alpha_jt^{a_j}\log^{b_j}t;\chi_j)$ can simultaneously approximate any given analytic functions on a simply connected compact subset of the right open half of the critical strip, provided the pairs $(a_j,b_j)$ are distinct and satisfy certain conditions. Moreover, we consider a discrete analogue of this problem where $t$ runs over the set of positive integers.",0
"Variable selection is an old and pervasive problem in regression analysis. One solution is to impose a lasso penalty to shrink parameter estimates toward zero and perform continuous model selection. The lasso-penalized mixture of linear regressions model (L-MLR) is a class of regularization methods for the model selection problem in the fixed number of variables setting. In this article, we propose a new algorithm for the maximum penalized-likelihood estimation of the L-MLR model. This algorithm is constructed via the minorization--maximization algorithm paradigm. Such a construction allows for coordinate-wise updates of the parameter components, and produces globally convergent sequences of estimates that generate monotonic sequences of penalized log-likelihood values. These three features are missing in the previously presented approximate expectation-maximization algorithms. The previous difficulty in producing a globally convergent algorithm for the maximum penalized-likelihood estimation of the L-MLR model is due to the intractability of finding exact updates for the mixture model mixing proportions in the maximization-step. In our algorithm, we solve this issue by showing that it can be converted into a polynomial root finding problem. Our solution to this problem involves a polynomial basis conversion that is interesting in its own right. The method is tested in simulation and with an application to Major League Baseball salary data from the 1990s and the present day. We explore the concept of whether player salaries are associated with batting performance.",0
"Partially exchangeable sequences representable as mixtures of Markov chains are completely specified by de Finetti's mixing measure.

"We develop the concept of a Cheeger deformation on the context of fiber bundles with compact structure group.

"Generalizing the procedures of Girifalco and of Verheijen et al. and using results of the preceding work it has been derived the interaction potential between the molecules of different fullerenes Cn and Cm at orientationally disordered (high-temperature solid and gaseous) phases. We have calculated the coefficients for interactions of the C60 molecule with the molecules of higher fullerenes from C70 to C96 and with the smaller one, C36. The dependence of the minimum point and of the depth of the potential well on the numbers of the atoms in the molecules m and n has been investigated.",0
"This paper investigates the joint localization, detection, and tracking of sound events using a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN). We use a CRNN previously proposed for the localization and detection of stationary sources, and show that the recurrent layers enable the spatial tracking of moving sources when trained with dynamic scenes. The tracking performance of the CRNN is compared with a stand-alone tracking method that combines a multi-source (DOA) estimator and a particle filter. Their respective performance is evaluated in various acoustic conditions such as anechoic and reverberant scenarios, stationary and moving sources at several angular velocities, and with a varying number of overlapping sources. The results show that the CRNN manages to track multiple sources more consistently than the parametric method across acoustic scenarios, but at the cost of higher localization error.",0
"Many users in online social networks are constantly trying to gain attention from their followers by broadcasting posts to them. These broadcasters are likely to gain greater attention if their posts can remain visible for a longer period of time among their followers' most recent feeds. Then when to post? In this paper, we study the problem of smart broadcasting using the framework of temporal point processes, where we model users feeds and posts as discrete events occurring in continuous time. Based on such continuous-time model, then choosing a broadcasting strategy for a user becomes a problem of designing the conditional intensity of her posting events. We derive a novel formula which links this conditional intensity with the visibility of the user in her followers' feeds. Furthermore, by exploiting this formula, we develop an efficient convex optimization framework for the when-to-post problem. Our method can find broadcasting strategies that reach a desired visibility level with provable guarantees. We experimented with data gathered from Twitter, and show that our framework can consistently make broadcasters' post more visible than alternatives.",0
"This paper discusses a method for pipelining the calculation of CRC's, such as ITU/CCITT CRC32, into a mostly feed-forward architecture. This method allows several benefits such as independent scaling of circuit frequency and data throughput. Additionally it allows calculation over packet tails (packet length not a multiple of CRC input width). Finally it offers the ability to update a CRC where a subset of data in the packet has changed.",0
"External non-uniform magnetic fields acting on molecules induce non-collinear spin-densities and spin-symmetry breaking. This necessitates a general two-component Pauli spinor representation. In this paper, we report the implementation of a General Hartree-Fock method, without any spin constraints, for non-perturbative calculations with finite non-uniform fields. London atomic orbitals are used to ensure faster basis convergence as well as invariance under constant gauge shifts of the magnetic vector potential. The implementation has been applied to an investigate the joint orbital and spin response to a field gradient---quantified through the anapole moments---of a set of small molecules placed in a linearly varying magnetic field. The relative contributions of orbital and spin-Zeeman interaction terms have been studied both theoretically and computationally. Spin effects are stronger and show a general paramagnetic behaviour for closed shell molecules while orbital effects can have either direction. Basis set convergence and size effects of anapole susceptibility tensors have been reported. The relation of the mixed anapole susceptibility tensor to chirality is also demonstrated.",0
"In an earlier work [P. J. Bardroff and S. Stenholm], we have derived a fully quantum mechanical description of excess noise in strongly damped lasers. This theory is used here to derive the corresponding quantum Langevin equations. Taking the semi-classical limit of these we are able to regain the starting point of Siegman's treatment of excess noise [Phys. Rev. A 39, 1253 (1989)]. Our results essentially constitute a quantum derivation of his theory and allow some generalizations.",0

"We describe a thin-film superconducting Nb microwave resonator, tunable to within 0.3 ppm of the hyperfine splitting of $^{87}$Rb at $f_{Rb}=6.834683$ GHz. We coarsely tuned the resonator using electron-beam lithography, decreasing the resonance frequency from 6.8637 GHz to 6.8278 GHz. For \emph{in situ} fine tuning at 15 mK, the resonator inductance was varied using a piezoelectric stage to move a superconducting pin above the resonator. We found a maximum frequency shift of about 8.7 kHz per 60-nm piezoelectric step and a tuning range of 18 MHz.",0
We prove regularity results up to the boundary for time independent generalized Maxwell equations on Riemannian manifolds with boundary using the calculus of alternating differential forms. We discuss homogeneous and inhomogeneous boundary data and show 'polynomially weighted' regularity in exterior domains as well.,0
"In the study of smooth functions on manifolds, min-max theory provides a mechanism for identifying critical values of a function. In this paper we introduce a discretized version of this theory associated to a discrete Morse function on a (regular) cell complex.

"Lifetime values for alpha decay in even-even nuclei with $Z=84-98$ and $N=128-152$ have been calculated in the superasymmetric fission model. The interaction between the alpha particle and the daughter nucleus has been formed in the double folding approach using a density dependent NN interaction. The densities have been obtained using the Relativistic Mean Field formalism. The spectroscopic factors for the decays have been deduced and are shown to vary smoothly as a function of effective numbers of valence nucleons, $N_p$ and $N_n$ chosen with a suitable core. The implication of such a smooth behaviour has been discussed.",0
"We prove that the $L^1$-algebra of any non-Kac type compact quantum group does not satisfy operator biflatness. Since operator amenability implies operator biflatness, this result shows that any co-amenable, non-Kac type compact quantum group gives a counter example to the conjecture that $L^1(\Gb)$ is operator amenable if and only if $\Gb$ is amenable and co-amenable for any locally compact quantum group $\Gb$. The result also implies that the $L^1$-algebra of a locally compact quantum group is operator biprojective if and only if $\Gb$ is compact and of Kac type.",0
"Recently, the cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (CycleGAN) has been widely used for synthesis of multi-domain medical images. The domain-specific nonlinear deformations captured by CycleGAN make the synthesized images difficult to be used for some applications, for example, generating pseudo-CT for PET-MR attenuation correction. This paper presents a deformation-invariant CycleGAN (DicycleGAN) method using deformable convolutional layers and new cycle-consistency losses. Its robustness dealing with data that suffer from domain-specific nonlinear deformations has been evaluated through comparison experiments performed on a multi-sequence brain MR dataset and a multi-modality abdominal dataset. Our method has displayed its ability to generate synthesized data that is aligned with the source while maintaining a proper quality of signal compared to CycleGAN-generated data. The proposed model also obtained comparable performance with CycleGAN when data from the source and target domains are alignable through simple affine transformations.",0
"We present a multifractal analysis of Mount St. Helens seismic activity during 1980-2002. The seismic time distribution is studied in relation to the eruptive activity, mainly marked by the 1980 major explosive eruptions and by the 1980-1986 dome building eruptions. The spectrum of the generalized fractal dimensions, i.e. Dq vs q, extracted from the data, allows us to identify two main earthquake time-distribution patterns. The first one exhibits a multifractal clustering correlated to the intense seismic swarms of the dome building activity. The second one is characterized by an almost constant value of Dq 1, as for a random uniform distribution. The time evolution of Dq (for q=0,2) calculated on a fixed number of events window and at different depths, shows that the brittle mechanical response of the shallow layers to rapid magma intrusions, during the eruptive periods, is revealed by sharp changes, acting at a short time scale (order of days), and by the lowest values of Dq (0.3). Conversely, for deeper earthquakes, characterized by intense seismic swarms, Dq do not show obvious changes during the whole analyzed period, suggesting that the earthquakes, related to the deep magma supply system, are characterized by a minor degree of clustering, which is independent of the eruptive activity.",0
"With rapidly evolving technology, multicore and manycore processors have emerged as promising architectures to benefit from increasing transistor numbers. The transition towards these parallel architectures makes today an exciting time to investigate challenges in parallel computing. The TILEPro64 is a manycore accelerator, composed of 64 tiles interconnected via multiple 8x8 mesh networks. It contains per-tile caches and supports cache-coherent shared memory by default. In this paper we present a programming technique to take advantages of distributed caching facilities in manycore processors. However, unlike other work in this area, our approach does not use architecture-specific libraries. Instead, we provide the programmer with a novel technique on how to program future Non-Uniform Cache Architecture (NUCA) manycore systems, bearing in mind their caching organisation. We show that our localised programming approach can result in a significant improvement of the parallelisation efficiency (speed-up).",0
"Low temperature measurements of the magnetic susceptibility of LSCO suggest that the superconducting transition is associated with the disappearance of a vortex liquid. In this note we wish to draw attention to the fact that spin-orbit-like interactions in a poorly conducting layered material can lead to a new type of quantum ground state with spin polarized soliton-like charge carriers as the important quantum degree of freedom. In 2-dimensions these solitons are vortex-like, while in 3-dimensional systems they are monopole-like. In either case there is a natural mechanism for the pairing of spin up and spin down solitons, and we find that at low temperatures there is a cross-over transition as a function of carrier density between a state where the solitons are free and a condensate state where the spin up and spin down solitons in neighboring layers are paired.",0
"This is (mainly) a survey of recent results on the problem of the existence of infinitely many periodic orbits for Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms and Reeb flows. We focus on the Conley conjecture, proved for a broad class of closed symplectic manifolds, asserting that under some natural conditions on the manifold every Hamiltonian diffeomorphism has infinitely many (simple) periodic orbits. We discuss in detail the established cases of the conjecture and related results including an analog of the conjecture for Reeb flows, the cases where the conjecture is known to fail, the question of the generic existence of infinitely many periodic orbits, and local geometrical conditions that force the existence of infinitely many periodic orbits. We also show how a recently established variant of the Conley conjecture for Reeb flows can be applied to prove the existence of infinitely many periodic orbits of a low-energy charge in a non-vanishing magnetic field on a surface other than a sphere.",0
"The most promising way to increase the output power of an X-ray FEL (XFEL) is by tapering the magnetic field of the undulator. Also, significant increase in power is achievable by starting the FEL process from a monochromatic seed rather than from noise. This report proposes to make use of a cascade self-seeding scheme with wake monochromators in a tunable-gap baseline undulator at the European XFEL to create a source capable of delivering coherent radiation of unprecedented characteristics at hard X-ray wavelengths. Compared with SASE X-ray FEL parameters, the radiation from the new source has three truly unique aspects: complete longitudinal and transverse coherence, and a peak brightness three orders of magnitude higher than what is presently available at LCLS. Additionally, the new source will generate hard X-ray beam at extraordinary peak (TW) and average (kW) power level. The proposed source can thus revolutionize fields like single biomolecule imaging, inelastic scattering and nuclear resonant scattering. The self-seeding scheme with the wake monochromator is extremely compact, and takes almost no cost and time to be implemented. The upgrade proposed in this paper could take place during the commissioning stage of the European XFEL, opening a vast new range of applications from the very beginning of operations. We present feasibility study and examplifications for the SASE2 line of the European XFEL.",0
"Thermal-gravitational instability (TGI) is studied in the protogalactic environment. We extend our previous work, where we found that dense clumps first form out of hot background gas by thermal instability and later a small fraction of them grow to virialized clouds of mass M_c >~ 6X10^6 M_sun by gravitational infall and merging. But these clouds have large angular momentum, so they would be difficult, if not impossible, to further evolve into globular clusters. In this paper, through three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations in a uniformly rotating frame, we explore if the Coriolis force due to rotation in protogalactic disk regions can hinder binary merging and reduce angular momentum of the clouds formed. With rotation comparable to the Galactic rotation at the Solar circle, the Coriolis force is smaller than the pressure force during the early thermal instability stage. So the properties of clumps formed by thermal instability are not affected noticeably by rotation, except increased angular momentum. However, during later stage the Coriolis force becomes dominant over the gravity, and hence the further growth to gravitationally bound clouds by gravitational infall and merging is prohibited. Our results show that the Coriolis force effectively destroys the picture of cloud formation via TGI, rather than alleviate the problem of large angular momentum.",0
"We identify the key property that the exchange-correlation (XC) kernel of time-dependent density functional theory must have in order to describe long-range charge-transfer excitations. We show that the discontinuity of the XC potential as a function of particle number induces a space -and frequency-dependent discontinuity of the XC kernel which diverges as $r\to\infty$. In a combined donor-acceptor system, the same discontinuity compensates for the vanishing overlap between the acceptor and donor orbitals, thereby yielding a finite correction to the Kohn-Sham eigenvalue differences. This mechanism is illustrated to first order in the Coulomb interaction.",0
"It is important to understand the origin of molecular line intensities and chemical composition in the molecular-cloud scale in the Galactic sources because it serves as a benchmark to compare with the chemical compositions of extragalactic sources. Recent observations of the 3-mm spectra averaged over the 10-pc scale show similar spectral pattern among sources for molecular lines HCN, HCO$^+$, CCH, HNC, HNCO, c-C$_3$H$_2$, CS, SO, N$_2$H$^+$, and CN. To constrain the average physical property emitting such spectral pattern, we model molecular spectra using a time-dependent gas-grain chemical model followed by a radiative transfer calculation. We use a grid of physical parameters such as the density $n=3 \times 10^2 - 3\times 10^4$ cm$^{-3}$, the temperature, $T=10-30$ K, the visual extinction $A_{\rm V} = 2,4,10$ mag, the cosmic-ray ionization rate $\zeta = 10^{-17} - 10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$, and the sulfur elemental abundance $S/H = 8\times 10^{-8} - 8\times 10^{-7}$. Comparison with the observed spectra indicates that spectra are well reproduced with the relatively low density of $n=(1-3) \times 10^3\,$cm$^{-3}$, $T=10\,$K, $\zeta = 10^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$, and the short chemistry timescale of $10^5$ yrs. This short chemistry timescale may indicate that molecular clouds are constantly affected by the turbulence, and exposed to low-density, low $A_{\rm V}$ regions that """"refreshes"""" the chemical clock by UV radiation. The relatively low density obtained is orders of magnitude lower than the commonly-quoted critical density in the optically thin case. Meanwhile, this range of density is consistent with results from recent observational analysis of molecular-cloud-scale mapping.",0
"We provide a supersymmetric generalization of n quantum bits by extending the local operations and classical communication entanglement equivalence group [SU(2)]^n to the supergroup [uOSp(1|2)]^n and the stochastic local operations and classical communication equivalence group [SL(2,C)]^n to the supergroup [OSp(1|2)]^n. We introduce the appropriate supersymmetric generalizations of the conventional entanglement measures for the cases of $n=2$ and $n=3$. In particular, super-Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states are characterized by a nonvanishing superhyperdeterminant.",0
"We report through 17O NMR, an unambiguous local determination of the intrinsic kagome lattice spin susceptibility as well as that created around non-magnetic defects issued from natural Zn/ Cu exchange in the S=1/2 (Cu2+) herbertsmithite ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2 compound. The issue of a singlet-triplet gap is addressed. The magnetic response around a defect is found to markedly differ from that observed in non-frustrated antiferromagnetic materials. Finally, we discuss our relaxation measurements in the light of Cu and Cl NMR data [cond-mat 070314] and suggest a flat q-dependence of the excitations.",0
"In this paper we extend the notion of a locally hypercyclic operator to that of a locally hypercyclic tuple of operators. We then show that the class of hypercyclic tuples of operators forms a proper subclass to that of locally hypercyclic tuples of operators. What is rather remarkable is that in every finite dimensional vector space over $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$, a pair of commuting matrices exists which forms a locally hypercyclic, non-hypercyclic tuple. This comes in direct contrast to the case of hypercyclic tuples where the minimal number of matrices required for hypercyclicity is related to the dimension of the vector space. In this direction we prove that the minimal number of diagonal matrices required to form a hypercyclic tuple on $\mathbb{R}^n$ is $n+1$, thus complementing a recent result due to Feldman.",0
"The 2014 March 29 X1 solar flare (SOL20140329T17:48) produced bright continuum emission in the far- and near-ultraviolet (NUV) and highly asymmetric chromospheric emission lines, providing long-sought constraints on the heating mechanisms of the lower atmosphere in solar flares. We analyze the continuum and emission line data from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) of the brightest flaring magnetic footpoints in this flare. We compare the NUV spectra of the brightest pixels to new radiative-hydrodynamic predictions calculated with the RADYN code using constraints on a nonthermal electron beam inferred from the collisional thick-target modeling of hard X-ray data from RHESSI. We show that the atmospheric response to a high beam flux density satisfactorily achieves the observed continuum brightness in the NUV. The NUV continuum emission in this flare is consistent with hydrogen (Balmer) recombination radiation that originates from low optical depth in a dense chromospheric condensation and from the stationary beam-heated layers just below the condensation. A model producing two flaring regions (a condensation and stationary layers) in the lower atmosphere is also consistent with the asymmetric Fe II chromospheric emission line profiles observed in the impulsive phase.",0
"The unusual structural stability of gold nanowires at large separations of gold atoms is explained from first-principles quantum mechanical calculations. We show that undetected light atoms, in particular hydrogen, stabilize the experimentally observed structures, which would be unstable in pure gold wires. The enhanced cohesion is due to the partial charge transfer from gold to the light atoms. This finding should resolve a long-standing controversy between theoretical predictions and experimental observations.",0
"We present a general method of associating next-to-leading order weights to leading order phase space configurations at hadron colliders. The method relies on a re-organization of phase space for the real radiation contributions, defining a one-to-many map such that each point in the real phase space is associated with a distinct Born topology. As a result virtual and real singularities cancel at each Born phase space point. The new phase space maps can be used in a traditional approach for NLO calculations. However, interesting applications arise when one instead integrates out the real radiation up to a specified scale. This allows one to define NLO weights for individual phase space points that are present at LO. This method allows for the extension of matrix element methods to next-to-leading order, even in the presence of jets. We discuss some recent applications of the matrix element method to Higgs physics at the LHC.",0
"We study the temperature dependence as well as anisotropy of optical conductivity ($\sigma_1$) in the pseudocubic single crystal Pr$_{0.5}$Ca$_{1.5}$MnO$_{4}$ using spectrocopic ellipsometry. Three transition temperatures are observed and can be linked to charge-orbital ($T_{\rm CO/OO}$ $\sim$ 320 K), two-dimensional-antiferromagnetic (2D-AFM) ($\sim$ 200 K), and three-dimensional AFM ($T_{\rm N} \sim$ 125 K) orderings. Below $T_{\rm CO/OO}$, $\sigma_1$ shows a charge ordering peak ($\sim$0.8 eV) with a significant blue shift as the temperature decreases. Calculations based on a model that incorporates a static Jahn-Teller distortion and assumes the existence of a local charge imbalance between two different sublattices support this assignment and explain the blue shift. This view is further supported by the partial spectral weight analysis showing the onset of optical anisotropy at $T_{\rm CO/OO}$ in the charge-ordering region ($0.5-2.5$ eV). Interestingly, in the charge-transfer region ($2.5-4$ eV), the spectral weight shows anomalies around the $T_{\rm 2D-AFM}$ that we attribute to the role of oxygen-$p$ orbitals in stabilizing the CE-type magnetic ordering. Our result shows the importance of spin, charge, and lattice degrees of freedom in this layered manganite.",0
"We set up a correspondence between solutions of the Yang-Mills equations on ${\mathbb R}\times S^3$ and in Minkowski spacetime via de Sitter space. Some known Abelian and non-Abelian exact solutions are rederived. For the Maxwell case we present a straightforward algorithm to generate an infinite number of explicit solutions, with fields and potentials in Minkowski coordinates given by rational functions of increasing complexity. We illustrate our method with a nontrivial example.",0
"We present a novel approach to video summarisation that makes use of a Bag-of-visual-Textures (BoT) approach. Two systems are proposed, one based solely on the BoT approach and another which exploits both colour information and BoT features. On 50 short-term videos from the Open Video Project we show that our BoT and fusion systems both achieve state-of-the-art performance, obtaining an average F-measure of 0.83 and 0.86 respectively, a relative improvement of 9% and 13% when compared to the previous state-of-the-art. When applied to a new underwater surveillance dataset containing 33 long-term videos, the proposed system reduces the amount of footage by a factor of 27, with only minor degradation in the information content. This order of magnitude reduction in video data represents significant savings in terms of time and potential labour cost when manually reviewing such footage.",0
"This paper presents a finite difference quasi-Newton method for the minimization of noisy functions. The method takes advantage of the scalability and power of BFGS updating, and employs an adaptive procedure for choosing the differencing interval $h$ based on the noise estimation techniques of Hamming (2012) and Mor\'e and Wild (2011). This noise estimation procedure and the selection of $h$ are inexpensive but not always accurate, and to prevent failures the algorithm incorporates a recovery mechanism that takes appropriate action in the case when the line search procedure is unable to produce an acceptable point. A novel convergence analysis is presented that considers the effect of a noisy line search procedure. Numerical experiments comparing the method to a function interpolating trust region method are presented.",0
"In this paper we study the behavior of solutions of a nonlinear Schroedinger equation in presence of an external potential, which is allowed to be singular at one point. We show that the solution behaves like a solitary wave for long time even if we start from a unstable solitary wave, and its dynamics coincide with that of a classical particle evolving according to a natural effective Hamiltonian.",0
"Boolean network models have gained popularity in computational systems biology over the last dozen years. Many of these networks use canalizing Boolean functions, which has led to increased interest in the study of these functions. The canalizing depth of a function describes how many canalizing variables can be recursively picked off, until a non-canalizing function remains. In this paper, we show how every Boolean function has a unique algebraic form involving extended monomial layers and a well-defined core polynomial. This generalizes recent work on the algebraic structure of nested canalizing functions, and it yields a stratification of all Boolean functions by their canalizing depth. As a result, we obtain closed formulas for the number of n-variable Boolean functions with depth k, which simultaneously generalizes enumeration formulas for canalizing, and nested canalizing functions.",0
"We study aspects of obtaining field theories with noncommuting time-space coordinates as limits of open-string theories in constant electric-field backgrounds. We find that, within the standard closed-string backgrounds, there is an obstruction to decoupling the time-space noncommutativity scale from that of the string fuzziness scale. We speculate that this censorship may be string-theory's way of protecting the causality and unitarity structure. We study the moduli space of the obstruction in terms of the open- and closed-string backgrounds. Cases of both zero and infinite brane tensions as well as zero string couplings are obtained. A decoupling can be achieved formally by considering complex values of the dilaton and inverting the role of space and time in the light cone. This is reminiscent of a black-hole horizon. We study the corresponding supergravity solution in the large-N limit and find that the geometry has a naked singularity at the physical scale of noncommutativity.",0
"We study the question of the existence of infinitely many weak solutions for nonlocal equations of fractional Laplacian type with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary data, in presence of a superlinear term. Starting from the well-known Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz condition, we consider different growth assumptions on the nonlinearity, all of superlinear type. We obtain three different existence results in this setting by using the Fountain Theorem, which extend some classical results for semilinear Laplacian equations to the nonlocal fractional setting.",0
"An application of the equation proposed by the present authors, which is equivalent to the static field equation of the Faddeev model, is discussed. Under some assumptions on the space and on the form of the solution, the field equation is reduced to a non-linear ODE of second order. By solving this equation numerically, some solitonic solutions are obtained. It is discussed that the product of two integers specifying solutions may be identified with the Hopf topological invariant.",0
"We explain how fluctuations of ratios can constrain and falsify the statistical model of particle production in heavy ion collisions, using $K/\pi$ fluctuations as an example. We define an observable capable of determining which statistical model, if any, governs freeze-out in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. We calculate this observable for $K/\pi$ fluctuations, and show that it should be the same for RHIC and LHC energies, as well as independent of centrality, if the Grand-Canonical statistical model is an appropriate description and chemical equilibrium applies. We describe variations of this scaling for deviations from this scenario, such as light quark chemical non-equilibrium, strange quark over-saturation and local conservation (canonical ensemble) for strange quarks. We also introduce a similar observable capable, together with the published $K^*/K$ measurement, of ascertaining if an interacting hadron gas phase governs the system between thermal and chemical freeze-out, and of ascertaining its duration and impact on hadronic chemistry.",0
We classify the ideals of mixed products that are sequentially Cohen-Macaulay.,0
"Contrary to the Bohr complementarity principle, in 1995 Rabinowitz proposed that by using entangled particles from the source it would be possible to determine which slit a particle goes through while still preserving the interference pattern in the Young two slit experiment. In 2000, Kim et al used spontaneous parametric down conversion to prepare entangled photons as their source, and almost achieved this. In 2012, Menzel et al. experimentally succeeded in doing this. When the source emits entangled particle pairs, the traversed slit is inferred from measurement of the entangled particle location by using triangulation. The violation of complementarity breaches the prevailing probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics, and benefits the Bohm pilot wave theory.",0
"We discuss how to extract the pomeron-pomeron-$f_2(1270)$ ($\mathbb{P} \mathbb{P} f_2(1270)$) coupling within the tensor-pomeron model. The general $\mathbb{P} \mathbb{P} f_2(1270)$ coupling is a combination of seven basic couplings (tensorial structures). To study these tensorial structures we propose to measure the central-exclusive production of a $\pi^+ \pi^-$ pair in the invariant mass region of the $ f_2(1270)$. An analysis of angular distributions in the $\pi^+ \pi^-$ rest system, using the Collins-Soper (CS) frame, turns out to be particularly relevant for our purpose. Both, $\cos\theta_{\pi^{+},{\rm CS}}$ and $\phi_{\pi^{+},{\rm CS}}$ distributions are discussed. We find that the azimuthal angle distributions are quite sensitive to the choice of $\mathbb{P} \mathbb{P} f_2$ coupling. One of the $\mathbb{P} \mathbb{P} f_2$ couplings leads to four-oscillations in $\phi_{\pi^{+},{\rm CS}}$ compared to two-oscillations for the six other tensorial couplings. We show results for the resonance case alone as well as when the dipion continuum is included. We show the influence of the experimental cuts on the angular distributions in the context of dedicated experimental studies at RHIC and LHC energies. We discuss also how the absorption effects modify our results.",0
"Tactile displays have a wide potential field of applications, ranging from enhancing Virtual-Reality scenarios up to aiding telesurgery as well as in fundamental psychological and neurophysiological research. In this paper, we describe an open source hardware and software architecture that is designed to drive a variety of different tactile displays. For demonstration purposes, a tactile computer mouse featuring a simple tactile display, based on lateral piezoelectric (PZT) actuators, is presented. Even though we will focus on driving mechanical actuators in this paper, the system can be extended to different working principles. The suggested architecture is supplied with a custom, easy to use, software stack allowing a simple definition of tactile scenarios as well as user studies while being especially tailored to non-computer scientists. By releasing the OpenTactile system under MIT license we hope to ease the burden of controlling tactile displays as well as designing and reproducing the related experiments.",0
"Identifying the language of social media messages is an important first step in linguistic processing. Existing models for Twitter focus on content analysis, which is successful for dissimilar language pairs. We propose a label propagation approach that takes the social graph of tweet authors into account as well as content to better tease apart similar languages. This results in state-of-the-art shared task performance of $76.63\%$, $1.4\%$ higher than the top system.",0
"In this paper we study the existence and uniqueness of fixed points of a class of mappings defined on complete, (sequentially compact) cone metric spaces, without continuity conditions and depending on another function.",0
"We present a semiclassical perturbation method for the description of atomic diffraction by a weakly modulated potential. It proceeds in a way similar to the treatment of light diffraction by a thin phase grating, and consists in calculating the atomic wavefunction by means of action integrals along the classical trajectories of the atoms in the absence of the modulated part of the potential. The capabilities and the validity condition of the method are illustrated on the well-known case of atomic diffraction by a Gaussian standing wave. We prove that in this situation the perturbation method is equivalent to the Raman-Nath approximation, and we point out that the usually-considered Raman-Nath validity condition can lead to inaccuracies in the evaluation of the phases of the diffraction amplitudes. The method is also applied to the case of an evanescent wave reflection grating, and an analytical expression for the diffraction pattern at any incidence angle is obtained for the first time. Finally, the application of the method to other situations is briefly discussed.",0
"Widths of the rapidity distributions of various identified hadrons generated with the UrQMD-3.4 event generator at all the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) energies have been presented and compared with the existing experimental results. An increase in the width of the rapidity distribution of $\Lambda$ could be seen with both Monte Carlo (MC) and experimental data for the studied energies. Using MC data, the study has been extended to Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energies. A similar jump, as observed in the plot of rapidity width versus rest mass at Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) and all SPS energies, persists even at RHIC and LHC energies, confirming its universal nature from AGS to the highest LHC energies. Such observation indicates that pair production may not be the only mechanism of particle production at the highest LHC energies. However, with MC data, the separate mass scaling for mesons and baryons is found to exist even at the top LHC energy.",0
"Recent work in graph models has found that probabilistic hyperedge replacement grammars (HRGs) can be extracted from graphs and used to generate new random graphs with graph properties and substructures close to the original. In this paper, we show how to add latent variables to the model, trained using Expectation-Maximization, to generate still better graphs, that is, ones that generalize better to the test data. We evaluate the new method by separating training and test graphs, building the model on the former and measuring the likelihood of the latter, as a more stringent test of how well the model can generalize to new graphs. On this metric, we find that our latent-variable HRGs consistently outperform several existing graph models and provide interesting insights into the building blocks of real world networks.",0
"We discuss how chiral fermions can appear in the type IIB matrix model, which is considered to be a nonperturbative formulation of superstring theory. In particular, we are concerned with a constructive definition of the theory, in which we start with a finite-N configuration and take the large-N limit later on. We point out that there exists a certain necessary condition which the structure of the extra dimensions should satisfy. As an example, we consider a previous proposal using intersecting branes and show that chiral fermions can indeed be realized in four dimensions by introducing a matrix counterpart of warped space-time. This is remarkable in view of the well-known difficulty in realizing chiral fermions in lattice gauge theory.",0
"It was recently shown that velocity-dependent forces between parallel fundamental strings moving apart in a $D-$dimensional spacetime implied an accelerating expanding universe in $D-1$-dimensional space-time. Exact solutions were obtained for the early time expansion in $D=5,6$. Here we show that this result also holds for fundamental strings in the background of a fivebrane, and argue that the feature of an accelerating universe would hold for more general $p$-brane-seeded models.",0
"We have investigated spin Hall effects in 4$d$ and 5$d$ transition metals, Nb, Ta, Mo, Pd and Pt, by incorporating the spin absorption method in the lateral spin valve structure; where large spin current preferably relaxes into the transition metals, exhibiting strong spin-orbit interactions. Thereby nonlocal spin valve measurements enable us to evaluate their spin Hall conductivities. The sign of the spin Hall conductivity changes systematically depending on the number of $d$ electrons. This tendency is in good agreement with the recent theoretical calculation based on the intrinsic spin Hall effect.",0
"One-sample and multi-sample tests on the concentration parameter of Fisher-von Mises-Langevin (FvML) distributions have been well studied in the literature. However, only very little is known about their behavior under local alternatives, which is due to complications inherent to the curved nature of the parameter space. The aim of the present paper therefore consists in filling that gap by having recourse to the Le Cam methodology, which has been adapted from the linear to the spherical setup in Ley \emph{et al.} (2013). We obtain explicit expressions of the powers for the most efficient one- and multi-sample tests; these tests are those considered in Watamori and Jupp (2005). As a nice by-product, we are also able to write down the powers (against local FvML alternatives) of the celebrated Rayleigh (1919) test of uniformity. A Monte Carlo simulation study confirms our theoretical findings and shows the finite-sample behavior of the above-mentioned procedures.",0
"Accessing hadronic form factors at large momentum transfers has traditionally presented a challenge for lattice QCD simulations. Here we demonstrate how a novel implementation of the Feynman-Hellmann method can be employed to calculate hadronic form factors in lattice QCD at momenta much higher than previously accessible. Our simulations are performed on a single set of gauge configurations with three flavours of degenerate mass quarks corresponding to $m_\pi \approx 470 \text{ MeV}$. We are able to determine the electromagnetic form factors of the pion and nucleon up to approximately $6 \text{ GeV}^2$, with results for $G_E/G_M$ in the proton agreeing well with experimental results.",0
"We propose a phantom crossing Dvali--Gabadadze--Porrati (DGP) model. In our model, the effective equation of state of the DGP gravity crosses the phantom divide line. We demonstrate crossing of the phantom divide does not occur within the framework of the original DGP model or the DGP model developed by Dvali and Turner. By extending their model, we construct a model that realizes crossing of the phantom divide. DGP models can account for late-time acceleration of the universe without dark energy. Phantom Crossing DGP model is more compatible with recent observational data from Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa), Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) than the original DGP model or the DGP model developed by Dvali and Turner.",0
"We study $G$-vertex-primitive and $(G,s)$-arc-transitive digraphs for almost simple groups $G$ with socle $\mathrm{PSL}_n(q)$. It turns out that $s\leqslant2$ for such digraphs, which provides the first step in determining an upper bound on $s$ for all the vertex-primitive $s$-arc-transitive digraphs.",0
"In this note we establish the explicit relation between correlation functions in ${\cal N} = 4$ SUSY Yang--Mills theory on $S^3\times R$ in a double scaling limit and scattering amplitudes of the String Theory on the pp-wave background. The relation is found for two-- and three--point correlation functions in these theories. As a by product we formulate a dictionary for the correspondence between these theories: in particular, we find some unknown relations between the parameters in these theories. Furthermore, we argue that the String Theory on the pp--wave background is related to four--dimensional SUSY Yang--Mills theory rather than to the reduced matrix quantum mechanics. We identify string theory excitations which are related to the Kaluza--Klein excitation of the Yang--Mills theory on $S^3$.",0
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations allow the exploration of the phase space of biopolymers through the integration of equations of motion of their constituent atoms. The analysis of MD trajectories often relies on the choice of collective variables (CVs) along which the dynamics of the system is projected. We developed a graphical user interface (GUI) for facilitating the interactive choice of the appropriate CVs. The GUI allows: defining interactively new CVs; partitioning the configurations into microstates characterized by similar values of the CVs; calculating the free energies of the microstates for both unbiased and biased (metadynamics) simulations; clustering the microstates in kinetic basins; visualizing the free energy landscape as a function of a subset of the CVs used for the analysis. A simple mouse click allows one to quickly inspect structures corresponding to specific points in the landscape.,0
"The essence of special relativity is hiding in the equal existence of particle and antiparticle, which can be expressed by two discrete symmetries within one inertial frame --- the invariance under the (newly defined) space-time inversion (${\bf x}\to -{\bf x},t\to -t$), or equivalently, the invariance under a mass inversion ($m\to -m$). The problems discussed are: the evolution of the $CPT$ invariance into a basic postulate, an unique solution to the original puzzle in Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox, the reduced Dirac equation for hydrogenlike atoms, and the negative mass paradox leading to the prediction of antigravity between matter and antimatter. {\bf Keywords}: Special relativity, Reduced Dirac Equation, Antiparticle, Antigravity",0
"Introduced by Kraitchik and Lehmer, an $x$-pseudosquare is a positive integer $n\equiv1\pmod 8$ that is a quadratic residue for each odd prime $p\le x$, yet is not a square. We use bounds of character sums to prove that pseudosquares are equidistributed in fairly short intervals. An $x$-pseudopower to base $g$ is a positive integer which is not a power of $g$ yet is so modulo $p$ for all primes $p\le x$. It is conjectured by Bach, Lukes, Shallit, and Williams that the least such number is at most $\exp(a_g x/\log x)$ for a suitable constant $a_g$. A bound of $\exp(a_g x\log\log x/\log x)$ is proved conditionally on the Riemann Hypothesis for Dedekind zeta functions, thus improving on a recent conditional exponential bound of Konyagin and the present authors. We also give a GRH-conditional equidistribution result for pseudopowers that is analogous to our unconditional result for pseudosquares.",0
We report recent results on $\phi_3$ measurement at the Belle collaboration. The analyses reported here are based on a large data sample that contains 657 million $B\bar{B}$ pairs collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy $e^+ e^-$ collider at the $\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance.,0
"The subject of the present paper is an application of quantum probability to $p$-adic objects. We give a quantum-probabilistic interpretation of the spherical Hecke algebra for ${\rm PGL}_2(F)$, where $F$ is a $p$-adic field. As a byproduct, we obtain a new proof of the Fourier inversion formula for ${\rm PGL}_2(F)$.",0
This is a reminder that an infinite series can be defined other than as the limit of a sequence of finite series. An example is provided in which a circuit element comprised of an infinite series of resistors has negative resistance.,0
"In the light of the recent result from KamLAND-Zen (KLZ) and GERDA Phase-II, we update the bounds on the effective mass and the new physics parameters, relevant for neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu \beta \beta$). In addition to the light Majorana neutrino exchange, we analyze beyond standard model contributions that arise in Left-Right symmetry and R-Parity violating supersymmetry. The improved limit from KLZ constrains the effective mass of light neutrino exchange down to sub-eV mass regime 0.06 eV. Using the correlation between the $^{136}\rm{Xe}$ and $^{76}\rm{Ge}$ half-lives, we show that the KLZ limit individually rules out the positive claim of observation of $0\nu\beta\beta$ for all nuclear matrix element compilation. For the Left-Right symmetry and R-parity violating supersymmetry, the KLZ bound implies a factor of 2 improvement of the effective mass and the new physics parameters. The future ton scale experiments such as, nEXO will further constrain these models, in particular, will rule out standard as well as Type-II dominating LRSM inverted hierarchy scenario.",0
"We present a measurement of the angular power spectrum of the cosmic far-infrared background (CFIRB) anisotropies in one of the extragalactic fields of the Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS) at 250, 350 and 500 \mu m bands. Consistent with recent measurements of the CFIRB power spectrum in Herschel-SPIRE maps, we confirm the existence of a clear one-halo term of galaxy clustering on arcminute angular scales with large-scale two-halo term of clustering at 30 arcminutes to angular scales of a few degrees. The power spectrum at the largest angular scales, especially at 250 \mu m, is contaminated by the Galactic cirrus. The angular power spectrum is modeled using a conditional luminosity function approach to describe the spatial distribution of unresolved galaxies that make up the bulk of the CFIRB. Integrating over the dusty galaxy population responsible for the background anisotropies, we find that the cosmic abundance of dust, relative to the critical density, to be between \Omega_dust=10^{-6} and 8 x 10^{-6} in the redshift range z ~ 0-3. This dust abundance is consistent with estimates of the dust content in the Universe using quasar reddening and magnification measurements in the SDSS.",0
"A well known theorem by Alexander-Hirschowitz states that all the higher secant varieties of $V_{n,d}$ (the $d$-uple embedding of $\mathbb{P}^n$) have the expected dimension, with few known exceptions. We study here the same problem for $T_{n,d}$, the tangential variety to $V_{n,d}$, and prove a conjecture, which is the analogous of Alexander-Hirschowitz theorem, for $n\leq 9$. Moreover. we prove that it holds for any $n,d$ if it holds for $d=3$. Then we generalize to the case of $O_{k,n,d}$, the $k$-osculating variety to $V_{n,d}$, proving, for $n=2$, a conjecture that relates the defectivity of $\sigma_s(O_{k,n,d})$ to the Hilbert function of certain sets of fat points in $\mathbb{P}^n$.",0
"A theoretical analysis of solutions of renormalisation group equations in the MSSM corresponding to the quasi-fixed point conditions shows that the mass of the lightest Higgs boson in this case does not exceed $94\pm 5\text{GeV}$. It means that a substantial part of the parameter space of the MSSM is practically excluded by existing experimental data from LEP II. In the NMSSM the upper bound on the lightest Higgs boson mass reaches its maximum in the strong Yukawa coupling regime, when Yukawa constants are considerably larger the gauge ones on the Grand Unification scale. In this paper a particle spectrum in a simple modification of NMSSM which leads to a self-consistent solution in the considered region of the parameter space is studied. This model allows one to get $m_h\sim 125\text{GeV}$ even for comparatively low values of $\tan\beta\ge 1.9$. For an analysis of the Higgs boson spectrum and neutralino spectrum a method for diagonalisation of mass matrices proposed formerly is used. The mass of the lightest Higgs boson in this model does not exceed $130.5\pm 3.5\text{GeV}$.",0
"We use a cluster sample selected independently of the intracluster medium content with reliable masses to measure the mean gas mass fraction and its scatter, the biases of the X-ray selection on gas mass fraction, and the covariance between the X-ray luminosity and gas mass. The sample is formed by 34 galaxy clusters in the nearby ($0.050<z<0.135$) Universe, mostly with $14<\log M_{500}/M_\odot \lesssim 14.5$, and with masses calculated with the caustic technique. First, we found that integrated gas density profiles have similar shapes, extending earlier results based on subpopulations of clusters such as those that are relaxed or X-ray bright for their mass. Second, the X-ray unbiased selection of our sample allows us to unveil a variegate population of clusters; the gas mass fraction shows a scatter of $0.17\pm0.04$ dex, possibly indicating a quite variable amount of feedback from cluster to cluster, which is larger than is found in previous samples targeting subpopulations of galaxy clusters, such as relaxed or X-ray bright clusters. The similarity of the gas density profiles induces an almost scatterless relation between X-ray luminosity, gas mass, and halo mass, and modulates selection effects in the halo gas mass fraction: gas-rich clusters are preferentially included in X-ray selected samples. The almost scatterless relation also fixes the relative scatters and slopes of the $L_X-M$ and $M_{gas}-M$ relations and makes core-excised X-ray luminosities and gas masses fully covariant. Therefore, cosmological or astrophysical studies involving X-ray or SZ selected samples need to account for both selection effects and covariance of the studied quantities with X-ray luminosity/SZ strength.",0
"A weak Galerkin discretization of the boundary value problem of a general anisotropic diffusion problem is studied for preservation of the maximum principle. It is shown that the direct application of the $M$-matrix theory to the stiffness matrix of the weak Galerkin discretization leads to a strong mesh condition requiring all of the mesh dihedral angles to be strictly acute (a constant-order away from 90 degrees). To avoid this difficulty, a reduced system is considered and shown to satisfy the discrete maximum principle under weaker mesh conditions. The discrete maximum principle is then established for the full weak Galerkin approximation using the relations between the degrees of freedom located on elements and edges. Sufficient mesh conditions for both piecewise constant and general anisotropic diffusion matrices are obtained. These conditions provide a guideline for practical mesh generation for preservation of the maximum principle. Numerical examples are presented.",0
"Memory-safety violations are a prevalent cause of both reliability and security vulnerabilities in systems software written in unsafe languages like C/C++. Unfortunately, all the existing software-based solutions to this problem exhibit high performance overheads preventing them from wide adoption in production runs. To address this issue, Intel recently released a new ISA extension - Memory Protection Extensions (Intel MPX), a hardware-assisted full-stack solution to protect against memory safety violations. In this work, we perform an exhaustive study of the Intel MPX architecture to understand its advantages and caveats. We base our study along three dimensions: (a) performance overheads, (b) security guarantees, and (c) usability issues. To put our results in perspective, we compare Intel MPX with three prominent software-based approaches: (1) trip-wire - AddressSanitizer, (2) object-based - SAFECode, and (3) pointer-based - SoftBound. Our main conclusion is that Intel MPX is a promising technique that is not yet practical for widespread adoption. Intel MPX's performance overheads are still high (roughly 50% on average), and the supporting infrastructure has bugs which may cause compilation or runtime errors. Moreover, we showcase the design limitations of Intel MPX: it cannot detect temporal errors, may have false positives and false negatives in multithreaded code, and its restrictions on memory layout require substantial code changes for some programs.",0
"The Residual Quantization (RQ) framework is revisited where the quantization distortion is being successively reduced in multi-layers. Inspired by the reverse-water-filling paradigm in rate-distortion theory, an efficient regularization on the variances of the codewords is introduced which allows to extend the RQ for very large numbers of layers and also for high dimensional data, without getting over-trained. The proposed Regularized Residual Quantization (RRQ) results in multi-layer dictionaries which are additionally sparse, thanks to the soft-thresholding nature of the regularization when applied to variance-decaying data which can arise from de-correlating transformations applied to correlated data. Furthermore, we also propose a general-purpose pre-processing for natural images which makes them suitable for such quantization. The RRQ framework is first tested on synthetic variance-decaying data to show its efficiency in quantization of high-dimensional data. Next, we use the RRQ in super-resolution of a database of facial images where it is shown that low-resolution facial images from the test set quantized with codebooks trained on high-resolution images from the training set show relevant high-frequency content when reconstructed with those codebooks.",0
"Recently there has been a dramatic increase in the performance of recognition systems due to the introduction of deep architectures for representation learning and classification. However, the mathematical reasons for this success remain elusive.

"We report spectroscopic observations of HD 27638B, the secondary in a visual binary in which the physically associated primary (separation approximately 19 arcsec) is a B9V star. The secondary shows strong Li 6708 absorption suggesting youth, and has attracted attention in the past as a candidate post-T Tauri star although this has subsequently been ruled out. It was previously known to be a double-lined spectroscopic binary (F8+G6) with a period of 17.6 days, and to show velocity residuals indicating a more distant massive third companion with a period of at least 8 years. Based on our radial velocity measurements covering more than two cycles of the outer orbit, along with other measurements, we derive an accurate triple orbital solution giving an outer period of 9.447 +/- 0.017 yr. The third object is more massive than either of the other two components of HD 27638B, but is not apparent in the spectra. We derive absolute visual magnitudes and effective temperatures for the three visible stars in HD 27638. Isochrone fitting based on those properties gives an age of 200 +/- 50 Myr for the system. We infer also an inclination angle of about 53.3 degrees for the inner orbit of HD 27638B. We detect a near-infrared excess in HD 27638B which we attribute to the third star being a close binary composed of late-type stars. This explains its large mass and lack of a visible signature. Modeling of this excess allows us to infer not only the masses of the components of the unseen companion, but also the inclination angle of the outer orbit (approximately 73 deg). The HD 27638 system is thus at least quintuple.",0
"A previously unknown effect-giant spatial redistribution of the electric field strength in a crystal under illumination of the structure - was discovered and investigated in real photoresistors on high-resistivity (semi-insulating) semiconductor CdTe crystals (in metal-thin insulator- semiconductor-thin insulator -metal structures). A new concept is proposed for photoelectric phenomena in high- resistivity semiconductor crystals. The concept is based on the idea that the redistribution of the field under such conditions that the carrier lifetime remains unchanged under illumination plays a determining role in these phenomena. The nature of the effect is described, the dependence of the characteristics of the structures on the parameters of the crystal and the insulator layers is explained by the manifestation of this effect, and ways to produce structures with prescribed photoelectric characteristics for new devices and scientific methods are examined.",0
"The long wavelength emission of protostellar objects is commonly attributed to a disk of gas and dust around the central protostar. In the first stages of disk accretion or in the case of high mass protostars, the disk mass is likely to be sufficiently large, so that the disk self-gravity may have an impact on the dynamics and the emission properties of the disk. In this paper we describe the spectral energy distribution (SED) produced by a simple, non-flaring, self-gravitating accretion disk model. Self-gravity is included in the calculation of the rotation curve of the disk and in the energy balance equation, as a term of effective heating related to Jeans instability. In order to quantify in detail the requirements on the mass of the disk and on the accretion rate posed on the models by realistic situations, we compare the SEDs produced by these models with the observed SEDs of a small sample of well-studied protostellar objects. We find that relatively modest disks - even lighter than the central star - can lead to an interesting fit to the infrared SED of the FU Orionis objects considered, while in the case of T Tauri stars the required parameters fall outside the range suggested as acceptable by the general theoretical and observational scenario. On the basis of the present results, we may conclude that the contribution of a self-gravitating disk is plausible in several cases (in particular, for FU Orionis objects) and that, in the standard irradiation dominated disk scenario, it would help softening the requirements encountered by Keplerian accretion models.",0
"We explore Random Scale-Free networks of populations, modelled by chaotic Ricker maps, connected by transport that is triggered when population density in a patch is in excess of a critical threshold level. Our central result is that threshold-activated dispersal leads to stable fixed populations, for a wide range of threshold levels. Further, suppression of chaos is facilitated when the threshold-activated migration is more rapid than the intrinsic population dynamics of a patch. Additionally, networks with large number of nodes open to the environment, readily yield stable steady states. Lastly we demonstrate that in networks with very few open nodes, the degree and betweeness centrality of the node open to the environment has a pronounced influence on control. All qualitative trends are corroborated by quantitative measures, reflecting the efficiency of control, and the width of the steady state window.",0
"In this paper a new approach for recognition of Persian phonemes on the PCVC speech dataset is proposed. Nowadays deep neural networks are playing main rule in classification tasks. However the best results in speech recognition are not as good as human recognition rate yet. Deep learning techniques are shown their outstanding performance over so many classification tasks like image classification, document classification, etc. Also in some tasks their performance were even better than human. So the reason why ASR (automatic speech recognition) systems are not as good as the human speech recognition system is mostly depend on features of data is fed to deep neural networks. In this research first sound samples are cut for exact extraction of phoneme sounds in 50ms samples. Then phonemes are grouped in 30 groups; Containing 23 consonants, 6 vowels and a silence phoneme. STFT (Short time Fourier transform) is applied on them and Then STFT results are given to PPNet (A new deep convolutional neural network architecture) classifier and a total average of 75.87% accuracy is reached which is the best result ever compared to other algorithms on Separated Persian phonemes (Like in PCVC speech dataset).",0
"In order to attain the requisite sensitivity for LISA, laser frequency noise must be suppressed below the secondary noises such as the optical path noise, acceleration noise etc. In a previous paper (Dhurandhar et al., Class. Quantum Grav., 27, 135013, 2010), we have found a large family of second-generation analytic solutions of time delay interferometry with one arm dysfunctional, and we also estimated the laser noise due to residual time-delay semi-analytically from orbit perturbations due to Earth. Since other planets and solar-system bodies also perturb the orbits of LISA spacecraft and affect the time delay interferometry (TDI), we simulate the time delay numerically in this paper for all solutions with the generation number n \leq 3. We have worked out a set of 3-year optimized mission orbits of LISA spacecraft starting at January 1, 2021 using the CGC2.7 ephemeris framework. We then use this numerical solution to calculate the residual optical path differences in the second-generation solutions of our previous paper, and compare with the semi-analytic error estimate. The accuracy of this calculation is better than 1 cm (or 30 ps). The maximum path length difference, for all configuration calculated, is below 1 m (3 ns). This is well below the limit under which the laser frequency noise is required to be suppressed. The numerical simulation in this paper can be applied to other space-borne interferometers for gravitational wave detection with the simplification of having only one interferometer.",0
"The study of cellular signalling pathways and their deregulation in disease states, such as cancer, is a large and extremely complex task. Indeed, these systems involve many parts and processes but are studied piecewise and their literatures and data are consequently fragmented, distributed and sometimes--at least apparently--inconsistent. This makes it extremely difficult to build significant explanatory models with the result that effects in these systems that are brought about by many interacting factors are poorly understood. The rule-based approach to modelling has shown some promise for the representation of the highly combinatorial systems typically found in signalling where many of the proteins are composed of multiple binding domains, capable of simultaneous interactions, and/or peptide motifs controlled by post-translational modifications. However, the rule-based approach requires highly detailed information about the precise conditions for each and every interaction which is rarely available from any one single source. Rather, these conditions must be painstakingly inferred and curated, by hand, from information contained in many papers--each of which contains only part of the story. In this paper, we introduce a graph-based meta-model, attuned to the representation of cellular signalling networks, which aims to ease this massive cognitive burden on the rule-based curation process. This meta-model is a generalization of that used by Kappa and BNGL which allows for the flexible representation of knowledge at various levels of granularity. In particular, it allows us to deal with information which has either too little, or too much, detail with respect to the strict rule-based meta-model. Our approach provides a basis for the gradual aggregation of fragmented biological knowledge extracted from the literature into an instance of the meta-model from which we can define an automated translation into executable Kappa programs.",0

"We study the scaling limits of looptrees associated with Bienaym\'e--Galton--Watson (BGW) trees, that are obtained by replacing every vertex of the tree by a """"cycle"""" whose size is its degree. First, we consider BGW trees whose offspring distribution is critical and in the domain of attraction of a Gaussian distribution. We prove that the Brownian CRT is the scaling limit of the associated looptrees, thereby confirming a prediction of [CK14b]. Then, we deal with BGW trees whose offspring distribution is critical and heavy-tailed. We show that the scaling limit of the associated looptrees is a multiple of the unit circle. This corresponds to a so-called condensation phenomenon, meaning that the underlying tree exhibits a vertex with macroscopic degree. Here, we rely on an invariance principle for random walks with negative drift, which is of independent interest. Finally, we apply these results to the study of the scaling limits of large faces of Boltzmann planar maps. We complete the results of [Ric17] and establish a phase transition for the topology of these maps in the non-generic critical regime.",0
"We show that globally defined quasiconformal mappings of rigid Carnot groups are affine, but that globally defined contact mappings of rigid Carnot groups need not be quasiconformal, and a fortiori not affine.",0
"I calculate the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of accreting circumplanetary disks using atmospheric radiative transfer models. Circumplanetary disks only accreting at $10^{-10} M_{\odot} yr^{-1}$ around a 1 M$_{J}$ planet can be brighter than the planet itself. A moderately accreting circumplanetary disk ($\dot{M}\sim 10^{-8}M_{\odot} yr^{-1}$; enough to form a 10 M$_{J}$ planet within 1 Myr) around a 1 M$_{J}$ planet has a maximum temperature of $\sim$2000 K, and at near-infrared wavelengths ($J$, $H$, $K$ bands), this disk is as bright as a late M-type brown dwarf or a 10 M$_{J}$ planet with a """"hot start"""". To use direct imaging to find the accretion disks around low mass planets (e.g., 1 M$_{J}$) and distinguish them from brown dwarfs or hot high mass planets, it is crucial to obtain photometry at mid-infrared bands ($L'$, $M$, $N$ bands) because the emission from circumplanetary disks falls off more slowly towards longer wavelengths than those of brown dwarfs or planets. If young planets have strong magnetic fields ($\gtrsim$100 G), fields may truncate slowly accreting circumplanetary disks ($\dot{M}\lesssim10^{-9} M_{\odot} yr^{-1}$) and lead to magnetospheric accretion, which can provide additional accretion signatures, such as UV/optical excess from the accretion shock and line emission.",0
"Recent work has shown that additive threat models, which only permit the addition of bounded noise to the pixels of an image, are insufficient for fully capturing the space of imperceivable adversarial examples. For example, small rotations and spatial transformations can fool classifiers, remain imperceivable to humans, but have large additive distance from the original images. In this work, we leverage quantitative perceptual metrics like LPIPS and SSIM to define a novel threat model for adversarial attacks. To demonstrate the value of quantifying the perceptual distortion of adversarial examples, we present and employ a unifying framework fusing different attack styles. We first prove that our framework results in images that are unattainable by attack styles in isolation. We then perform adversarial training using attacks generated by our framework to demonstrate that networks are only robust to classes of adversarial perturbations they have been trained against, and combination attacks are stronger than any of their individual components. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that our combined attacks retain the same perceptual distortion but induce far higher misclassification rates when compared against individual attacks.",0
"Scalar \cite{scalar_paper} and tensor \cite{tensor_paper} glueballs created in $J/\psi$ radiative decays are studied in quenched lattice QCD. Using two anisotropic lattices to approach the continuum limit, we compute the relevant form factors responsible for the decay rates for $J/\psi\rightarrow\gamma G_{0^{++}}$ and $J/\psi\rightarrow\gamma G_{2^{++}}$. Comparing with the existing experimental data, it is argued that $f_0(1710)$ is a favorable candidate for scalar glueball. The decay rate for $J/\psi\rightarrow\gamma G_{2^{++}}$ is found to be quite substantial. A comprehensive search in the tensor channel on BESIII is therefore suggested.",0
The fields in rectangular and circular waveguides are derived from Maxwell's equations by superposition of plane waves. Subsequently the results are applied to explain cavity modes. Interaction of the cavity modes with a charged particle beam leads to the fundamental parameters used to describe the performance of accelerating cavities. Finally an introduction to multi-gap cavities is given by the example of travelling-wave structures.,0
"(abridged) We have analyzed the properties of the Na D doublet lines in a large sample of 691 radio galaxies using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). These radio galaxies are resolved in the FIRST survey, have redshifts less that 0.2 and radio flux densities at 1.4 GHz higher than 40 mJy. Approximately 1/3 of the sources show a significant excess (above that contributed by their stellar populations) of Na D absorption that can be robustly fitted with two Voigt profiles representing the Na D doublet. A further 1/6 of the sources show residual absorption, for which the fits were not well constrained though while ~50% of the sample show no significant residual absorption. The residual absorption is modestly blueshifted, typically by ~50 km/s, but the velocity dispersions are high, generally ~500 km/s. Assuming that the size of the absorbing region is consistent with ~1 kpc for dust lanes in a sample of generally more powerful radio sources and a continuous constant velocity flow (continuity equation), we estimate mass and energy outflow rates of about 10 Msun/yr and few x e42 erg/s. These rates are consistent with those in the literature based on HI absorption line observations of radio galaxies. The energy required to power these outflows is on the order of 1-10% of the jet mechanical power and we conclude that the radio jet alone is sufficient. The mass and energy outflow rates are consistent with what is needed to heat/expel the mass returned by the stellar populations as well as the likely amount of gas from a cooling halo. This suggests that radio-loud AGN play a key role in energizing the outflow/heating phase of the feedback cycle. The deposition of the jet mechanical energy could be important for explaining the ensemble characteristics of massive early type galaxies in the local universe.",0
"We only see a small fraction of the matter in the universe, but the rest gives itself away by the impact of its gravity. Peculiar velocities have the potential to be a powerful tool to trace this matter however previous peculiar velocity surveys have struggled to meet their potential because of the large errors on individual measurements, poor statistics and uneven sky coverage. The 2MASS Tully-Fisher (2MTF) survey will make use of existing high quality rotations widths, new HI widths and 2MASS (2 Micron All-Sky Survey) photometry to measure Tully-Fisher distances/peculiar velocities for all bright inclined spirals in the 2MASS redshift survey (2MRS). This survey based on the 2MASS galaxy catalog will provide a qualitatively better sample. It will provide significant improvements in sky coverage especially near the plane of our Galaxy which crosses the poorly understood """"great attractor"""" region. I will give a progress report on the 2MTF survey including a look at over 300 hours of HI observations from the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) and a report on ongoing southern hemisphere observations with the Parke s Radio Telescope. The new spiral I-band field (SFI++) sample is currently the best available peculiar velocity survey for use in the local universe. I will also report on some preliminary results from this sample.",0
"We propose an experimental scheme to realize the valley-dependent gauge fields for ultracold fermionic atoms trapped in a state-dependent square optical lattice. Our scheme relies on two sets of Raman laser beams to engineer the hopping between adjacent sites populated by two-component fermionic atoms. One set of Raman beams are used to realize a staggered \pi-flux lattice, where low energy atoms near two inequivalent Dirac points should be described by the Dirac equation for spin-1/2 particles. Another set of laser beams with proper Rabi frequencies are added to further modulate the atomic hopping parameters. The hopping modulation will give rise to effective gauge potentials with opposite signs near the two valleys, mimicking the interesting strain-induced pseudo-gauge fields in graphene. The proposed valley-dependent gauge fields are tunable and provide a new route to realize quantum valley Hall effects and atomic valleytronics.",0
"By incorporating the flavor-dependent quark-antiquark annihilation amplitude into the mass-squared matrix describing the mixing of the isoscalar states of a meson nonet, the new version of Schwinger's nonet mass formula which holds with a high accuracy for the $0^{-+}$, $1^{--}$, $2^{++}$, $2^{-+}$ and $3^{--}$ nonets is derived and the mixing angle of isoscalar octet-singlet for these nonets is obtained. In particular, the mixing angle of isoscalar octet-singlet for pseudoscalar nonet is determined to take the value of $-12.92^\circ$, which is in agreement with the value of $-13^\circ\sim-17^\circ$ deduced from a rather exhaustive and up-to-date analysis of data. It is also pointed out that the omission of the flavor-dependent $q\bar{q}$ annihilation effect might be a factor resulting in the invalidity of Schwinger's original nonet mass formula for pseudoscalar nonet.",0
"The interplay between groups and graphs have been the most famous and productive area of algebraic graph theory.

"Inspired by recent suggestions that the Alzheimer's amyloid beta peptide (A beta) can insert into cell membranes and form harmful ion channels, we model insertion of the 40 and 42 residue forms of the peptide into cell membranes using a Monte Carlo code which is specific at the amino acid level. We examine insertion of the regular A-beta peptide as well as mutants causing familial Alzheimer's disease, and find that all but one of the mutants change the insertion behavior by causing the peptide to spend more simulation steps in only one leaflet of the bilayer. We also find that A-beta 42, because of the extra hydrophobic residues relative to A-beta 40, is more likely to adopt this conformation than A-beta 40 in both wild-type and mutant forms. We argue qualitatively why these effects happen. Here, we present our results and develop the hypothesis that this partial insertion increases the probability of harmful channel formation. This hypothesis can partly explain why these mutations are neurotoxic simply due to peptide insertion behavior. We further apply this model to various artificial A-beta mutants which have been examined experimentally, and offer testable experimental predictions contrasting the roles of aggregation and insertion with regard to toxicity of A-beta mutants. These can be used through further experiments to test our hypothesis.",0
"A white neutron beam line using the back-streaming neutrons from the spallation target at China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS) is under construction. Different spectrometers mainly for nuclear data measurements to be installed in the so-called Back-n beam line are also under development in phases. The physics design of the beam line includes the overview of the characteristics of the neutron beam including energy spectrum, flux and time structure, and the optimizations of neutron beam spots and in-hall background with the help of a complicated collimation system and a sophisticated neutron dump. The wide neutron energy range of 1 eV~100 MeV is very good to support different applications, especially for nuclear data measurements. At Endstation#2 where is about 80 m from the target, the main properties include neutron flux of 106 n/cm2/s, time resolution of a few per mille over almost the whole energy range, in-hall background about 0.01 /cm2/s for both neutron and gamma. With its completion in late 2017, Back-n will be not only the first high-performance white neutron source in China, but also among the best white neutron sources in the world.",0
"3-flavor quark matter (strange quark matter; SQM) can be stable or metastable for a wide range of strong interaction parameters. If so, SQM can play an important role in cosmology, neutron stars, cosmic ray physics, and relativistic heavy-ion collisions. As an example of the intimate connections between astrophysics and heavy-ion collision physics, this Chapter gives an overview of the physical properties of SQM in bulk and of small-baryon number strangelets; discusses the possible formation, destruction, and implications of lumps of SQM (quark nuggets) in the early Universe; and describes the structure and signature of strange stars, as well as formation and detection of strangelets in cosmic rays. It is concluded, that astrophysical and laboratory searches are complementary in many respects, and that both should be pursued to test the intriguing possibility of a strange ground state for hadronic matter, and (more generally) to improve our knowledge of the strong interactions.",0
"The effects of electric field polarizations on pair production from a vacuum are investigated numerically by employing the real-time Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner formalism. For few-cycle fields, it is found that the interference pattern in momentum spectra is absent and the circular distortion of momentum distribution becomes more apparent with the increase of polarization. For multi-cycle fields, it is found that the interference effects in momentum spectra are obvious. And as the polarization increases, the momentum distribution is split into two parts in the momentum $q_y$ direction first and then two separated parts are connected into a ring. The effects of polarizations on the number density of created particles exhibits two different characteristics. For a small laser frequency, the particle number density deceases with the polarization, while for a large laser frequency, the relation between them is sensitive to the field frequency nonlinearly. Some interpretations for the obtained results in this study, which is expected to be valuable to deepen the understanding of pair production in complex fields and also helpful for the study associated to strong-field ionization.",0
"We develop a systematic variational coherent-squeezed-state expansion for the ground state of the quantum Rabi model, which includes an additional squeezing effect with comparisons to previous coherent-state approach. For finite large ratio between the atomic and field frequency, the essential feature of the ground-state wave function in the super-radiant phase appears, which has a structure of two delocalized wake packets. The single-peaked wave function with one coherent-squeezed state works well even around the critical regime, exhibiting the advantage over the coherent-state method. As the coupling increases to form strong correlations physics in the vicinity of phase transition, we develop an improved wave function with a structure of two Gaussian wave packets, which is a linear superposition of two coherent-squeezed state. The ground-state energy and the average photon number agree well with numerical ones even in the strong-correlated regimes, exhibiting a substantial improvement over the coherent-state expansion. The advantage of the coherent-squeezed-state expansion lies in the inclusion of the second coherent-squeezed state and the additional squeezed deformation of the wave function, providing a useful tool for multi-modes spin-boson coupling systems of greater complexity.",0
"We present a catalog of 49 spectroscopic strong gravitational lens candidates selected from a Sloan Digital Sky Survey sample of 50996 luminous red galaxies. Potentially lensed star-forming galaxies are detected through the presence of background oxygen and hydrogen nebular emission lines in the spectra of these massive foreground galaxies. This multiline selection eliminates the ambiguity of single-line identification and provides a very promising sample of candidate galaxy-galaxy lens systems at low to intermediate redshift, with foreground redshifts ranging from 0.16 to 0.49 and background redshifts from 0.25 to 0.81. Any lenses confirmed within our sample would be important new probes of early-type galaxy mass distributions, providing complementary constraints to those obtained from currently known lensed high-redshift quasars.",0
"We measure the morphology--density relation (MDR) and morphology-radius relation (MRR) for galaxies in seven z ~ 1 clusters that have been observed with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on board the Hubble Space Telescope. Simulations and independent comparisons of ourvisually derived morphologies indicate that ACS allows one to distinguish between E, S0, and spiral morphologies down to zmag = 24, corresponding to L/L* = 0.21 and 0.30 at z = 0.83 and z = 1.24, respectively. We adopt density and radius estimation methods that match those used at lower redshift in order to study the evolution of the MDR and MRR. We detect a change in the MDR between 0.8 < z < 1.2 and that observed at z ~ 0, consistent with recent work -- specifically, the growth in the bulge-dominated galaxy fraction, f_E+SO, with increasing density proceeds less rapidly at z ~ 1 than it does at z ~ 0. At z ~ 1 and density <= 500 galaxies/Mpc^2, we find <f_E+S0> = 0.72 +/- 0.10. At z ~ 0, an E+S0 population fraction of this magnitude occurs at densities about 5 times smaller. The evolution in the MDR is confined to densities >= 40 galaxies/Mpc^2 and appears to be primarily due to a deficit of S0 galaxies and an excess of Spiral+Irr galaxies relative to the local galaxy population. The Elliptical fraction - density relation exhibits no significant evolution between z = 1 and z = 0. We find mild evidence to suggest that the MDR is dependent on the bolometric X-ray luminosity of the intracluster medium. Implications for the evolution of the disk galaxy population in dense regions are discussed in the context of these observations.",0
"This study investigates the use of unsupervised word embeddings and sequence features for sample representation in an active learning framework built to extract clinical concepts from clinical free text. The objective is to further reduce the manual annotation effort while achieving higher effectiveness compared to a set of baseline features. Unsupervised features are derived from skip-gram word embeddings and a sequence representation approach. The comparative performance of unsupervised features and baseline hand-crafted features in an active learning framework are investigated using a wide range of selection criteria including least confidence, information diversity, information density and diversity, and domain knowledge informativeness. Two clinical datasets are used for evaluation: the i2b2/VA 2010 NLP challenge and the ShARe/CLEF 2013 eHealth Evaluation Lab. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in terms of effectiveness as well as annotation effort savings across both datasets. Using unsupervised features along with baseline features for sample representation lead to further savings of up to 9% and 10% of the token and concept annotation rates, respectively.",0
"Suzaku observations of a TeV unidentified (unID) source, HESS J1745-303, are presented. A possible excess of neutral iron line emission is discovered, and is likely associated with the main part of HESS J1745-303, named """"region A"""". It may be an X-ray reflection nebula where the X-rays from previous Galactic Center (GC) activity are reflected by a molecular cloud. This result further strengthens the assumption that the molecular cloud which is spatially coincident with region A of HESS J1745-303 is located in the GC region. The TeV emission from molecular clouds is reminiscent of the diffuse TeV gamma-rays from the GC giant molecular clouds, and it could have the same emission mechanism. With deep exposure mapping observations by Suzaku, a tight upper-limit on the 2-10 keV continuum diffuse emission from region A is obtained, as 2.1x10^-13ergs s^-1cm^-2. The flux ratio between 1-10 TeV and 2-10 keV is larger than 4. Possible scenarios to reproduce wide-band spectra from keV to TeV are examined. Thermal X-rays from nearby two old supernova remnants, G359.0-0.9 and G359.1-0.5, are detected, and their emission properties are well determined in the present study with deep exposure.",0
"In this paper, we provide a vacuum solution with torsion in quadratic Riemann-curvature gravity. Physically, the solution means that vacuum can have a nonzero vacuum field with large torsion. We show that the Einstein-Hilbert action can be derived if we expand the quadratic curvature of the Lagrangian in a torsion-free Riemannian space-time around a nonzero vacuum field. We also show that the cosmological constant caused by a nonzero vacuum field is equal to zero.",0
"In present paper a spherically symmetric stellar configuration has been analyzed by assuming the matter distribution of the stellar configuration is anisotropic in nature and compared with the realistic objects, namely, the low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and X-ray pulsars. The analytic solution has been obtained by utilizing the dark energy equation of state for the interior solution corresponding to the Schwarzschild exterior vacuum solution at the junction interface. Several physical properties like energy conditions, stability, mass-radius ratio, and surface redshift are described through mathematical calculations as well as graphical plots. It is found that obtained mass-radius ration of the compact stars candidates like 4U 1820-30, PSR J 1614-2230, Vela X-1 and Cen X-3 are very much consistent with the observed data by Gangopadhyay et al. (Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 431, 3216 (2013)). So our proposed model would be useful in the investigation of the possible clustering of dark energy.",0
"For most hierarchical triple stars, the classical double two-body model of zeroth-order cannot describe the motions of the components under the current observational accuracy. In this paper, Marchal's first-order analytical solution is implemented and a more efficient simplified version is applied to real triple stars. The results show that, for most triple stars, the proposed first-order model is preferable to the zeroth-order model both in fitting observational data and in predicting component positions.",0
"In this paper, we study the optimal multiple stopping problem under the filtration consistent nonlinear expectations. The reward is given by a set of random variables satisfying some appropriate assumptions rather than an RCLL process. We first construct the optimal stopping time for the single stopping problem, which is no longer given by the first hitting time of processes. We then prove by induction that the value function of the multiple stopping problem can be interpreted as the one for the single stopping problem associated with a new reward family, which allows us to construct the optimal multiple stopping times. If the reward family satisfies some strong regularity conditions, we show that the reward family and the value functions can be aggregated by some progressive processes. Hence, the optimal stopping times can be represented as hitting times.",0
"Estimating 3D human pose from monocular images demands large amounts of 3D pose and in-the-wild 2D pose annotated datasets which are costly and require sophisticated systems to acquire. In this regard, we propose a metric learning based approach to jointly learn a rich embedding and 3D pose regression from the embedding using multi-view synchronised videos of human motions and very limited 3D pose annotations. The inclusion of metric learning to the baseline pose estimation framework improves the performance by 21\% when 3D supervision is limited. In addition, we make use of a person-identity based adversarial loss as additional weak supervision to outperform state-of-the-art whilst using a much smaller network. Lastly, but importantly, we demonstrate the advantages of the learned embedding and establish view-invariant pose retrieval benchmarks on two popular, publicly available multi-view human pose datasets, Human 3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP, to facilitate future research.",0
"Calorons are finite action solutions to the anti-selfdual Yang-Mills equations on $\mathbb{R}^3\times S^1$. They are generally constructed by the so called Nahm construction. We perform the numerical Nahm transform for the Nahm data of 3-calorons with $C_3$-symmetry, which do not have the monopole limits. Dissimilar to the cases of having monopole limits, we can trace the zero-circumference limit of $S^1$.It is found that the action density of the calorons tends to fade away as $S^1$ shrinks.",0
"I study the interplay of errors with transversal gates in 3D color codes, and introduce some new such gates. Two features of the transversal T gate stand out: (i) it naturally defines a set of correctable errors, and (ii) it exhibits a `linking charge' phenomenon that is of interest for a wide class of 3D topologically ordered systems.",0
"We consider stable solutions to the equation $ -\Delta_p u =f(u) $ in a smooth bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n $ for a $ C^1 $ nonlinearity $f$. Either in the radial case, or for some model nonlinearities $f$ in a general domain, stable solutions are known to be bounded in the optimal dimension range $n<p+4p/(p-1)$. In this article, under a new condition on $n$ and $p$, we establish an $ L^\infty $ a priori estimate for stable solutions which holds for every $ f\in C^1$. Our condition is optimal in the radial case for $n\geq3$, whereas it is more restrictive in the nonradial case. This work improves the known results in the topic and gives a unified proof for the radial and the nonradial cases. The existence of an $L^\infty$ bound for stable solutions holding for all $C^1$ nonlinearities when $n<p+4p/(p-1)$ has been an open problem over the last twenty years. A forthcoming paper by Cabr\'e, Sanch\'on, and the author will solve it when $p>2$.",0
"A self-consistent model for binary evolution devised by Gingold \& Monaghan (1980) is used to show that two distinctly different types of behaviour are possible for close eccentric binaries. The model is based on a linear adiabatic normal mode analysis of the problem, which allows detailed examination of the transfer of energy from the orbit to the tides. We show that for most binaries, energy is exchanged quasi-periodically, with the system regulating itself so that the maximum tidal energy always remains small, and no circularization takes place. In contrast, for a range of eccentricities and periastron separations, {\it chaotic} behaviour prevails, with the eccentricity following a random walk and with the energy transferred to the tides during a single periastron passage being up to an order of magnitude larger than that transferred during the initial periastron passage. These results have important consequences for the study of tidal capture binaries. The standard model (see, for example, McMillan, McDermott \& Taam 1987) assumes that the energy transferred to the tides during a periastron encounter is independent of the oscillatory state of the stars, and that the amount of tidal energy present at any time can be calculated using a formula which (accurately) gives the amount deposited after the first encounter (Press \& Teukolsky 1977). The calculations presented here show that a self-consistent treatment is necessary in order to study the dynamical evolution of tidal capture binaries. We conclude that the tidal capture process would not be possible were it not for the existence of chaotic behaviour.",0
The Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) multi-wall solutions are constructed in supersymmetric U(N_C) gauge theories in five dimensions with N_F(>N_C) hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation. Exact solutions are obtained with full generic moduli for infinite gauge coupling and with partial moduli for finite gauge coupling. The generic wall solutions require nontrivial configurations for either gauge fields or off-diagonal components of adjoint scalars depending on the gauge. Effective theories of moduli fields are constructed as world-volume gauge theories. Nambu-Goldstone and quasi-Nambu-Goldstone scalars are distinguished and worked out. Total moduli space of the BPS non-Abelian walls including all topological sectors is found to be the complex Grassmann manifold SU(N_F) / [SU(N_C) x SU(N_F-N_C) x U(1)] endowed with a deformed metric.,0
"The spin orbit coupling spin torque consists of the field-like [REF: S.G. Tan et al., arXiv:0705.3502, (2007).] and the damping-like terms [REF: H. Kurebayashi et al., Nature Nanotechnology 9, 211 (2014).] that have been widely studied for applications in magnetic memory. We focus, in this article, not on the spin orbit effect producing the above spin torques, but on its magnifying the damping constant of all field like spin torques. As first order precession leads to second order damping, the Rashba constant is naturally co-opted, producing a magnified field-like damping effect. The Landau-Liftshitz-Gilbert equations are written separately for the local magnetization and the itinerant spin, allowing the progression of magnetization to be self-consistently locked to the spin.",0
"We present ground-based and HST optical and infrared observations of XRF 100316D / SN 2010bh. It is seen that the optical light curves of SN 2010bh evolve at a faster rate than the archetype GRB-SN 1998bw, but at a similar rate to SN 2006aj, a supernova that was spectroscopically linked with XRF 060218, and at a similar rate to non-GRB associated type Ic SN 1994I. We estimate the rest-frame extinction of this event from our optical data to be E(B-V)=0.18 +/- 0.08 mag. We find the V-band absolute magnitude of SN 2010bh to be M_{V}=-18.62 +/- 0.08, which is the faintest peak V-band magnitude observed to-date for a spectroscopically-confirmed GRB-SNe. When we investigate the origin of the flux at t-t_{o}=0.598 days, it is shown that the light is not synchrotron in origin, but is likely coming from the supernova shock break-out. We then use our optical and infrared data to create a quasi-bolometric light curve of SN 2010bh which we model with a simple analytical formula. The results of our modeling imply that SN 2010bh synthesized a nickel mass of M_{Ni} \approx 0.10 M_{sun}, ejected M_{ej} \approx 2.2 M_{sun} and has an explosion energy of E_{k} \approx 1.4 x 10^{52} erg. Finally, for a sample 22 GRB-SNe we check for a correlation between the stretch factors and luminosity factors in the R band and conclude that no statistically-significant correlation exists.",0
"The prospect of RNA nanotechnology is increasing because of its numerous potential applications especially in medical science. The spherical Nanodiamonds (NDs) are becoming popular because of their lesser toxicity, desirable mechanical, optical properties, functionality and available surface areas. On other hand RNAs are stable, flexible and easy to bind to the NDs. In this work, we have studied the tRNA dynamics on ND surface by high-resolution quasi-elastic neutron scattering spectroscopy and all atom molecular dynamics simulation technique to understand how the tRNA motion is affected by the presence of ND. The flexibly of the tRNA is analyzed by the Mean square displacement analysis that shows tRNA have a sharp increase around 230K in its hydrated form. The intermediate scattering function (ISF) representing the tRNA dynamics follows the logarithmic decay as proposed by the Mode Coupling theory (MCT). But most importantly the tRNA dynamics is found to be faster in presence of ND within 220K to 310K compared to the freestanding ones. This is as we have shown, is because of the swollen RNA molecule due the introduction of hydrophilic ND surface.",0
A search for inelastic scattering of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) on the isotope $^{129}$Xe was done in data taken with the single phase liquid xenon detector XMASS at the Kamioka Observatory. Using a restricted volume containing 41 kg of LXe at the very center of our detector we observed no significant excess of events in 165.9 days of data. Our background reduction allowed us to derive our limits without explicitly subtracting the remaining events which are compatible with background expectations and derive for e.g. a 50 GeV WIMP an upper limit for its inelastic cross section on $^{129}$Xe nuclei of 3.2 pb at the 90% confidence level.,0
"Heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory is briefly reviewed, paying particular attention to the role of the spin 3/2 delta resonances. The concept of resonance saturation for the baryonic sector is critically discussed. Starting from a relativistic formulation of the pion-nucleon-delta system, the heavy baryon chiral lagrangian including spin 3/2 resonances is constructed by means of a 1/m-expansion. The effective theory obtained admits a systematic expansion in terms of soft momenta, the pion mass $M_\pi$ and the delta-nucleon mass difference $\Delta$.",0
"For a second-order elliptic equation in divergence form we investigate conditions on the coefficients which imply that all solutions are Lipschitz continuous or differentiable at a given point. We assume the coefficients have modulus of continuity satisfying the square-Dini condition, and obtain additional conditions that examples show are sharp. Our results extend those of previous authors who assume the modulus of continuity satisfies the Dini condition. Our method involves the study of asymptotic properties of solutions to a dynamical system that is derived from the coefficients of the elliptic equation.",0
"We perform a scaling analysis of the mean velocity of extended magnetic domain walls driven in ultrathin Pt/Co/Pt ferromagnetic films with perpendicular anisotropy, as a function of the applied external field for different film-thicknesses. We find that the scaling of the experimental data around the thermally rounded depinning transition is consistent with the universal depinning exponents theoretically expected for elastic interfaces described by the one-dimensional quenched Edwards-Wilkinson equation. In particular, values for the depinning exponent $\beta$ and thermal rounding exponent $\psi$ are tested and the present analysis of the experimental data is compatible with $\beta=0.33$ and $\psi=0.2$, in agreement with numerical simulations.",0
"A solution to the Kervaire invariant problem is presented. We introduce the concepts of abelian structure on skew-framed immersions, bicyclic structure on $\Z/2^{[3]}$--framed immersions, and quaternionic-cyclic structure on $\Z/2^{[4]}$--framed immersions. Using these concepts, we prove that for sufficiently large $n$, $n=2^{\ell}-2$, an arbitrary skew-framed immersion in Euclidean $n$-space $\R^n$ has zero Kervaire invariant. Additionally, for $\ell \ge 12$ (i.e., for $n \ge 4094$) an arbitrary skew-framed immersion in Euclidean $n$-space $\R^n$ has zero Kervaire invariant if this skew-framed immersion admits a compression of order 16.",0
Some improvements of Young inequality and its reverse for positive numbers with Kontrovich constant are given. Using these inequalities some operator versions and Hilbert-Schmidt norm versions for matrices are proved.,0
"In this article, we use quasifree reduction to derive the time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) equations describing the dynamics of quantum fluctuations around a Bose-Einstein condensate in $\mathbb R^d$. We prove global well-posedness for the HFB equations for sufficiently regular pair interaction potentials, and establish key conservation laws. Moreover, we show that the solutions to the HFB equations exhibit a symplectic structure, and have a form reminiscent of a Hamiltonian system. In particular, this is used to relate the HFB equations to the HFB eigenvalue equations encountered in the physics literature. Furthermore, we construct the Gibbs states at positive temperature associated with the HFB equations, and establish criteria for the emergence of Bose-Einstein condensation.",0
"Using a first principles approach, we study the electron transport properties of a new class of molecular wires containing fluorenone units, whose features open up new possibilities for controlling transport through a single molecule. We show that the presence of side groups attached to these units leads to Fano resonances close to the Fermi energy. As a consequence electron transport through the molecule can be controlled either by chemically modifying the side group, or by changing the conformation of the side group. This sensitivity, opens up new possibilities for novel single-molecule sensors. We also show that transport can be controlled by tilting a molecule with respect to the electrode surfaces. Our results compare favorably with recent experiments.",0
"A new canonical divergence is put forward for generalizing an information-geometric measure of complexity for both, classical and quantum systems. On the simplex of probability measures it is proved that the new divergence coincides with the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which is used to quantify how much a probability measure deviates from the non-interacting states that are modeled by exponential families of probabilities. On the space of positive density operators, we prove that the same divergence reduces to the quantum relative entropy, which quantifies many-party correlations of a quantum state from a Gibbs family.",0
A model with non-uniform flow in the longitudinal direction is proposed for the relativistic heavy-ion collisions and compared with the 14.6 A GeV/c Si-Al and 10.8 A GeV/c Au-Au collision data. The stronger influence of transparency on the distribution of heavier produced particles and the larger stopping in the heavier collision system are accounted for by using a new geometrical parameterization picture. The central dips in the proton and deuteron rapidity distributions for Si-Al collision are reproduced.,0
"How do massive stars explode? Progress toward the answer is driven by increases in compute power.

We propose a score function for Bayesian clustering. The function is parameter free and captures the interplay between the within cluster variance and the between cluster entropy of a clustering. It can be used to choose the number of clusters in well-established clustering methods such as hierarchical clustering or $K$-means algorithm.,0
"Young and rapidly rotating stars are known for intense, dynamo generated magnetic fields. Spectropolarimetric observations of those stars in precisely aged clusters are key input for gyrochronology and magnetochronology. We use ZDI maps of several young K-type stars of similar mass and radius but with various ages and rotational periods, to perform 3D numerical MHD simulations of their coronae and follow the evolution of their magnetic properties with age. Those simulations yield the coronal structure as well as the instant torque exerted by the magnetized, rotating wind on the star. As stars get older, we find that the angular momentum loss decreases with $\Omega^3$, which is the reason for the convergence on the Skumanich law. For the youngest stars of our sample, the angular momentum loss show signs of saturation around $8\Omega_{\odot}$, which is a common value used in spin evolution models for K-type stars. We compare these results to semi-analytical models and existing braking laws. We observe a complex wind speed distribution for the youngest stars with slow, intermediate and fast wind components, which are the result of the interaction with intense and non axisymmetric magnetic fields. Consequently, in our simulations, the stellar wind structure in the equatorial plane of young stars varies significantly from a solar configuration, delivering insight about the past of the solar system interplanetary medium.",0
"X-ray and neutron scattering studies of the lead-based family of perovskite relaxors PZN-$x$PT and PMN-$x$PT have documented a highly unusual situation in which the near-surface region of a single crystal can exhibit a structure that is different from that of the bulk when cooled to low temperatures. The near-surface region, or """"skin"""" can also display critical behavior that is absent in the crystal interior, as well as a significantly different lattice spacing. By varying the incident photon energy, and thus the effective penetration depth, x-ray measurements indicate a skin thickness of order 10 $\mu$m to 50 $\mu$m for PZN-$x$PT samples with $0 \le x \le 8$%. Neutron residual stress measurements on a large PMN single crystal reveal a uniform lattice spacing within the bulk, but an increased strain near the surface. The presence of this skin effect has led to incorrect phase diagrams for both the PZN-$x$PT and PMN-$x$PT systems and erroneous characterizations of the nature of the relaxor state.",0
"In this paper we consider the wave equations for hypoelliptic homogeneous left-invariant operators on graded Lie groups with time-dependent H\""""older propagation speeds. The examples are the time-dependent wave equation for the sub-Laplacian on the Heisenberg group or on general stratified Lie groups, or $p$-evolution equations for higher order operators, already in all these cases our results being new. We establish sharp well-posedness results in the spirit of the classical result by Colombini, de Giorgi and Spagnolo. In particular, we describe an interesting loss of regularity phenomenon depending on the step of the group and on the order of the considered operator.",0

"We study the predicted sub-mm emission from massive galaxies in a Lambda-CDM universe, using hydrodynamic cosmological simulations. Assuming that most of the emission from newly formed stars is absorbed and reradiated in the rest-frame far-IR, we calculate the number of galaxies that would be detected in sub-mm surveys conducted with SCUBA. The predicted number counts are strongly dependent on the assumed dust temperature and emissivity law. With plausible choices for SED parameters (e.g., T=35 K, beta=1.0), the simulation predictions reproduce the observed number counts above ~ 1 mJy. The sources have a broad redshift distribution with median z ~ 2, in reasonable agreement with observational constraints. However, the predicted count distribution may be too steep at the faint end, and the fraction of low redshift objects may be larger than observed. In this physical model of the sub-mm galaxy population, the objects detected in existing surveys consist mainly of massive galaxies (several M_*) forming stars fairly steadily over timescales ~ 10^8-10^9 years, at moderate rates ~100 Msun/yr. The typical descendants of these sub-mm sources are even more massive galaxies, with old stellar populations, found primarily in dense environments. While the resolution of our simulations is not sufficient to determine galaxy morphologies, these properties support the proposed identification of sub-mm sources with massive ellipticals in the process of formation. The most robust and distinctive prediction of this model, stemming directly from the long timescale and correspondingly moderate rate of star formation, is that the far-IR SEDs of SCUBA sources have a relative high 850 micron luminosity for a given bolometric luminosity.

"We study a model of a $p$-$n$ junction in single-layer graphene in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field and spin-orbit interactions. By solving the relevant quantum-mechanical problem for a potential step, we determine the exact spectrum of spin-resolved dispersive Landau levels. Close to zero energy, we find a pair of linearly dispersing zero modes, which possess a wave-vector-dependent spin polarization and can be regarded as quantum analogous of spinful snake states. We show that the Rashba spin-orbit interaction, in particular, produces a wave vector shift between the dispersions of these modes with observable interference effects. These effects can in principle provide a way to detect the presence of Rashba spin-orbit interaction and measure its strength. Our results suggest that a graphene $p$-$n$ junction in the presence of strong spin-orbit interaction could be used as a building block in a spin field-effect transistor.",0
The new forward Muon Piston Calorimeters allow PHENIX to explore low-$x$ parton distributions in d+Au collisions with hopes of observing gluon saturation. We present a two-particle azimuthal $\Delta \phi$ correlation measurement made between a mid-rapidity particle ($|\eta_1| < 0.35$) and a forward $\pi^0$ ($3.1 < \eta_2 < 3.9$) wherein we compare correlation widths in d+Au to p+p and compute $I_{dA}$.,0
"Information-centric networking proposals attract much attention in the ongoing search for a future communication paradigm of the Internet. Replacing the host-to-host connectivity by a data-oriented publish/subscribe service eases content distribution and authentication by concept, while eliminating threats from unwanted traffic at an end host as are common in today's Internet. However, current approaches to content routing heavily rely on data-driven protocol events and thereby introduce a strong coupling of the control to the data plane in the underlying routing infrastructure. In this paper, threats to the stability and security of the content distribution system are analyzed in theory and practical experiments. We derive relations between state resources and the performance of routers and demonstrate how this coupling can be misused in practice. We discuss new attack vectors present in its current state of development, as well as possibilities and limitations to mitigate them.",0
"We systematically explore the new method of construction (known as the propus construction) of symmetric Hadamard matrices for small orders, $4v$.

"Solvent structure and dynamics of acetonitrile at its liquid-vapor (LV) interface and at the acetonitrile-silica (LS) interface are studied by means of molecular dynamics simulations. We set up the interfacial system and treat the long-ranged electrostatics carefully to obtain both stable LV and LS interfaces within the same system. Single molecule (singlet) and correlated density orientational profiles and singlet and collective reorientational dynamics are reported for both interfaces. At the LS interface acetonitrile forms layers. The closest sublayer is dominated by nitrogen atoms bonding to the hydrogen sites of the silica surface. The singlet molecular reorientation is strongly hindered when close to the silica surface, but at the LV interface it relaxes much faster than in the bulk. Antiparallel correlations between acetonitrile molecules at the LV interface are even stronger than in the bulk liquid phase. This strong antiparallel correlation disappears at the LS interface. The collective reorientational relaxation of the first layer acetonitrile is much faster than the singlet reorientational relaxation but it is still slower than in the bulk. These results are interpreted with reference to a variety of recent experiments. We found that defining interface properties based on the distribution of positions of different choices of atoms or sites within the molecule leads to apparently different orientational profiles, especially at the LV interface. We provide a general formulation showing that this ambiguity arises when the size of the molecule is comparable to the interfacial width and is particularly significant when there is a large difference in density at the upper and lower boundaries of the interface. We finally analyze the effect of electrostatics to show the necessity of properly treating long-ranged electrostatics for simulations of interfacial systems.",0
"We report measurements of the in-plane electrical resistivity $\rho$ and the thermal conductivity $\kappa$ of the intercalated graphite superconductor C$_6$Yb to temperatures as low as $T_c$/100. When a field is applied along the c-axis, the residual electronic linear term $\kappa_0/T$ evolves in an exponential manner for $H_{c1} < H < H_{c2}$. This activated behaviour establishes the order parameter as unambiguously s-wave, and rules out the possibility of multi-gap or unconventional superconductivity in this system.",0
"We perform a principal component analysis (PCA) of $v_3(p_T)$ in event-by-event hydrodynamic simulations of Pb+Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The PCA procedure identifies two dominant contributions to the two-particle correlation function, which together capture 99.9\% of the squared variance. We find that the subleading flow (which is the largest source of flow factorization breaking in hydrodynamics) is predominantly a response to the radial excitations of a third-order eccentricity. We present a systematic study of the hydrodynamic response to these radial excitations in 2+1D viscous hydrodynamics. Finally, we construct a good geometrical predictor for the orientation angle and magnitude of the leading and subleading flows using two Fourier modes of the initial geometry.",0
"We investigate feedback control for infinite horizon optimal control problems for partial differential equations. The method is based on the coupling between Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations and model reduction techniques. It is well-known that HJB equations suffer the so called curse of dimensionality and, therefore, a reduction of the dimension of the system is mandatory. In this report we focus on the infinite horizon optimal control problem with quadratic cost functionals. We compare several model reduction methods such as Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, Balanced Truncation and a new algebraic Riccati equation based approach. Finally, we present numerical examples and discuss several features of the different methods analyzing advantages and disadvantages of the reduction methods.",0
"We present deep ground-based {\it B} and {\it R} observations of 12 fields in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The resulting color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) reach the oldest main-sequence (MS) turnoff at M$_{R}$$\thicksim$3.5 and reveal the stellar population differences between the part of the galaxy facing the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and an area on the opposite side. In the Southern part of the galaxy, we found that there are still intermediate-age stars as far as 4 kpc from the SMC center. The Chemical Enrichment History (CEH) in one of our SMC fields is also presented.",0
"We implement the theory of resonant scattering in the context of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarisation anisotropies. We compute the changes in the E-mode polarisation (EE) and Temperature E-mode (TE) CMB power spectra introduced by the scattering on a resonant transition with a given optical depth $\tau_X$ and polarisation coefficient $E_1$. The latter parameter, accounting for how anisotropic the scattering is, depends on the exchange of angular momentum in the transition and enables, {\it a priori}, to distinguish among different possible resonances. We use this formalism in two different scenarios: cosmological recombination and cosmological reionisation. In the context of cosmological recombination, we compute predictions in frequency and multipole space for the change in the TE and EE power spectra introduced by scattering on the $H_{\alpha}$ and $P_{\alpha}$ lines of Hydrogen. This constitutes a fundamental test for the standard model of recombination, and the sensitivity it requires is comparable to that needed in measuring the primordial CMB B-mode polarisation component. In the context of reionisation, we study the scattering off metals and ions produced by the first stars, and find that polarisation anisotropies, apart from providing a consistency test for intensity measurements, give some insight on how reionisation evolved: since they keep memory of how anisotropic the line scattering is, they should be able to discern the OI 63.2$\mu$m transition from other possible transitions associated to OIII, NII, NIII, etc. The amplitude of these signals are, however, between 10 to 100 times below the (already challenging) level of CMB B-mode polarisation anisotropies.",0
"Kinetic-transport equations are, by now, standard models to describe the dynamics of populations of bacteria moving by run-and-tumble. Experimental observations show that bacteria increase their run duration when encountering an increasing gradient of chemotactic molecules. This led to a first class of models which heuristically include tumbling frequencies depending on the path-wise gradient of chemotactic signal. More recently, the biochemical pathways regulating the flagellar motors were uncovered. This knowledge gave rise to a second class of kinetic-transport equations, that takes into account an intra-cellular molecular content and which relates the tumbling frequency to this information. It turns out that the tumbling frequency depends on the chemotactic signal, and not on its gradient. For these two classes of models, macroscopic equations of Keller-Segel type, have been derived using diffusion or hyperbolic rescaling. We complete this program by showing how the first class of equations can be derived from the second class with molecular content after appropriate rescaling. The main difficulty is to explain why the path-wise gradient of chemotactic signal can arise in this asymptotic process. Randomness of receptor methylation events can be included, and our approach can be used to compute the tumbling frequency in presence of such a noise.",0
"An exact mapping is established between sequence alignment, one of the most commonly used tools of computational biology, and the asymmetric exclusion process, one of the few exactly solvable models of nonequilibrium physics. The statistical significance of sequence alignments is characterized through studying the total hopping current of the discrete time and space version of the asymmetric exclusion process.",0
"In this dissertation we discuss various issues concerning application of the Dijkgraaf-Vafa (DV) conjecture to the study of supersymmetric gauge theories. The DV approach is very powerful in that it provides a systematic way of computing the nonperturbative, often even exact, superpotential of the system, which was possible only on a case-by-case basis in the more traditional approach based on holomorphy and symmetry. This conjecture has been checked for many nontrivial examples, but the range of its applicability remained unclear. We give an explicit example, Sp(N) theory with antisymmetric tensor, which reveals the subtleties in applying the conjecture. We show that, the superpotential obtained by a straightforward application of the DV approach starts to disagree with the standard gauge theory result at N/2+1 loops. The same discrepancy is reproduced in the generalized Konishi anomaly method. In order to look for the physical origin of the discrepancy, we consider the string theory realization of the gauge theories by Calabi-Yau compactifications. By closely analyzing the physics that accompanies the geometric transitions involved, we clarify the prescription regarding when to include a glueball field as the physical field, and when to not. In particular, the aforementioned discrepancy is resolved if we follow this prescription and introduce a glueball field for the """"Sp(0)"""" group. Furthermore, we generalize the prescription to include flavors and demonstrate that the matrix model computations with the generalized prescription correctly reproduce the gauge theory results.",0
"We investigate multipartite entanglement for composite quantum systems in a pure state. Using the generalized Bloch representation for n-qubit states, we express the condition that all k-qubit reductions of the whole system are maximally mixed, reflecting maximum bipartite entanglement across all k vs. n-k bipartitions. As a special case, we examine the class of balanced pure states, which are constructed from a subset of the Pauli group P_n that is isomorphic to Z_2^n. This makes a connection with the theory of quantum error-correcting codes and provides bounds on the largest allowed k for fixed n. In particular, the ratio k/n can be lower and upper bounded in the asymptotic regime, implying that there must exist multipartite entangled states with at least k=0.189 n when $n\to \infty$. We also analyze symmetric states as another natural class of states with high multipartite entanglement and prove that, surprisingly, they cannot have all maximally mixed k-qubit reductions with k>1. Thus, measured through bipartite entanglement across all bipartitions, symmetric states cannot exhibit large entanglement. However, we show that the permutation symmetry only constrains some components of the generalized Bloch vector, so that very specific patterns in this vector may be allowed even though k>1 is forbidden. This is illustrated numerically for a few symmetric states that maximize geometric entanglement, revealing some interesting structures.",0
"We construct a solvable spin chain model of many-body localization (MBL) with a tunable mobility edge. This simple model not only demonstrates analytically the existence of mobility edges in interacting one-dimensional (1D) disordered systems, but also allows us to study their physics. By establishing a connection between MBL and a quantum central limit theorem (QCLT), we show that many-body localization-delocalization transitions can be visualized as tuning a mobility edge in the energy spectrum. Since the effective disorder strength for individual eigenstates depends on energy density, we identify """"energy-resolved disorder strength"""" as a physical mechanism for the appearance of mobility edges, and support the universality of this mechanism by arguing its presence in a large class of models including the random-field Heisenberg chain. We also construct models with multiple mobility edges. All our constructions can be made translationally invariant.",0
"We investigate spatial distributions of specific dust components in the circumstellar shells of a proto-planetary nebula candidate, HD 179821, and a planetary nebula, BD$+30^{\circ}$3639, by means of spectral imaging. With high-resolution ground-based images and ISO spectra in the mid-infrared, we can derive ``dust feature only'' maps by subtracting synthesized continuum maps from the observed images at the feature wavelength. Such spatially detailed information will help to develop models for the evolution of dust grains around evolved stars.",0
"Context: BL Lacertae objects have been the targets for numerous recent multiwavelength campaigns, continuum spectral variability studies, and theoretical spectral and variability modeling. A meaningful interpretation of the results of such studies requires a reliable knowledge of the objects' redshifts; however, the redshifts for many are still unknown or uncertain. Aims: Therefore, we hope to determine or constrain the redshifts of six BL Lac objects with unknown or poorly known redshifts. Methods: Observations were made of these objects with the MDM 2.4 m Hiltner telescope. Although no spectral features were detected, and thus no redshifts could be measured, lower redshift limits were assigned to the objects based on the expected equivalent widths of absorption features in their host galaxies. Redshifts were also estimated for some objects by assuming the host galaxies are standard candles and using host galaxy apparent magnitudes taken from the literature. Results: The commonly used redshift of $z=0.102$ for 1219+285 is almost certainly wrong, while the redshifts of the other objects studied remain undetermined.",0
"We analyze type I vacuum solutions admitting an isometry whose Killing 2--form is aligned with a principal bivector of the Weyl tensor, and we show that these solutions belong to a family of type I metrics which admit a group $G_3$ of isometries. We give a classification of this family and we study the Bianchi type for each class. The classes compatible with an aligned Killing 2--form are also determined. The Szekeres-Brans theorem is extended to non vacuum spacetimes with vanishing Cotton tensor.",0
The following paper presents various methods and implementation techniques used to harvest metadata efficiently from a Kademlia Distributed Hashtable (DHT) as used in the BitTorrent P2P network to build an index of publicly available files in the BitTorrent ecosystem. The indexer design makes various tradeoffs between throughput and fairness towards other DHT nodes while also being scaleable in a distributed environment.,0
"We define the notion of normal A-schemes, and approximable A-schemes. Approximable A-schemes inherit many good properties of ordinary schemes. As a consequence, we see that the Zariski-Riemann space can be regarded in two ways -- either as the limit space of admissible blow ups, or as the universal compactification of the given non-proper scheme. We can prove Nagata embedding using Zariski-Riemann spaces.",0
"Effective methods of fluid transport vary across scale. A commonly used dimensionless number for quantifying the effective scale of fluid transport is the Reynolds number, Re, which gives the ratio of inertial to viscous forces. What may work well for one Re regime may not produce significant flows for another. These differences in scale have implications for many organisms, ranging from the mechanics of how organisms move through their fluid environment to how hearts pump at various stages in development. Some organisms, such as soft pulsing corals, actively contract their tentacles to generate mixing currents that enhance photosynthesis. Their unique morphology and intermediate scale where both viscous and inertial forces are significant make them a unique model organism for understanding fluid mixing. In this paper, 3D fluid-structure interaction simulations of a pulsing soft coral are used to quantify fluid transport and fluid mixing across a wide range of Re. The results show that net transport is negligible for $Re<10$, and continuous upward flow is produced for $Re\geq 10$.",0
"Battery-powered sensors deployed in the Internet of Things (IoT) require energy-efficient solutions to prolong their lifetime. When these sensors observe a physical phenomenon distributed in space and evolving in time, the collected observations are expected to be correlated. We take advantage of the exhibited correlation and propose an updating mechanism that employs deep Q-learning. Our mechanism is capable of determining the frequency with which sensors should transmit their updates while taking into the consideration an ever-changing environment. We evaluate our solution using observations obtained in a real deployment, and show that our proposed mechanism is capable of significantly extending battery-powered sensors' lifetime without compromising the accuracy of the observations provided to the IoT service.",0
"We propose an operational definition for the local temperature of a quantum field employing Unruh-DeWitt detectors, as used in the study of the Unruh and Hawking effects. With this definition, an inhomogeneous quantum system in equilibrium can have different local temperatures, in analogy with the Tolman-Ehrenfest theorem from general relativity. We study the local temperature distribution on the ground state of hopping fermionic systems on a curved background. The observed temperature tends to zero as the thermometer-system coupling $g$ vanishes. Yet, for small but finite values of $g$, we show that the product of the observed local temperature and the logarithm of the local speed of light is approximately constant. Our predictions should be testable on ultracold atomic systems.",0
"We report ESO-VLT near-infrared adaptive optics imaging of one radio-loud (PKS 0113-283) and two radio-quiet (Q 0045-3337 and Q 0101-337) QSOs at z > 2. In the first case, we are able to resolve the QSO and find that it is hosted by an elliptical of absolute magnitude M(K) = -27.6. For the other two objects, no extended emission has been unambiguously detected. This result, though restricted to a single object, extends up to z ~2.5 the finding that cosmic evolution of radio-loud QSO hosts follows the trend expected for luminous and massive spheroids undergoing passive evolution. For Q 0045-3337, our high resolution images show that it is located 1.2 arcsec from a K = 17.5 foreground disc galaxy, which may act as a gravitational lens, since the QSO most probably lies within the galaxy Einstein radius.",0
"We consider inflation in the system containing a Ricci scalar squared term and a canonical scalar field with quadratic mass term. In the Einstein frame this model takes the form of a two-field inflation model with a curved field space, and under the slow-roll approximation contains four free parameters corresponding to the masses of the two fields and their initial positions. We investigate how the inflationary dynamics and predictions for the primordial curvature perturbation depend on these four parameters. Our analysis is based on the $\delta N$ formalism, which allows us to determine predictions for the non-Gaussianity of the curvature perturbation as well as for quantities relating to its power spectrum. Depending on the choice of parameters, we find predictions that range from those of $R^2$ inflation to those of quadratic chaotic inflation, with the non-Gaussianity of the curvature perturbation always remaining small. Using our results we are able to put constraints on the masses of the two fields.",0
"Several researchers have recently established that for every Turing degree $\boldsymbol{c}$, the real closed field of all $\boldsymbol{c}$-computable real numbers has spectrum $\{\boldsymbol{d}~:~\boldsymbol{d}'\geq\boldsymbol{c}""""\}$. We investigate the spectra of real closed fields further, focusing first on subfields of the field $\mathbb{R}_{\boldsymbol{0}}$ of computable real numbers, then on archimedean real closed fields more generally, and finally on non-archimedean real closed fields. For each noncomputable, computably enumerable set $C$, we produce a real closed $C$-computable subfield of $\mathbb{R}_{\boldsymbol{0}}$ with no computable copy. Then we build an archimedean real closed field with no computable copy but with a computable enumeration of the Dedekind cuts it realizes, and a computably presentable nonarchimedean real closed field whose residue field has no computable presentation.",0
"We consider the normal phase of a strongly interacting Fermi gas, which can have either an equal or an unequal number of atoms in its two accessible spin states. Due to the unitarity-limited attractive interaction between particles with different spin, noncondensed Cooper pairs are formed. The starting point in treating preformed pairs is the Nozi\`{e}res-Schmitt-Rink (NSR) theory, which approximates the pairs as being noninteracting. Here, we consider the effects of the interactions between the Cooper pairs in a Wilsonian renormalization-group scheme. Starting from the exact bosonic action for the pairs, we calculate the Cooper-pair self-energy by combining the NSR formalism with the Wilsonian approach. We compare our findings with the recent experiments by Harikoshi {\it et al.} [Science {\bf 327}, 442 (2010)] and Nascimb\`{e}ne {\it et al.} [Nature {\bf 463}, 1057 (2010)], and find very good agreement. We also make predictions for the population-imbalanced case, that can be tested in experiments.",0
"It is known that the Principal Poincar\'e Pontryagin Function is generically an Abelian integral. We give a sufficient condition on monodromy to ensure that it is an Abelian integral also in non generic cases. In non generic cases it is an iterated integral. Uribe [17, 18] gives in a special case a precise description of the Principal Poincar\'e Pontryagin Function, an iterated integral of length at most 2, involving logarithmic functions with only one ramification at a point at infinity. We extend this result to some non isodromic families of real Morse polynomials.",0
"We propose a very simple preprocessing algorithm for semidefinite programming. Our algorithm inspects the constraints of the problem, deletes redundant rows and columns in the constraints, and reduces the size of the variable matrix. It often detects infeasibility. Our algorithm does not rely on any optimization solver: the only subroutine it needs is Cholesky factorization, hence it can be implemented with a few lines of code in machine precision. We present computational results on a set of problems arising mostly from polynomial optimization.",0
"It has recently been suggested that the driven lattice gas should be described by a novel field theory in the limit of infinite drive. We review the original and the new field theory, invoking several well-documented key features of the microscopics. Since the new field theory fails to reproduce these characteristics, we argue that it cannot serve as a viable description of the driven lattice gas. Recent results, for the critical exponents associated with this theory, are re-analyzed and shown to be incorrect.",0
Various aspects of distillation of noisy entanglement and some associated effects in quantum error correction are considered. In particular we prove that if only one--way classical communication (from Alice to Bob) is allowed and the shared $d \otimes d$ state is not pure then there is a threshold for optimal entanglement fraction $F$ of the state (being an overlap between the shared state and symmetric maximally entangled state) which can be obtained in single copy distillation process. This implies that to get (probabilistically) arbitrary good conclusive teleportation via mixed state at least one classical bit of backward communication (for Bob to Alice) has to be sent. We provide several other threshold properties in this context including in particular the existence of ultimate threshold of optimal $F$ for states of full rank. Finally the threshold results are linked to those of error correction. Namely it is pointed out that in quantum computer working on fixed number of quantum bits almost any kind of noise can be (probabilistically) corrected only to some threshold error bar though there are some (rare) exceptions.,0

"This paper develops new methodology, together with related theories, for combining information from independent studies through confidence distributions. A formal definition of a confidence distribution and its asymptotic counterpart (i.e., asymptotic confidence distribution) are given and illustrated in the context of combining information. Two general combination methods are developed: the first along the lines of combining p-values, with some notable differences in regard to optimality of Bahadur type efficiency; the second by multiplying and normalizing confidence densities. The latter approach is inspired by the common approach of multiplying likelihood functions for combining parametric information. The paper also develops adaptive combining methods, with supporting asymptotic theory which should be of practical interest. The key point of the adaptive development is that the methods attempt to combine only the correct information, downweighting or excluding studies containing little or wrong information about the true parameter of interest. The combination methodologies are illustrated in simulated and real data examples with a variety of applications.",0
"The purpose of this article is to show that when dynamically cold, dissipationless self-gravitating systems collapse, their evolution is a strong function of the symmetry in the initial distribution. We explore with a set of pressure-less homogeneous fluids the time-evolution of ellipsoidal distributions and map the depth of potential achieved during relaxation as function of initial ellipsoid axis ratios. We then perform a series of $N$-body numerical simulations and contrast their evolution with the fluid solutions. We verify an analytic relation between collapse factor ${\cal C}$ and particle number $N$ in spherical symmetry, such that ${\cal C} \propto N^{1/3}$. We sought a similar relation for axisymmetric configurations, and found an empirical scaling relation such that ${\cal C} \propto N^{1/6}$ in these cases. We then show that when mass distributions do not respect spherical- or axial-symmetry, the ensuing gravitational collapse deepens with increasing particle number $N$ but only slowly: 86% of triaxial configurations may collapse by a factor of no more than 40 as $N\to\infty$. For $N\approx 10^5$ and larger, violent relaxation develops fully under the Lin-Mestel-Shu instability such that numerical $N$-body solutions now resolve the different initial morphologies adequately.",0
"Using the properties of gauged N=4 supergravity, we show that it is possible to derive a universal thermal effective potential that describes all possible high-temperature instabilities of the known N=4 superstrings. These instabilities are due to non-perturbative dyonic modes, which become tachyonic in a region of the thermal moduli space M={s,t,u}; M is common to all non-perturbative dual-equivalent N=4 superstrings in five dimensions. We analyse the non-perturbative thermal potential and show the existence of a phase transition at high temperatures corresponding to a condensation of 5-branes. This phase is described in detail, using an effective non-critical string theory.",0
A new wavelet based technique for the perturbative solution of the Langevin equation is proposed. It is shown that for the random force acting in a limited band of scales the proposed method directly leads to a finite result with no renormalization required. The one-loop contribution to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation Green function for the interface growth is calculated as an example.,0
"The multiquark confining potential is proportional to the total distance of the fundamental strings linking the quarks and antiquarks. We address the computation of the total string distance an of the Fermat points where the different strings meet. For a meson (quark-antiquark system) the distance is trivially the quark-antiquark distance. For a baryon (three quark system) the problem was solved geometrically from the onset, by Fermat and by Torricelli. The geometrical solution can be determined just with a rule and a compass, but translation of the geometrical solution to an analytical expression is not as trivial. For tetraquarks, pentaquarks, hexaquarks, etc, the geometrical solution is much more complicated. Here we provide an iterative method, converging fast to the correct Fermat points and the total distances, relevant for the multiquark potentials. We also review briefly the geometrical methods leading to the Fermat points and to the total distances.",0
"(abridged) We present results of the disorder-induced metal-insulator-transition (MIT) in three-dimensional amorphous indium-oxide films. The amorphous version studied here differs from the one reported earlier [PRB 46, 10917 (1992)] in that it has a much lower carrier concentration. As a measure of the static disorder we use the dimensionless parameter kFl. Thermal annealing is employed as the experimental handle to tune the disorder. On the metallic side of the transition, the low temperature transport exhibits weak-localization and electron-electron correlation effects characteristic of disordered electronic systems. The MIT occurs at a kFl~0.3 for both versions of the amorphous material. However, in contrast with the results obtained on the electron-rich version of this system, no sign of superconductivity is seen down to ~0.3K even for the most metallic sample used in the current study. This demonstrates that using kFl as a disorder parameter for the superconductor-insulator-transition (SIT) is an ill defined procedure. A microstructural study of the films, employing high resolution chemical analysis, gives evidence for spatial fluctuations of the stoichiometry. This brings to light that, while the films are amorphous and show excellent uniformity in transport measurements of macroscopic samples, they contain compositional fluctuations that extend over mesoscopic scales. It is argued that this compositional disorder may be the reason for the apparent violation of the Ioffe-Regel criterion in the two versions of the amorphous indium-oxide. However, more dramatic effects due to this disorder are expected when superconductivity sets in, which are in fact consistent with the prominent transport anomalies observed in the electron-rich version of indium-oxide. The relevance of compositional disorder to other systems near their SIT is discussed.",0
"This work deals with the dynamics of inflation in the context of a scalar-vector-tensor theory of gravity exhibiting spontaneous Lorentz violation at early times. We describe a first-order formalism which we use to obtain new exact Lorentz violating inflationary solutions for a broad family of models, some in the absence of a potential for the inflaton field. Our results show that different conditions are required to solve the horizon and flatness problems. In particular, we find a necessary condition for inflation to provide a solution to both problems and we show that in inflationary models with no inflaton potential a period of superinflation might be necessary to solve the flatness problem.",0
"We investigate the importance of the far red wing of the Lyman $ \alpha$ line of hydrogen in the atmospheres of cool white dwarfs of pure hydrogen composition. We find that this absorption process dominates all important sources of opacity in the blue part of the optical spectrum of these stars. Our successful fits to the spectra of cool DA/DC white dwarfs indicate that the far red wing of the $\rm Ly \alpha$ line is the source of opacity that had been missing in the models. The observed sequence of cool white dwarfs in color-color diagrams is very well reproduced by our new pure hydrogen atmosphere models, suggesting that the atmospheric composition of the coolest DC white dwarfs must be revisited.",0
"We report a mechanical effect in spin-valve nanopillars due to spin transfer. A polarized current carrying electron spins transfers torque to local magnetization and leads to a magnetic switching of free layer. Like classical Einstein-de Haas effect, the conservation of angular momentum needs the free layer to offset the change of angular momentum and then a mechanical rotation occurs. The free layer is not free standing, so the mechanical angular momentum will be revealed as stress and strain. We study the effect of a spin induced stress in a nanopillar device with in-plane magnetization. Our calculations show that the tress in as device is dependent on frequency and the ratio of length/thickness and about 1 MPa at GHz. It is concluded that the stress owing to spin transfer is much less than the internal stress of film and does not introduce damage to the device.",0
"We consider various neutrino mixing matrix parametrizations and the dependence of the mixing angles and CP-violating phase on the different parametrizations. The transformations of neutrino mixing parameters between various parametrizations are presented. Although the $\theta_{13}$ mixing angle is determined to be small in the conventional parametrization, we note that in several other parametrizations the values of $\theta_{13}$ are quite large. Should the value of $\theta_{13}$ turn out to be tiny in the conventional parametrization, this study suggests that other alternative mixing matrix representations would be more suitable for dertermining the value of the CP-violating phase.",0
The Riemann-zeta function regularization procedure has been studied intensively as a good method in the computation of the determinant for pseudo-diferential operator. In this paper we propose a different approach for the computation of the determinant base on the Wheeler-De Witt equation.,0
"We show that a theory with conformal invariance, which is explicitly broken by small terms, provides a solution to the fine tuning problem of the cosmological constant. In the absence of the symmetry breaking terms, the cosmological constant is zero. Its value in the full theory is controlled by the symmetry breaking terms. The symmetry breaking terms also provide the slow roll conditions, which may be useful in constructing a model of inflation.",0
"We study various measures of classicality of the states of open quantum systems subject to decoherence. Classical states are expected to be stable in spite of decoherence, and are thought to leave conspicuous imprints on the environment. Here these expected features of environment-induced superselection (einselection) are quantified using four different criteria: predictability sieve (which selects states that produce least entropy), purification time (which looks for states that are the easiest to find out from the imprint they leave on the environment), efficiency threshold (which finds states that can be deduced from measurements on a smallest fraction of the environment), and purity loss time (that looks for states for which it takes the longest to lose a set fraction of their initial purity). We show that when pointer states -- the most predictable states of an open quantum system selected by the predictability sieve -- are well defined, all four criteria agree that they are indeed the most classical states. We illustrate this with two examples: an underdamped harmonic oscillator, for which coherent states are unanimously chosen by all criteria, and a free particle undergoing quantum Brownian motion, for which most criteria select almost identical Gaussian states (although, in this case, predictability sieve does not select well defined pointer states.)",0
"This paper studies rotational virtual knot theory and its relationship with quantum link invariants. Every quantum link invariant for classical knots and links extends to an invariant of rotational virtual knots and links. The paper sets up the background virtual knot theory, defines rotational virtual knot theory, studies an extension of the bracket polynomial and the Manturov parity bracket for rotationals. We give examples of links that are not detected by the bracket polynomial but are detected by the extended parity bracket. Then the general frameworks for oriented and unoriented quantum invariants are introduced and formulated for rotational virtual links. The paper ends with a section on quantum link invariants in the Hopf algebra framework where one can see the naturality of using regular homotopy combined with virtual crossings (permutation operators), as they occur significantly in the category associated with a Hopf algebra. We show how this approach via categories and quantum algebras illuminates the structure of invariants that we have already described via state summations. In particular, we show that a certain non-trivial link L has trivial functorial image. This means that this link is not detected by any quantum invariant formulated as outlined in this paper. We show earlier in the paper that the link L is a non-trivial rotational link using the parity bracket. These calculations with the diagrammatic images in quantum algebra show how this category forms a higher level language for understanding rotational virtual knots and links. There are inherent limitations to studying rotational virtual knots by quantum algebra alone.",0
"Multifunctional materials composed of ultrathin magnetic films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy combined with ferroelectric substrates represent a new approach toward low power, fast, high density spintronics. Here we demonstrate Co/Ni multilayered films with tunable saturation magnetization and perpendicular anisotropy grown directly on ferroelectric PZT [Pb(Zr_xTi_1-x)O_3] substrate plates. Electric fields up to +/- 2 MV/m expand the PZT by 0.1% and generate at least 0.02% in-plane compression in the Co/Ni multilayered film. Modifying the strain with a voltage can reduce the coercive field by over 30%. We also demonstrate that alternating in-plane tensile and compressive strains (less than 0.01%) can be used to propagate magnetic domain walls. This ability to manipulate high anisotropy magnetic thin films could prove useful for lowering the switching energy for magnetic elements in future voltage-controlled spintronic devices.",0
"Following navigation instructions in natural language requires a composition of language, action, and knowledge of the environment. Knowledge of the environment may be provided via visual sensors or as a symbolic world representation referred to as a map. Here we introduce the Realistic Urban Navigation (RUN) task, aimed at interpreting navigation instructions based on a real, dense, urban map. Using Amazon Mechanical Turk, we collected a dataset of 2515 instructions aligned with actual routes over three regions of Manhattan. We propose a strong baseline for the task and empirically investigate which aspects of the neural architecture are important for the RUN success. Our results empirically show that entity abstraction, attention over words and worlds, and a constantly updating world-state, significantly contribute to task accuracy.",0
"Firstly, we demonstrate that unusually large outer HI spiral arms observed in NGC 2915 can form in an extended gas disk embedded in a massive triaxial dark matter halo with slow figure rotation, through the strong gravitational torque of the rotating halo. Secondly, we show that the figure rotation of a triaxial dark matter halo can influence dynamical evolution of disk galaxies by using fully self-consistent numerical simulations. We particularly describe the formation processes of ``halo-triggered'' bars in thin galactic disks dominated by dark matter halos with figure rotation and discuss the origin of stellar bars in low luminosity, low surface brightness (LSB) disk galaxies. Thirdly, we provide several implications of the present numerical results in terms of triggering mechanism of starbursts in galaxies and stellar bar formation in high redshifts.",0
"An important metric of the performance of a quantum secret sharing scheme is its information rate. Beyond the fact that the information rate is upper bounded by one, very little is known in terms of bounds on the information rate of quantum secret sharing schemes. Further, not every scheme can be realized with rate one. In this paper we derive new upper bounds for the information rates of quantum secret sharing schemes. We show that there exist quantum access structures on $n$ players for which the information rate cannot be better than $O((\log_2 n)/n)$. These results are the quantum analogues of the bounds for classical secret sharing schemes proved by Csirmaz.",0
"This paper ties the line of work on algorithms that find an O(sqrt(log(n)))-approximation to the sparsest cut together with the line of work on algorithms that run in sub-quadratic time by using only single-commodity flows. We present an algorithm that simultaneously achieves both goals, finding an O(sqrt(log(n)/eps))-approximation using O(n^eps log^O(1) n) max-flows. The core of the algorithm is a stronger, algorithmic version of Arora et al.'s structure theorem, where we show that matching-chaining argument at the heart of their proof can be viewed as an algorithm that finds good augmenting paths in certain geometric multicommodity flow networks. By using that specialized algorithm in place of a black-box solver, we are able to solve those instances much more efficiently. We also show the cut-matching game framework can not achieve an approximation any better than Omega(log(n)/log log(n)) without re-routing flow.",0
"The Schatten-$p$ norm ($0<p<1$) has been widely used to replace the nuclear norm for better approximating the rank function. However, existing methods are either 1) not scalable for large scale problems due to relying on singular value decomposition (SVD) in every iteration, or 2) specific to some $p$ values, e.g., $1/2$, and $2/3$. In this paper, we show that for any $p$, $p_1$, and $p_2 >0$ satisfying $1/p=1/p_1+1/p_2$, there is an equivalence between the Schatten-$p$ norm of one matrix and the Schatten-$p_1$ and the Schatten-$p_2$ norms of its two factor matrices. We further extend the equivalence to multiple factor matrices and show that all the factor norms can be convex and smooth for any $p>0$. In contrast, the original Schatten-$p$ norm for $0<p<1$ is non-convex and non-smooth. As an example we conduct experiments on matrix completion. To utilize the convexity of the factor matrix norms, we adopt the accelerated proximal alternating linearized minimization algorithm and establish its sequence convergence. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets exhibit its superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods. Its speed is also highly competitive.",0
"We report on GROND observations of a 40 sec duration (rest-frame) optical flare from GRB 080129 at redshift 4.349. The rise- and decay time follow a power law with indices +12 and -8, respectively, inconsistent with a reverse shock and a factor 10$^5$ faster than variability caused by ISM interaction. While optical flares have been seen in the past (e.g. GRB 990123, 041219B, 060111B and 080319B), for the first time, our observations not only resolve the optical flare into sub-components, but also provide a spectral energy distribution from the optical to the near-infrared once every minute. The delay of the flare relative to the GRB, its spectral energy distribution as well as the ratio of pulse widths suggest it to arise from residual collisions in GRB outflows \cite{liw08}.If this interpretation is correct and can be supported by more detailed modelling or observation in further GRBs, the delay measurement provides an independent, determination of the Lorentz factor of the outflow.",0
"The Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack is a family of adversarial attack methods for fooling classification models, such as deep neural networks for image classification tasks. By saturating a few pixels in a given image to their maximum or minimum values, JSMA can cause the model to misclassify the resulting adversarial image as a specified erroneous target class. We propose two variants of JSMA, one which removes the requirement to specify a target class, and another that additionally does not need to specify whether to only increase or decrease pixel intensities. Our experiments highlight the competitive speeds and qualities of these variants when applied to datasets of hand-written digits and natural scenes.",0
"PCANet, as one noticeable shallow network, employs the histogram representation for feature pooling. However, there are three main problems about this kind of pooling method. First, the histogram-based pooling method binarizes the feature maps and leads to inevitable discriminative information loss. Second, it is difficult to effectively combine other visual cues into a compact representation, because the simple concatenation of various visual cues leads to feature representation inefficiency. Third, the dimensionality of histogram-based output grows exponentially with the number of feature maps used. In order to overcome these problems, we propose a novel shallow network model, named as PCANet-II. Compared with the histogram-based output, the second order pooling not only provides more discriminative information by preserving both the magnitude and sign of convolutional responses, but also dramatically reduces the size of output features. Thus we combine the second order statistical pooling method with the shallow network, i.e., PCANet. Moreover, it is easy to combine other discriminative and robust cues by using the second order pooling. So we introduce the binary feature difference encoding scheme into our PCANet-II to further improve robustness. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed PCANet-II method.",0
"A quantum system interacts with its environment, if ever so slightly, no matter how much care is put into isolating it. As a consequence, quantum bits (qubits) undergo errors, putting dauntingly difficult constraints on the hardware suitable for quantum computation. New strategies are emerging to circumvent this problem by encoding a qubit non-locally across the phase space of a physical system. Since most sources of decoherence are due to local fluctuations, the foundational promise is to exponentially suppress errors by increasing a measure of this non-locality. Prominent examples are topological qubits which delocalize quantum information over real space and where spatial extent measures non-locality. In this work, we encode a qubit in the field quadrature space of a superconducting resonator endowed with a special mechanism that dissipates photons in pairs. This process pins down two computational states to separate locations in phase space. As we increase this separation, we measure an exponential decrease of the bit-flip rate while only linearly increasing the phase-flip rate. Since bit-flips are continuously and autonomously corrected at the single qubit level, only phase-flips are left to be corrected via a one-dimensional quantum error correction code. This exponential scaling demonstrates that resonators with non-linear dissipation are promising building blocks for universal fault-tolerant quantum computation with drastically reduced hardware overhead.",0
"The generalization of the black hole in three-dimensional spacetime to include an electric charge Q in addition to the mass M and the angular momentum J is given. The field equations are first solved explicitly when Q is small and the general form of the field at large distances is established. The total ``hairs'' M, J and Q are exhibited as boundary terms at infinity. It is found that the inner horizon of the rotating uncharged black hole is unstable under the addition of a small electric charge. Next it is shown that when Q=0 the spinning black hole may be obtained from the one with J=0 by a Lorentz boost in the $\phi -t$ plane. This boost is an ``illegitimate coordinate transformation'' because it changes the physical parameters of the solution. The extreme black hole appears as the analog of a particle moving with the speed of light. The same boost may be used when $Q\neq 0$ to generate a solution with angular momentum from that with J=0, although the geometrical meaning of the transformation is much less transparent since in the charged case the black holes are not obtained by identifying points in anti-de Sitter space. The metric is given explicitly in terms of three parameters, $\widetilde{M}$, $ \widetilde{Q}$ and $\omega $ which are the ``rest mass'' and ``rest charge'' and the angular velocity of the boost. These parameters are related to M, J and Q through the solution of an algebraic cubic equation. Altogether, even without angular momentum, the electrically charged 2+1 black hole is somewhat pathological since (i) it exists for arbitrarily negative values of the mass, and (ii) there is no upper bound on the electric charge.",0
"A graph $G$ is well-covered if all maximal independent sets of $G$ have the same cardinality. In 1992 Topp and Volkmann investigated the structure of well-covered graphs that have nontrivial factorizations with respect to some of the standard graph products. In particular, they showed that both factors of a well-covered direct product are also well-covered and proved that the direct product of two complete graphs (respectively, two cycles) is well-covered precisely when they have the same order (respectively, both have order 3 or 4). Furthermore, they proved that the direct product of two well-covered graphs with independence number one-half their order is well-covered. We initiate a characterization of nontrivial, connected well-covered graphs $G$ and $H$, whose independence numbers are strictly less than one-half their orders, such that their direct product $G \times H$ is well-covered. In particular, we show that in this case both $G$ and $H$ have girth 3 and we present several infinite families of such well-covered direct products. Moreover, we show that if $G$ is a factor of any well-covered direct product, then $G$ is a complete graph unless it is possible to create an isolated vertex by removing the closed neighborhood of some independent set of vertices in $G$.",0
"The main purpose of this Note is to provide a non-trivial bound on certain Kloosterman sums as considered in the recent paper of E. Fouvry [F], leading to a small improvement of his result on the Pell equation.",0
"We present the first data release (DR1) of the SkyMapper Southern Survey, a hemispheric survey carried out with the SkyMapper Telescope at Siding Spring Observatory in Australia. Here, we present the survey strategy, data processing, catalogue construction and database schema. The DR1 dataset includes over 66,000 images from the Shallow Survey component, covering an area of 17,200 deg$^2$ in all six SkyMapper passbands $uvgriz$, while the full area covered by any passband exceeds 20,000 deg$^2$. The catalogues contain over 285 million unique astrophysical objects, complete to roughly 18 mag in all bands. We compare our $griz$ point-source photometry with PanSTARRS1 DR1 and note an RMS scatter of 2%. The internal reproducibility of SkyMapper photometry is on the order of 1%. Astrometric precision is better than 0.2 arcsec based on comparison with Gaia DR1. We describe the end-user database, through which data are presented to the world community, and provide some illustrative science queries.",0
"We analyze the fluctuating dynamics at the golden-mean transition to chaos in the critical circle map and find that trajectories within the critical attractor consist of infinite sets of power laws mixed together. We elucidate this structure assisted by known renormalization group (RG) results. Next we proceed to weigh the new findings against Tsallis' entropic and Mori's thermodynamic theoretical schemes and observe behavior to a large extent richer than previously reported. We find that the sensitivity to initial conditions has the form of families of intertwined q-exponentials, of which we determine the q-indexes and the generalized Lyapunov coefficient spectra. Further, the dynamics within the critical attractor is found to consist of not one but a collection of Mori's q-phase transitions with a hierarchical structure. The value of Mori's `thermodynamic field' variable q at each transition corresponds to the same special value for the entropic index q. We discuss the relationship between the two formalisms and indicate the usefulness of the methods involved to determine the universal trajectory scaling function and/or the ocurrence and characterization of dynamical phase transitions.",0
The structural properties of the $Zn_xMg_{1-xS_ySe_{1-y}}$ solid solutions are determined by a combination of the computational alchemy and the cluster expansion methods with Monte Carlo simulations. We determine the phase diagram of the alloy and show that the homogeneous phase is characterized by a large amount of short-range order occurring among first-nearest neighbors. Electronic-structure calculations performed using the special quasi-random structures approach indicate that the energy gap of the alloy is rather sensitive to this short-range order.,0
"In [{\it American J. Mathematics}, 124(2002), 107--127] we proved that for a germ of $C^\infty$ hyperbolic diffeomorphisms $F(x)=Ax+f(x)$ in $(\mathbb R^n,0)$, if $A$ has a real logarithm with its eigenvalues weakly nonresonant, then $F(x)$ can be embedded in a $C^\infty$ autonomous differential system. Its proof was very complicated, which involved the existence of embedding periodic vector field of $F(x)$ and the extension of the Floquet's theory to nonlinear $C^\infty$ periodic differential systems. In this paper we shall provide a simple and direct proof to this last result. Next we shall show that the weakly nonresonant condition in the last result on the real logarithm of $A$ is necessary for some $C^\infty$ diffeomorphisms $F(x)=Ax+f(x)$ to have $C^\infty$ embedding flows. Finally we shall prove that a germ of $C^\infty$ hyperbolic diffeomorphisms $F(x)=Ax+f(x)$ with $f(x)=O(|x|^2)$ in $(\mathbb R^2,0)$ has a $C^\infty$ embedding flow if and only if either $A$ has no negative eigenvalues or $A$ has two equal negative eigenvalues and it can be diagonalizable.",0
"We argue that the usual notions of thermodynamic and entanglement entropy have novel analogs in the context of higher spin theories. In particular, the Wald and Ryu-Takayanagi formulas have natural higher spin extensions that we work out and study. On the CFT side, just as standard entanglement entropy in CFT_2 can be computed from twist field correlators, we demonstrate that by introducing corresponding operators carrying higher spin charge we can precisely reproduce our results from the bulk. We also show that the first law for entanglement entropy implies the linearized field equations for the metric and higher spin fields, generalizing recent work on deriving the linearized Einstein equations from the first law.",0
"It is shown that, if isospin is not conserved in $a^0_0$- and $f_0$-meson mixing, forward-backward asymmetry arises in the reaction $pn\to da^0_0$. This effect increases near the reaction threshold. The asymmetry is estimated within the framework of a model in which the $a^0_0$-$f_0$ mixing is due to the virtual $\pi^0\leftrightarrow\eta$ transition and the difference in masses of the charged and neutral kaons in decay channels. The angular asymmetry near the threshold of the $pn\to da^0_0$ reaction was found to be large, of the order of $8\div 15$ %.",0
"A new equation of motion, which is derived previously by imposing Neumann boundary condition on cosmological perturbation equations (Shenavar 2016 a), is investigated. By studying the precession of perihelion, it is shown that the new equation of motion suggests a small, though detectable, correction in orbits of solar system objects. Then a system of particles is surveyed to have a better understanding of galactic structures. Also the general form of the force law is introduced by which the rotation curve and mass discrepancy of axisymmetric disks of stars are derived. In addition, it is suggested that the mass discrepancy as a function of centripetal acceleration becomes significant near a constant acceleration $ 2c_{1}a_{0} $ where $c_{1}$ is the Neumann constant and $ a_{0} = 6.59 \times 10^{-10} $ $m/s^{2}$ is a fundamental acceleration. Furthermore, it is shown that a critical surface density equal to $ \sigma_{0}=a_{0}/G $, in which G is the Newton gravitational constant, has a significant role in rotation curve and mass discrepancy plots. Also, the specific form of NFW mass density profile at small radii, $ \rho \propto 1/r $, is explained too. Finally, the present model will be tested by using a sample of 39 LSB galaxies for which we will show that the rotation curve fittings are generally acceptable. The derived mass to light ratios too are found within the plausible bound except for the galaxy F571-8.",0
"The famous """"two-fold cost of sex"""" is really the cost of anisogamy -- why should females mate with males who do not contribute resources to offspring, rather than isogamous partners who contribute equally? In typical anisogamous populations, a single very fit male can have an enormous number of offspring, far larger than is possible for any female or isogamous individual. If the sexual selection on males aligns with the natural selection on females, anisogamy thus allows much more rapid adaptation via super-successful males. We show via simulations that this effect can be sufficient to overcome the two-fold cost and maintain anisogamy against isogamy in populations adapting to environmental change. The key quantity is the variance in male fitness -- if this exceeds what is possible in an isogamous population, anisogamous populations can win out in direct competition by adapting faster.",0
"Fermi statistics is formally extended to the case when energy levels are allowed to be partially occupied, which the Pauli principle does not categorically exclude. The partial Fermi distribution obtained depends on the partial occupation of states but otherwise has similar properties as the (integer) Fermi distribution. In the zero temperature limit both are identical.",0
"Let $G_q$ be the $q$-deformation of a simply connected simple compact Lie group $G$ of type $A$, $C$ or $D$ and $\mathcal{O}_q(G)$ be the algebra of regular functions on $G_q$.

"There are difficulties in understanding what keeps the plasma thermalized in compact sources, especially during rapid variations of the emitted flux. Particle-particle collisions are too inefficient in hot rarefied plasmas, and a faster process is called for. Synchrotron absorption is such a process. We show that relativistic electrons can thermalize in a few synchrotron cooling times by emitting and absorbing cyclo-synchrotron photons. The resulting equilibrium distribution is a Maxwellian at low energies, with a high energy power law tail when Compton cooling is important. Assuming that the particles emit completely self absorbed synchrotron radiation while they at the same time Compton scatter ambient UV photons, we calculate the time dependent behavior of the distribution function, and the final high energy spectra.",0
"The problem of recovering the asymptotics of a short range perturbation of the Euclidean metric on R^n from fixed energy scattering data is studied. It is shown that if two such metrics, g1, g2, have scattering data at some fixed energy which are equal up to smoothing, then there exists a diffeomorphism \psi `fixing infinity' such that \psi^*(g1) - g2 is rapidly decreasing. Given the scattering matrix at two energies, it is shown that the asymptotics of a metric and a short range potential can be determined simultaneously. These results also hold for a wide class of scattering manifolds.",0
"We develop theory for nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR). A number of NLDR methods have been developed, but there is limited understanding of how these methods work and the relationships between them. There is limited basis for using existing NLDR theory for deriving new algorithms. We provide a novel framework for analysis of NLDR via a connection to the statistical theory of linear smoothers. This allows us to both understand existing methods and derive new ones. We use this connection to smoothing to show that asymptotically, existing NLDR methods correspond to discrete approximations of the solutions of sets of differential equations given a boundary condition. In particular, we can characterize many existing methods in terms of just three limiting differential operators and boundary conditions. Our theory also provides a way to assert that one method is preferable to another; indeed, we show Local Tangent Space Alignment is superior within a class of methods that assume a global coordinate chart defines an isometric embedding of the manifold.",0
"In order to stabilize Majorana excitations within vortices of proximity induced topological superconductors, it is mandatory that the Dirac point matches the Fermi level rather exactly, such that the conventionally confined states within the vortex are well separated from the Majorana-type excitation. Here, we show by angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy that (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$)$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ thin films with $x=0.94$ prepared by molecular beam epitaxy and transferred in ultrahigh vacuum from the molecular beam epitaxy system to the photoemission setup matches this condition. The Dirac point is within 10 meV around the Fermi level and we do not observe any bulk bands intersecting the Fermi level.",0
"We present an algorithm for the stochastic simulation of gene expression and heterogeneous population dynamics. The algorithm combines an exact method to simulate molecular-level fluctuations in single cells and a constant-number Monte Carlo method to simulate time-dependent statistical characteristics of growing cell populations. To benchmark performance, we compare simulation results with steadystate and time-dependent analytical solutions for several scenarios, including steadystate and time-dependent gene expression, and the effects on population heterogeneity of cell growth, division, and DNA replication. This comparison demonstrates that the algorithm provides an efficient and accurate approach to simulate how complex biological features influence gene expression. We also use the algorithm to model gene expression dynamics within """"bet-hedging"""" cell populations during their adaption to environmental stress. These simulations indicate that the algorithm provides a framework suitable for simulating and analyzing realistic models of heterogeneous population dynamics combining molecular-level stochastic reaction kinetics, relevant physiological details and phenotypic variability.",0
"One of the future instruments to resolve the origin of the unidentified 3.5 keV emission line is the Micro-X sounding rocket telescope. According to the estimate made in 2015, Micro-X will be able to detect on average about 18.2 photons from the 3.5 keV line during its 300-second-long planned observation. However, this estimate is based on the extrapolation of the 3.5 keV line signal from the innermost Galactic Centre (GC) region available in 2015. With newly available reports on the 3.5 keV line emission in five off-centre regions, we found that similar Micro-X payload will result in 3.4-4.3 counts on average, depending on the dark matter distribution. Therefore, we show that the 3.5 keV line is unlikely to be detected with a single Micro-X launch using an original Micro-X payload. Increasing its field-of-view from 20$^\circ$ to 33$^\circ$ and its repointing out of GC (to avoid the brightest X-ray point source on the sky, Sco X-1) will increase the expected number of counts from 3.5 keV line to 7.5-7.9, which corresponds to its expected marginal ($\sim 2\sigma$) detection within a single Micro-X observation.",0
"We explore linear redshift distortions in wide angle surveys from the point of view of symmetries. We show that the redshift space two-point correlation function can be expanded into tripolar spherical harmonics of zero total angular momentum $S_{l_1 l_2 l_3}(\hat x_1, \hat x_2, \hat x)$. The coefficients of the expansion $B_{l_1 l_2 l_3}$ are analogous to the $C_l$'s of the angular power spectrum, and express the anisotropy of the redshift space correlation function. Moreover, only a handful of $B_{l_1 l_2 l_3}$ are non-zero: the resulting formulae reveal a hidden simplicity comparable to distant observer limit. The $B_{l_1 l_2 l_3}$ depend on spherical Bessel moments of the power spectrum and $f = \Omega^{0.6}/b$. In the plane parallel limit, the results of \cite{Kaiser1987} and \cite{Hamilton1993} are recovered. The general formalism is used to derive useful new expressions. We present a particularly simple trigonometric polynomial expansion, which is arguably the most compact expression of wide angle redshift distortions. These formulae are suitable to inversion due to the orthogonality of the basis functions. An alternative Legendre polynomial expansion was obtained as well. This can be shown to be equivalent to the results of \cite{SzalayEtal1998}. The simplicity of the underlying theory will admit similar calculations for higher order statistics as well.",0
"Non-Gaussianity in the primordial fluctuations that seeded structure formation produces a signal in the galaxy power spectrum on very large scales. This signal contains vital information about the primordial Universe, but it is very challenging to extract, because of cosmic variance and large-scale systematics - especially after the Planck experiment has already ruled out a large amplitude for the signal. Cosmic variance and experimental systematics can be alleviated by the multi-tracer method. Here we address another systematic - introduced by not using the correct relativistic analysis of the power spectrum on very large scales. In order to reduce the errors on fNL, we need to include measurements on the largest possible scales. Failure to include the relativistic effects on these scales can introduce significant bias in the best-fit value of fNL from future galaxy surveys.",0
"0.5%, 1%, 3% and 5% Ce-concentration single crystals of Tl2LiLuCl6 were grown from the melt using two zone vertical Bridgman technique. X-ray induced emission spectra showed Ce3+ emission between 370 nm and 540 nm wavelength range. Energy resolution, light yield and decay time of the grown samples were measured under {\gamma}-ray excitation at room temperature. Energy resolution of 5.6% (FWHM) with 27,000+-2700 light yield is found for 1%Ce doped sample. For the same dopant concentration, three decay time components are also observed. Variation of scintillation properties is observed as a function of dopant concentration in this material.This material will provide excellent detection efficiency for X- and {\gamma}-rays due to its high effective Z-number and density. It is expected that this scintillor will be a potential detector for the medical imaging techniques.",0
"Small system sizes are a well known source of error in DFT calculations, yet computational constraints frequently dictate the use of small supercells, often as small as 96 atoms in oxides and compound semiconductors. In ionic compounds, electrostatic finite size effects have been well characterised, but self-interaction of charge neutral defects is often discounted or assumed to follow an asymptotic behaviour and thus easily corrected with linear elastic theory. Here we show that elastic effects are also important in the description of defects in ionic compounds and can lead to qualitatively incorrect conclusions if inadequately small supercells are used; moreover, the spurious self-interaction does not follow the behaviour predicted by linear elastic theory. Considering the exemplar cases of metal oxides with fluorite structure, we show that numerous previous studies, employing 96-atom supercells, misidentify the ground state structure of (charge neutral) Schottky defects. We show that the error is eliminated by employing larger cells (324, 768 and 1500 atoms), and careful analysis determines that elastic effects, not electrostatic, are responsible. The spurious self-interaction was also observed in non-oxide ionic compounds and irrespective of the computational method used, thereby resolving long standing discrepancies between DFT and force-field methods, previously attributed to the level of theory. The surprising magnitude of the elastic effects are a cautionary tale for defect calculations in ionic materials, particularly when employing computationally expensive methods or when modelling large defect clusters. We propose two computationally practicable methods to test the magnitude of the elastic self-interaction in any ionic system.",0
"We investigate the decays D^0 --> pi^- l^+ nu and D^0 --> K^- l^+ nu, where l = e or mu, using approximately 7 fb^{-1} of data collected with the CLEO III detector. We find R_0 = B(D->pienu)/B(D->Kenu) = 0.082 +- 0.006 +- 0.005. Fits to the kinematic distributions of the data provide parameters describing the form factor of each mode. Combining the form factor results and R_0 gives |f^pi_+(0)|^2 |V_{cd}|^2/|f^K_+(0)|^2 |V_{cs}|^2 = 0.038 +0.006- 0.007 +0.005-0.003.",0
"The spectral dynamics of a mid-infrared multimode Cr^2+:ZnSe laser located in a vacuum sealed chamber containing acetylene at low pressure is analyzed by a stepping-mode high-resolution time-resolved Fourier transform interferometer. Doppler-limited absorption spectra of C_2H_2 in natural isotopic abundance are recorded around 4000 cm^-1 with kilometric absorption path lengths and sensitivities better than 3 10^-8 cm-1. Two cold bands are newly identified and assigned to the n_1+n_4^1 and n_3+n_5^1 transitions of ^12C^13CH_2. The n_1+n_5^1 band of ^12C_2HD and fourteen ^12C_2H_2 bands are observed, among which for the first time n_2+2n_4^2+n_5^-1.",0
"Using Monte Carlo techniques, we show that the two--dimensional anisotropic Heisenberg model reproducing nicely inelastic neutron scattering measurements on La_5 Ca_9 Cu_24 O_41 (Matsuda et al.

Possible reasons for the discrepancy are suggested.",0
"In this paper, a new method is proposed to prove the superconvergence of both the Crouzeix-Raviart and Morley elements. The main idea is to fully employ equivalences with the first order Raviart-Thomas element and the first order Hellan-Herrmann-Johnson element, respectively. In this way, some special conformity of discrete stresses is explored and superconvergence of mixed elements can be used to analyze superconvergence of nonconforming elements. Finally, a half order superconvergence by postprocessing is proved for both nonconforming elements.",0
The transport properties of a quantum dot coupled to superconducting leads are analyzed. It is shown that the quasiparticle current in the Kondo regime is determined by the non-equilibrium dynamics of subgap states (Andreev states) under an applied voltage. The current at low bias is suppressed exponentially for decreasing Kondo temperature in agreement with recent experiments. We also predict novel interference effects due to multiple Landau-Zener transitions between Andreev states.,0
"The Monge-Ampere equation, plays a central role in the theory of fully non linear equations. In fact we will like to show how the Monge-Ampere equation, links in some way the ideas comming from the calculus of variations and those of the theory of fully non linear equations.",0
Spin transport properties at finite electric and magnetic fields are studied by using the generalized semiclassical Boltzmann equation. It is found that the spin diffusion equation for non-equilibrium spin density and spin currents involves a number of length scales that explicitly depend on the electric and magnetic fields. The set of macroscopic equations can be used to address a broad range of the spin transport problems in magnetic multilayers as well as in semiconductor heterostructure. A specific example of spin injection into semiconductors at arbitrary electric and magnetic fields is illustrated.,0
"Charge density waves are a common occurrence in all families of high critical temperature superconducting cuprates. Although consistently observed in the underdoped region of the phase diagram and at relatively low temperatures, it is still unclear to what extent they influence the unusual properties of these systems. Using resonant x-ray scattering we carefully determined the temperature dependence of charge density modulations in (Y,Nd)Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-{\delta}}$ for three doping levels. We discovered short-range dynamical charge density fluctuations besides the previously known quasi-critical charge density waves. They persist up to well above the pseudogap temperature T*, are characterized by energies of few meV and pervade a large area of the phase diagram, so that they can play a key role in shaping the peculiar normal-state properties of cuprates.",0
"Let $\Delta$ be a finite set of nonzero linear forms in several variables with coefficients in a field $\mathbf K$ of characteristic zero. Consider the $\mathbf K$-algebra $R(\Delta)$ of rational functions on V which are regular outside $\bigcup_{\alpha\in\Delta} \ker\alpha$. Then the ring $R(\Delta)$ is naturally doubly filtered by the degrees of denominators and of numerators. In this paper we give an explicit combinatorial formula for the Poincar\'e series in two variables of the associated bigraded vector space $\bar{R}(\Delta)$. This generalizes the main theorem of Terao, H.: Algebras generated by reciprocals of linear forms, to appear in J.Algebra (arXiv:math.CO/0105095).",0
"We investigate the structure of the wind in the neutron star X-ray binary system Vela X-1 by analyzing its flaring behavior. Vela X-1 shows constant flaring, with some flares reaching fluxes of more than 3.0 Crab between 20-60 keV for several 100 seconds, while the average flux is around 250 mCrab. We analyzed all archival INTEGRAL data, calculating the brightness distribution in the 20-60 keV band, which, as we show, closely follows a log-normal distribution. Orbital resolved analysis shows that the structure is strongly variable, explainable by shocks and a fluctuating accretion wake. Analysis of RXTE ASM data suggests a strong orbital change of N_H. Accreted clump masses derived from the INTEGRAL data are on the order of 5 x 10^19 -10^21 g. We show that the lightcurve can be described with a model of multiplicative random numbers. In the course of the simulation we calculate the power spectral density of the system in the 20-100 keV energy band and show that it follows a red-noise power law. We suggest that a mixture of a clumpy wind, shocks, and turbulence can explain the measured mass distribution. As the recently discovered class of supergiant fast X-ray transients (SFXT) seems to show the same parameters for the wind, the link between persistent HMXB like Vela X-1 and SFXT is further strengthened.",0
"The first results of a new three-dimensional, finite temperature Skyrme-Hartree-Fock+BCS study of the properties of inhomogeneous nuclear matter at densities and temperatures leading to the transition to uniform nuclear matter are presented. Calculations are carried out in a cubic box representing a unit cell of the locally periodic structure of the matter. A constraint is placed on the two independent components of the quadrupole moment of the neutron density in order to investigate the dependence of the total energy-density of matter on the geometry of the nuclear structure in the unit cell. This approach allows self-consistent modeling of effects such as (i) neutron drip, resulting in a neutron gas external to the nuclear structure, (ii) shell effects of bound and unbound nucleons, (iii) the variety of exotic nuclear shapes that emerge, collectively termed `nuclear pasta' and (iv) the dissolution of these structures into uniform nuclear matter as density and/or temperature increase. In part I of this work the calculation of the properties of inhomogeneous nuclear matter in the core collapse of massive stars is reported. Calculations are performed at baryon number densities of $n_{\rm b}$ = 0.04 - 0.12 fm$^{\rm -3}$, a proton fraction of $y_{\rm p}=0.3$ and temperatures in the range 0 - 7.5 MeV. A wide variety of nuclear shapes are shown to emerge. It is suggested that thermodynamical properties change smoothly in the pasta regime up to the transition to uniform matter; at that transition, thermodynamic properties of the matter vary discontinuously.",0
"Let $V$ denote a vector space with finite positive dimension. We consider an ordered pair of linear transformations $A: V\rightarrow V$ and $A^{*}: V\rightarrow V$ that satisfy (i) and (ii) below. (i) There exists a basis for $V$ with respect to which the matrix representing $A$ is irreducible tridiagonal and the matrix representing $A^{*}$ is diagonal. (ii) There exists a basis for $V$ with respect to which the matrix representing $A^{*}$ is irreducible tridiagonal and the matrix representing $A$ is diagonal. We call such a pair a Leonard pair on $V$. In the literature, there are some parameters that are used to describe Leonard pairs called the intersection numbers $\{a_{i}\}_{i=0}^{d}$, $\{b_{i}\}_{i=0}^{d-1}$, $\{c_{i}\}_{i=1}^{d}$, and the dual eigenvalues $\{\theta^{*}_{i}\}_{i=0}^{d}$. In this paper, we provide two characterizations of Leonard pairs. For the first characterization, the focus is on the $\{a_{i}\}_{i=0}^{d}$ and $\{\theta^{*}_{i}\}_{i=0}^{d}$. For the second characterization, the focus is on the $\{b_{i}\}_{i=0}^{d-1}$, $\{c_{i}\}_{i=1}^{d}$, and $\{\theta^{*}_{i}\}_{i=0}^{d}$.",0
"Wishart ensembles of random matrix theory have been useful in modeling positive definite matrices encountered in classical and quantum chaotic systems. We consider nonzero means for the entries of the constituting matrix A which defines the correlated Wishart matrix as W = AA{\dag}, and refer to the ensemble of such Wishart matrices as the non-central correlated Wishart ensemble (nc-CWE). We derive the Pastur self-consistent equation which describes the spectral density of nc-CWE at large matrix dimension.",0
"We present a stellar populations analysis of the first release of the CFHTLS (Canada-France-Hawai Telescope Legacy Survey) data. A detailed comparison between the Besan\c{c}on model of the Galaxy and the first data release of the CFHTLS-Deep survey is performed by implementing the MEGACAM photometric system in this model using stellar atmosphere model libraries. The reliability of the theoretical libraries to reproduce the observed colours in the MEGACAM system is investigated. The locations of various stellar species like subdwarfs, white dwarfs, late-type and brown dwarfs, binary systems are identified. The contamination of the stellar sample by quasars and compact galaxies is quantified using spectroscopic data from the VIMOS-VLT Deep Survey (VVDS) as a function of $i'$ magnitude and $r'-i'$ colour. A comparison between simulated counts using the standard IMF at low masses show that the number of very low mass dwarfs may have been underestimated in previous studies. These observations favour a power law IMF following $d(n)/dm \propto m^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha=2.5$ for $m < $ 0.25 \Msun or $\alpha=3.0$ for $m < $ 0.2 \Msun for single stars. The resulting LF is in agreement with the local LF as measured from the 5 or 25 pc samples. It is in strong disagreement with the Zheng et al (2001) LF measured from deep HST data. We show that this discrepancy can be understood as an indication of a different IMF at low masses at early epochs of the Galaxy compared to the local thin disc IMF.",0
"We investigate the shell structure of bubble nuclei in simple phenomenological shell models and study their binding energy as a function of the radii and of the number of neutron and protons using Strutinsky's method. Shell effects come about, on the one hand, by the high degeneracy of levels with large angular momentum and, on the other, by the big energy gaps between states with a different number of radial nodes. Shell energies down to -40 MeV are shown to occur for certain magic nuclei. Estimates demonstrate that the calculated shell effects for certain magic numbers of constituents are probably large enough to produce stability against fission, alpha-, and beta-decay. No bubble solutions are found for mass number A < 450.",0
"The origin of Ultraluminous X-ray Sources (ULXs) in external galaxies whose X-ray luminosities exceed those of the brightest black holes in our Galaxy by hundreds and thousands of times is mysterious. The most popular models for the ULXs involve either intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) or stellar-mass black holes accreting at super-Eddington rates. Here we review the ULX properties. Their X-ray spectra indicate a presence of hot winds in their accretion disks supposing the supercritical accretion. In recent years, new surprising results were discovered in X-ray data, ULX-pulsars and high-velocity outflows up to 0.2 c. They are also in accordance with the super-Eddington accretion. However, the strongest evidences come from optical spectroscopy. The spectra of the ULX counterparts are very similar to that of SS433, the only known supercritical accretor in our Galaxy. The spectra are apparently of WNL type (late nitrogen Wolf-Rayet stars) or LBV (luminous blue variables) in their hot state, which are very scarce stellar objects. We find that the spectra do not originate from WNL/LBV type donors but from very hot winds from the accretion disks, which have similar physical conditions as the stellar winds from these stars. The results suggest that bona-fide ULXs must constitute a homogeneous class of objects, which most likely have supercritical accretion disks.",0
"We calculate the stochastic upper bounds for the Lorenz equations using an extension of the background method. In analogy with Rayleigh-B\'enard convection the upper bounds are for heat transport versus Rayleigh number. As might be expected, the stochastic upper bounds are larger than the deterministic counterpart of \citet{Doering15}, but their variation with noise amplitude exhibits interesting behavior. Below the transition to chaotic dynamics the upper bounds increase monotonically with noise amplitude. However, in the chaotic regime this monotonicity depends on the number of realizations in the ensemble; at a particular Rayleigh number the bound may increase or decrease with noise amplitude. The origin of this behavior is the coupling between the noise and unstable periodic orbits, the degree of which depends on the degree to which the ensemble represents the ergodic set. This is confirmed by examining the close returns plots of the full solutions to the stochastic equations and the numerical convergence of the noise correlations. The numerical convergence of both the ensemble and time averages of the noise correlations is sufficiently slow that it is the limiting aspect of the realization of these bounds. Finally, we note that the full solutions of the stochastic equations demonstrate that the effect of noise is equivalent to the effect of chaos.",0
"We consider the possibility of new physics giving rise to effective interactions of the form $e^+e^-Hf \bar f$, where $f$ represents a charged lepton $\ell$ or a (light) quark $q$, and $H$ the recently discovered Higgs boson. Such vertices would give contributions beyond the standard model to the Higgs production processes $e^+e^- \to H\ell^+\ell^-$ and $e^+e^- \to H q \bar q$ at a future $e^+e^-$ collider. We write the most general form for these vertices allowed by Lorentz symmetry. Assuming that such interactions contribute in addition to the standard model production processes, where the final-state fermion pair comes from the decay of the $Z$ boson, we obtain the differential cross section for the processes $e^+e^- \to H\ell^+\ell^-$ and $e^+e^- \to Hq\bar q$ to linear order in the effective interactions. We propose several observables with differing CP and T properties which, if measured, can be used to constrain the couplings occurring in interaction vertices. We derive possible limits on these couplings that may be obtained at a collider with centre-of-mass energy of 500 GeV and an integrated luminosity of 500 fb$^{-1}$. We also carry out the analysis assuming that both the electron and positron beams can be longitudinally polarized, and find that the sensitivity to the couplings can be improved by a factor of 2-4 by a specific choice of the signs of the polarizations of both the electron and positron beams for the same integrated luminosity.",0
"Understanding the effects of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and many-body interactions on spin transport is important in condensed matter physics and spintronics. This topic has been intensively studied for spin carriers such as electrons but barely explored for charge-neutral bosonic quasiparticles (including their condensates), which hold promises for coherent spin transport over macroscopic distances. Here, we explore the effects of synthetic SOC (induced by optical Raman coupling) and atomic interactions on the spin transport in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), where the spin-dipole mode (SDM, actuated by quenching the Raman coupling) of two interacting spin components constitutes an alternating spin current. We experimentally observe that SOC significantly enhances the SDM damping while reducing the thermalization (the reduction of the condensate fraction). We also observe generation of BEC collective excitations such as shape oscillations. Our theory reveals that the SOC-modified interference, immiscibility, and interaction between the spin components can play crucial roles in spin transport.",0
"We present a half-life formalism for describing the disruption of gravitationally-bound few-body systems, with a focus on binary-binary scattering. For negative total encounter energies, the four-body problem has three possible decay products in the point particle limit. For each decay product and a given set of initial conditions, we obtain directly from numerical scattering simulations the half-life for the distribution of disruption times. As in radioactive decay, the half-lives should provide a direct prediction for the relative fractions of each decay product. We test this prediction with simulated data and find good agreement with our hypothesis. We briefly discuss applications of this feature of the gravitational four-body problem to populations of black holes in globular clusters. This paper, the second in the series, builds on extending the remarkable similarity between gravitational chaos at the macroscopic scale and radioactive decay at the microscopic scale to larger-N systems.",0
"We describe a system that simplifies the process of debugging programs produced by computer-aided parallelization tools. The system uses relative debugging techniques to compare serial and parallel executions in order to show where the computations begin to differ. If the original serial code is correct, errors due to parallelization will be isolated by the comparison. One of the primary goals of the system is to minimize the effort required of the user. To that end, the debugging system uses information produced by the parallelization tool to drive the comparison process. In particular, the debugging system relies on the parallelization tool to provide information about where variables may have been modified and how arrays are distributed across multiple processes. User effort is also reduced through the use of dynamic instrumentation. This allows us to modify the program execution without changing the way the user builds the executable. The use of dynamic instrumentation also permits us to compare the executions in a fine-grained fashion and only involve the debugger when a difference has been detected. This reduces the overhead of executing instrumentation.",0
"In a previous paper we defined a class of non-compact polygonal billiards, the infinite step billiards: to a given decreasing sequence of non-negative numbers $\{p_{n}$, there corresponds a table $\Bi := \bigcup_{n\in\N} [n,n+1] \times [0,p_{n}]$. In this article, first we generalize the main result of the previous paper to a wider class of examples. That is, a.s. there is a unique escape orbit which belongs to the alpha and omega-limit of every other trajectory. Then, following a recent work of Troubetzkoy, we prove that generically these systems are ergodic for almost all initial velocities, and the entropy with respect to a wide class of ergodic measures is zero.",0
"The relationship between dust polarization and extinction was determined for the cold dense starless molecular cloud core FeSt 1-457 based on the background star polarimetry of dichroic extinction at near-infrared wavelengths. Owing to the known (three-dimensional) magnetic field structure, the observed polarizations from the core were corrected by considering (a) the subtraction of the ambient polarization component, (b) the depolarization effect of inclined distorted magnetic fields, and (c) the magnetic inclination angle of the core. After these corrections, a linear relationship between polarization and extinction was obtained for the core in the range up to $A_V \approx 20$ mag. The initial polarization vs. extinction diagram changed dramatically after the corrections of (a) to (c), with the correlation coefficient being refined from 0.71 to 0.79. These corrections should affect the theoretical interpretation of the observational data. The slope of the finally obtained polarization--extinction relationship is $P_H / E_{H-K_s} = 11.00 \pm 0.72$ $\%$ ${\rm mag}^{-1}$, which is close to the statistically estimated upper limit of the interstellar polarization efficiency (Jones 1989). This consistency suggests that the upper limit of interstellar polarization efficiency might be determined by the observational viewing angle toward polarized astronomical objects.",0
"Double parton scattering, i.e. two parton hard scattering processes in the same hadron-hadron collision, may constitute an important background for Higgs and other new particle searches at the LHC. We point out that like-sign W pair production provides a relatively clean way of searching for, and calibrating, double parton scattering at the LHC.",0
"We present results for the kaon mixing parameter $B_K$ obtained using improved staggered fermions on a much enlarged set of MILC asqtad lattices. Compared to our previous publication, which was based largely on a single ensemble at each of the three lattice spacings $a\approx 0.09\;$fm, $0.06\;$fm and $0.045\;$fm, we have added seven new fine and four new superfine ensembles, with a range of values of the light and strange sea-quark masses. We have also increased the number of measurements on one of the original ensembles. This allows us to do controlled extrapolations in the light and strange sea-quark masses, which we do simultaneously with the continuum extrapolation. This reduces the extrapolation error and improves the reliability of our error estimates. Our final result is $\hat{B}_K = 0.7379 \pm 0.0047 (\text{stat}) \pm 0.0365 (\text{sys})$.",0

"Motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) use an individuals ability to volitionally modulate localized brain activity as a therapy for motor dysfunction or to probe causal relations between brain activity and behavior. However, many individuals cannot learn to successfully modulate their brain activity, greatly limiting the efficacy of BCI for therapy and for basic scientific inquiry. Previous research suggests that coherent activity across diverse cognitive systems is a hallmark of individuals who can successfully learn to control the BCI. However, little is known about how these distributed networks interact through time to support learning. Here, we address this gap in knowledge by constructing and applying a multimodal network approach to decipher brain-behavior relations in motor imagery-based brain-computer interface learning using MEG. Specifically, we employ a minimally constrained matrix decomposition method (non-negative matrix factorization) to simultaneously identify regularized, covarying subgraphs of functional connectivity, to assess their similarity to task performance, and to detect their time-varying expression. Individuals also displayed marked variation in the spatial properties of subgraphs such as the connectivity between the frontal lobe and the rest of the brain, and in the temporal properties of subgraphs such as the stage of learning at which they reached maximum expression. From these observations, we posit a conceptual model in which certain subgraphs support learning by modulating brain activity in regions important for sustaining attention. To test this model, we use tools that stipulate regional dynamics on a networked system (network control theory), and find that good learners display a single subgraph whose temporal expression tracked performance and whose architecture supports easy modulation of brain regions important for attention.",0
"The FLAIR Shapley-Hydra (FLASH) redshift survey catalogue consists of 4613 galaxies brighter than $\bJ = 16.7$ (corrected for Galactic extinction) over a 605 sq. degree region of sky in the general direction of the Local Group motion. The survey region is an approximately $60\degr \times 10\degr$ strip spanning the sky from the Shapley Supercluster to the Hydra cluster, and contains 3141 galaxies with measured redshifts. Designed to explore the effect of the galaxy concentrations in this direction (in particular the Supergalactic plane and the Shapley Supercluster) upon the Local Group motion, the 68% completeness allows us to sample the large-scale structure better than similar sparsely-sampled surveys. The survey region does not overlap with the areas covered by ongoing wide-angle (Sloan or 2dF) complete redshift surveys. In this paper, the first in a series, we describe the observation and data reduction procedures, the analysis for the redshift errors and survey completeness, and present the survey data.",0
"In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have received significant attention from the research community. With a straightforward implementation and outstanding results, GANs have been used for numerous applications. Despite the success, GANs lack a proper theoretical explanation. These models suffer from issues like mode collapse, non-convergence, and instability during training. To address these issues, researchers have proposed theoretically rigorous frameworks inspired by varied fields of Game theory, Statistical theory, Dynamical systems, etc. In this paper, we propose to give an appropriate structure to study these contributions systematically. We essentially categorize the papers based on the issues they raise and the kind of novelty they introduce to address them. Besides, we provide insight into how each of the discussed articles solves the concerned problems. We compare and contrast different results and put forth a summary of theoretical contributions about GANs with focus on image/visual applications. We expect this summary paper to give a bird's eye view to a person wishing to understand the theoretical progress in GANs so far.",0
"Nuclear Astrophysics is a vibrant field at the intersection of nuclear physics and astrophysics that encompasses research in nuclear physics, astrophysics, astronomy, and computational science.

"The main properties and methods of describing dipolar and spinor atomic systems, composed of bosonic atoms or molecules, are reviewed. The general approach for the correct treatment of Bose-condensed atomic systems with nonlocal interaction potentials is explained. The approach is applied to Bose-condensed systems with dipolar interaction potentials. The properties of systems with spinor interaction potentials are described. Trapped atoms and atoms in optical lattices are considered. Effective spin Hamiltonians for atoms in optical lattices are derived. The possibility of spintronics with cold atom is emphasized. The present review differs from the previous review articles by concentrating on a thorough presentation of basic theoretical points, helping the reader to better follow mathematical details and to make clearer physical conclusions.",0
"It is almost 80 years since Hans Bethe described the level density as a non-interacting gas of protons and neutrons. In all these years, experimental data were interpreted within this picture of a fermionic gas. However, the renewed interest of measuring level density using various techniques calls for a revision of this description. In particular, the wealth of nuclear level densities measured with the Oslo method favors the constant-temperature level density over the Fermi-gas picture. From the basis of experimental data, we demonstrate that nuclei exhibit a constant-temperature level density behavior for all mass regions and at least up to the neutron threshold.",0
"We present observations of XRF 050406, the first burst detected by Swift showing a flare in its X-ray light curve. During this flare, which peaks at t_peak ~210s after the BAT trigger, a flux variation of (delta F)/F~6 in a very short time (delta t)/t_peak<<1 was observed. Its measured fluence in the 0.2-10 keV band was ~1.4x10^-8 erg cm^-2, which corresponds to 1-15% of the prompt fluence. We present indications of spectral variations during the flare. We argue that the producing mechanism is late internal shocks, which implies that the central engine is still active at 210s, though with a reduced power with respect to the prompt emission. The X-ray light curve flattens to a very shallow slope with decay index of ~0.5 after ~4400s, which also supports continued central engine activity at late times. This burst is classified as an X-ray flash, with a relatively low fluence (~10^-7 erg cm^-2 in the 15-350 keV band, E_iso~10^51 erg), a soft spectrum (photon index 2.65), no significant flux above ~50 keV and a peak energy E_p<15 keV. XRF 050406 is one of the first examples of a well-studied X-ray light curve of an XRF. We show that the main afterglow characteristics are qualitatively similar to those of normal GRBs. In particular, X-ray flares superimposed on a power-law light curve have now been seen in both XRFs and GRBs. This indicates that a similar mechanism may be at work for both kinds of events.",0
The apparent attenuation of muon neutrinos relative to electron neutrinos is a bit too low to be compatible with the most popular values of $\Delta m^{2}$. Fits to $R(E_{\nu})$ favor values of $\Delta m^{2}>0.1$ eV$^{2}$. The fit minimized by the Super Kamioka group in estimating neutrino oscillation parameters neglects systematic errors. The fit is dominated by systematic effects. The data being combined in recent fits may not be compatible since there appear to be significant variations in the properties of the data with time. A simple two component neutrino oscillation with $\Delta m^{2}$ in the range of 10$^{-3}$ to 10$^{-2}$ eV$^{2}$ seems unable to account for the observations.,0
"We present a study of the decay tau- -> K_S pi- nu_tau using a 351 fb^-1 data sample collected with the Belle detector. The analysis is based on 53110 lepton-tagged signal events. The measured branching fraction B(tau- -> K_S pi- nu_tau)=(0.404 +- 0.002(stat.) +- 0.013(syst.))% is consistent with the world average value and has better accuracy. An analysis of the K_S pi- invariant mass spectrum reveals contributions from the K*(892)- as well as other states. For the first time the K*(892)- mass and width have been measured in tau decay: M(K*(892)-)=(895.47 +- 0.20(stat.) +- 0.44(syst.) +- 0.59(mod.)) MeV/c2, Gamma(K*(892)-)=(46.2 +- 0.6(stat.) +- 1.0(syst.) +- 0.7(mod.)) MeV. The K*(892)- mass is significantly different from the current world average value.",0
"Inspired by the recent conjecture that black holes are condensates of gravitons, we investigate a simple model for the black hole degrees of freedom that is consistent both from the point of view of Quantum mechanics and of General Relativity. Since the two perspectives should """"converge"""" into a unified picture for small, Planck size, objects, we expect our construction is a useful step for understanding the physics of microscopic, quantum black holes. In particular, we show that a harmonically trapped condensate gives rise to two horizons, whereas the extremal case (corresponding to a remnant with vanishing Hawking temperature) naturally falls out of its spectrum.",0
"Interpretations of key concepts, such as uncertainty relations, kinetic energy, value of an observable, probability distributions, the projection or collapse of a wave function postulate, and discrete versus continuous values, that appear in several excellent textbooks on quantum mechanics are reviewed and found not to be consistent with our current understanding of quantum theory. Possible alternatives are suggested.",0
"With the advancement in the automation industry, to perform complex remote operations is required. Advancements in the networking technology has led to the development of different architectures to implement control from a large distance. In various control applications of the modern industry, the agents, such as sensors, actuators, and controllers are basically geographically distributed. For efficient working of a control application, all of the agents have to exchange information through a communication media. At present, an increasing number of distributed control systems are based on platforms made up of conventional PCs running open-source real-time operating systems. Often, these systems needed to have networked devices supporting synchronized operations with respect to each node. A framework is studied that relies on standard software and protocol as RTAI, EtherCAT, RTnet and IEEE 1588. RTAI and its various protocols are studied in network control systems environment.",0
"We show that there exists $k \in \bbn$ and $0 < \e \in\bbr$ such that for every field $F$ of characteristic zero and for every $n \in \bbn$, there exists explicitly given linear transformations $T_1,..., T_k: F^n \to F^n$ satisfying the following: For every subspace $W$ of $F^n$ of dimension less or equal $\frac n2$, $ \dim(W+\suml^k_{i=1} T_iW) \ge (1+\e) \dim W$. This answers a question of Avi Wigderson [W]. The case of fields of positive characteristic (and in particular finite fields) is left open.",0
A surface which does not admit a length nonincreasing deformation is called metric minimizing. We show that metric minimizing surfaces in CAT(0) spaces are locally CAT(0) with respect to their intrinsic metric.,0
"Extended $f(R)$ theories of gravity have been investigated from the symmetry point of view. We briefly has been investigated Noether symmetry of two types of extended $f(R)$ theories: $f(R,T)$ theory, in which curvature is coupled non minimally to the trace of energy momentum tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ and mimetic $f (R) $ gravity, a theory with a scalar field degree of freedom, but ghost-free and with internal conformal symmetry. In both cases we write point -like Lagrangian for flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmological background in the presence of ordinary matter. We have been shown that some classes of models existed with Noether symmetry in these viable extensions of $f(R)$ gravity. As a motivated idea, we have been investigating the stability of the solutions and the bouncing and $\Lambda$CDM models using the Noether symmetries. We have been shown that in mimetic $f(R)$ gravity bouncing and $\Lambda$CDM solutions are possible. Also a class of solutions with future singularities has been investigated.",0
"Bose-Einstein condensates of exciton-polaritons are described by a Schr\""""odinger system of two equations. Nonlinearity due to exciton interactions gives rise to a frequency band of dark soliton solutions, which are found analytically for the lossless zero-velocity case. The soliton's far-field value varies from zero to infinity as the operating frequency varies across the band. For positive detuning (photon frequency higher than exciton frequency), the exciton wavefunction becomes discontinuous when the operating frequency exceeds the exciton frequency. This phenomenon lies outside the parameter regime of validity of the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) model. Within its regime of validity, we give a derivation of a single-mode GP model from the initial Schr\""""odinger system and compare the continuous polariton solitons and GP solitons using the healing length notion.",0
"Random Matrix Theory (RMT) is applied to analyze weight matrices of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), including both production quality, pre-trained models such as AlexNet and Inception, and smaller models trained from scratch, such as LeNet5 and a miniature-AlexNet. Empirical and theoretical results clearly indicate that the DNN training process itself implicitly implements a form of Self-Regularization. The empirical spectral density (ESD) of DNN layer matrices displays signatures of traditionally-regularized statistical models, even in the absence of exogenously specifying traditional forms of explicit regularization. Building on relatively recent results in RMT, most notably its extension to Universality classes of Heavy-Tailed matrices, we develop a theory to identify 5+1 Phases of Training, corresponding to increasing amounts of Implicit Self-Regularization. These phases can be observed during the training process as well as in the final learned DNNs. For smaller and/or older DNNs, this Implicit Self-Regularization is like traditional Tikhonov regularization, in that there is a """"size scale"""" separating signal from noise. For state-of-the-art DNNs, however, we identify a novel form of Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization, similar to the self-organization seen in the statistical physics of disordered systems. This results from correlations arising at all size scales, which arises implicitly due to the training process itself. This implicit Self-Regularization can depend strongly on the many knobs of the training process. By exploiting the generalization gap phenomena, we demonstrate that we can cause a small model to exhibit all 5+1 phases of training simply by changing the batch size. This demonstrates that---all else being equal---DNN optimization with larger batch sizes leads to less-well implicitly-regularized models, and it provides an explanation for the generalization gap phenomena.",0
"n-Ising spins on a random surface represented by a matrix model is studied as a model of the 2D gravity coupled to matter field with the central charge c > 1. The magnetic field is introduced to discuss the scaling exponent $\Delta$, and the value of this magnetic field exponent is estimated by the series expansion.",0
Generating gaugino masses at the leading order has typically been difficult in direct/semi-direct gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking models. The Komargodski-Shih theorem has established that local stability of the supersymmetry breaking vacuum implies a vanishing leading order gaugino mass in generic renormalizable O'Raifeartaigh models. We relax the condition of renormalizability and investigate the possibility to evade the KS no-go theorem using higher dimensional operators in the Kahler potential and the superpotential. We demonstrate that higher dimensional terms which are polynomial in superfields are not adequate to evade the KS theorem. We narrow down on the possible class of non-polynomial corrections that can induce unsuppressed gaugino mass in a global supersymmetry breaking vacuum. We find that these models are tantalizingly close to the theories obtained from strongly coupled supersymmetry breaking schemes.,0
"A plausible consequence of rugged energy landscapes of biomolecules is that functionally competent folded states may not be unique, as is generally assumed. Indeed, molecule-to-molecule variations in the dynamics of enzymes and ribozymes under folding conditions have recently been identified in single molecule experiments. However, systematic quantification and the structural origin of the observed complex behavior remain elusive. Even for a relatively simple case of isomerization dynamics in Holliday Junctions (HJs), molecular heterogeneities persist over a long observation time (Tobs ~ 40 sec). Here, using concepts in glass physics and complementary clustering analysis, we provide a quantitative method to analyze the smFRET data probing the isomerization in HJ dynamics. We show that ergodicity of HJ dynamics is effectively broken; as a result, the conformational space of HJs is partitioned into a folding network of kinetically disconnected clusters. While isomerization dynamics in each cluster occurs rapidly as if the associated conformational space is fully sampled, distinct patterns of time series belonging to different clusters do not interconvert on Tobs. Theory suggests that persistent heterogeneity of HJ dynamics is a consequence of internal multiloops with varying sizes and flexibilities frozen by Mg2+ ions. An annealing experiment using Mg2+ pulse that changes the Mg2+ cocentration from high to low to high values lends support to this idea by explicitly showing that interconversions can be driven among trajectories with different patterns.",0
"The last 20 years have seen an explosion in our understanding of the large-scale distribution and motions of galaxies in the nearby universe. The field has moved from a largely qualitative, morphological description of the structures seen in the galaxy distribution, to a rich and increasingly rigorous statistical description, which allows us to constrain cosmological models. New surveys just now getting underway will be unprecedented in their uniformity and volume surveyed. The study of the evolution of large-scale structure with time is now becoming feasible.",0
The recent progress in the localized covariant density functional constrained by the relativistic Hartree-Fock theory is briefly presented by taking the Gamow-Teller resonance in 90Zr as an example. It is shown that the constraints introduced by the Fock terms into the particle-hole residual interactions are straight forward and robust.,0
"In this paper, we are interested in pose estimation of animals. Animals usually exhibit a wide range of variations on poses and there is no available animal pose dataset for training and testing. To address this problem, we build an animal pose dataset to facilitate training and evaluation. Considering the heavy labor needed to label dataset and it is impossible to label data for all concerned animal species, we, therefore, proposed a novel cross-domain adaptation method to transform the animal pose knowledge from labeled animal classes to unlabeled animal classes. We use the modest animal pose dataset to adapt learned knowledge to multiple animals species. Moreover, humans also share skeleton similarities with some animals (especially four-footed mammals). Therefore, the easily available human pose dataset, which is of a much larger scale than our labeled animal dataset, provides important prior knowledge to boost up the performance on animal pose estimation. Experiments show that our proposed method leverages these pieces of prior knowledge well and achieves convincing results on animal pose estimation.",0
"The double-periodic solutions of the focusing nonlinear Schrodinger equation have been previously obtained by the method of separation of variables. We construct these solutions by using an algebraic method with two eigenvalues. Furthermore, we characterize the Lax spectrum for the double-periodic solutions and analyze rogue waves arising on their background. Magnification of the rogue waves is studied numerically.",0
"This paper presents a study on multiple-antenna interference channels, accounting for general overhead as a function of the number of users and antennas in the network. The model includes both perfect and imperfect channel state information based on channel estimation in the presence of noise. Three low complexity methods are proposed for reducing the impact of overhead in the sum network throughput by partitioning users into orthogonal groups. The first method allocates spectrum to the groups equally, creating an imbalance in the sum rate of each group. The second proposed method allocates spectrum unequally among the groups to provide rate fairness. Finally, geographic grouping is proposed for cases where some receivers do not observe significant interference from other transmitters. For each partitioning method, the optimal solution not only requires a brute force search over all possible partitions, but also requires full channel state information, thereby defeating the purpose of partitioning. We therefore propose greedy methods to solve the problems, requiring no instantaneous channel knowledge. Simulations show that the proposed greedy methods switch from time-division to interference alignment as the coherence time of the channel increases, and have a small loss relative to optimal partitioning only at moderate coherence times.",0
"The increasing access to brain signal data using electroencephalography creates new opportunities to study electrophysiological brain activity and perform ambulatory diagnoses of neuronal diseases. This work proposes a pairwise distance learning approach for Schizophrenia classification relying on the spectral properties of the signal. Given the limited number of observations (i.e. the case and/or control individuals) in clinical trials, we propose a Siamese neural network architecture to learn a discriminative feature space from pairwise combinations of observations per channel. In this way, the multivariate order of the signal is used as a form of data augmentation, further supporting the network generalization ability. Convolutional layers with parameters learned under a cosine contrastive loss are proposed to adequately explore spectral images derived from the brain signal. Results on a case-control population show that the features extracted using the proposed neural network lead to an improved Schizophrenia diagnosis (+10pp in accuracy and sensitivity) against spectral features, thus suggesting the existence of non-trivial, discriminative electrophysiological brain patterns.",0
"The dynamics of black hole seeds in high redshift galaxies is key to understand their ability to grow via accretion and to pair in close binaries during galactic mergers. To properly follow the dynamics of black holes we develop a physically motivated model to capture unresolved dynamical friction from stars, dark matter and gas. We first validate the model and then we use it to investigate the dynamics of seed black holes born at $z\sim9$ in dwarf proto-galaxies. We perform a suite of zoom cosmological simulations with spatial resolution as high as 10 pc and with a stellar and dark matter mass resolution of $2\times10^3 \, \textrm{M}_\odot$ and $2\times10^5 \, \textrm{M}_\odot$ respectively. We first explore the dynamics of a seed black hole in the galaxy where it is born and show that it is highly erratic if the seed mass is less than $10^5\, \textrm{M}_\odot$. The dynamics is dominated by the stellar component, whose distribution is irregular and patchy, thus inducing stochasticity in the orbits: the black hole may be anywhere in the proto-galaxy. When this dwarf merges into a larger galaxy, it is paramount to simulate the process with very high spatial and mass resolution in order to correctly account for the stripping of the stellar envelope of the satellite black hole. The outcome of the encounter could be either a tight binary or, at least temporary, a wandering black hole, leading to multiple black holes in a galaxy, each inherited from a different merger.",0
"Let $E_k$ be the set of positive integers having exactly $k$ prime factors. We show that almost all intervals $[x,x+\log^{1+\varepsilon} x]$ contain $E_3$ numbers, and almost all intervals $[x,x+\log^{3.51} x]$ contain $E_2$ numbers. By this we mean that there are only $o(X)$ integers $1\leq x\leq X$ for which the mentioned intervals do not contain such numbers. The result for $E_3$ numbers is optimal up to the $\varepsilon$ in the exponent. The theorem on $E_2$ numbers improves a result of Harman, which had the exponent $7+\varepsilon$ in place of $3.51$. We will also consider general $E_k$ numbers, and find them on intervals whose lengths approach $\log x$ as $k\to \infty$.",0
"This paper further introduces and formalizes a novel concept of self-forensics for automotive vehicles, specified in the Forensic Lucid language. We argue that self-forensics, with the forensics taken out of the cybercrime domain, is applicable to """"self-dissection"""" of intelligent vehicles and hardware systems for automated incident and anomaly analysis and event reconstruction by the software with or without the aid of the engineering teams in a variety of forensic scenarios. We propose a formal design, requirements, and specification of the self-forensic enabled units (similar to blackboxes) in vehicles that will help investigation of incidents and also automated reasoning and verification of theories along with the events reconstruction in a formal model. We argue such an analysis is beneficial to improve the safety of the passengers and their vehicles, like the airline industry does for planes.",0
"The growing popularity of chatbots has brought new needs for HCI since it has changed the patterns of human interactions with computers. The conversational aspect of the interaction increases the necessity for chatbots to present social behaviors that are habitual in human-human conversations. In this survey, we argue that chatbots should be enriched with social characteristics that are coherent with users' expectations, ultimately avoiding frustration and dissatisfaction. We bring together the literature on disembodied, text-based chatbots to derive a conceptual model of social characteristics for chatbots. We analyzed 58 papers from various domains to understand how social characteristics can benefit the interactions and identify the challenges and strategies to designing them. Additionally, we discussed how characteristics may influence one another. Our results provide relevant opportunities to both researchers and designers to advance human-chatbot interactions.",0
"In this paper we show that if the refractive index, or rather (n(w) -1) satisfies the dispersion relations then, it is implied by Titchmarsh's theorem that n(w) -> 1 as w -> infinity. Any other limiting value for n(w) would violate relativistic causality, by which we mean not only that cause must precede effect but also that signals cannot travel faster-than-c (the velocity of light) in a vacuum. This paper does not claim to be a mathematically rigorous proof, but the authors hope to have succeeded in supplying a very convincing argument against faster-than-c light signals. Keywords: Dispersion relations, Kramers Kronig relations, Causality, faster-than-c signals.",0
"A stochastic process's statistical complexity stands out as a fundamental property: the minimum information required to synchronize one process generator to another. How much information is required, though, when synchronizing over a quantum channel? Recent work demonstrated that representing causal similarity as quantum state-indistinguishability provides a quantum advantage. We generalize this to synchronization and offer a sequence of constructions that exploit extended causal structures, finding substantial increase of the quantum advantage. We demonstrate that maximum compression is determined by the process's cryptic order---a classical, topological property closely allied to Markov order, itself a measure of historical dependence. We introduce an efficient algorithm that computes the quantum advantage and close noting that the advantage comes at a cost---one trades off prediction for generation complexity.",0
"The conditions imposed in the paper ['Inertial manifolds and completeness of eigenmodes for unsteady magnetic dynamos', Physica D {\bf 194} (2004) 297-319] on the fluid velocity to guarantee the existence of inertial manifolds for the kinematic dynamo problem are too demanding, in the sense that they imply that all the solutions tend exponentially to zero. The inertial manifolds are meaningful because they represent different decay rates, but the classical kinematic dynamos where the magnetic field is maintained or grows are not covered by this approach, at least until more refined estimates are found.",0
"Unsupervised learning techniques in computer vision often require learning latent representations, such as low-dimensional linear and non-linear subspaces. Noise and outliers in the data can frustrate these approaches by obscuring the latent spaces. Our main goal is deeper understanding and new development of robust approaches for representation learning. We provide a new interpretation for existing robust approaches and present two specific contributions: a new robust PCA approach, which can separate foreground features from dynamic background, and a novel robust spectral clustering method, that can cluster facial images with high accuracy. Both contributions show superior performance to standard methods on real-world test sets.",0
"We consider an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate trapped in a symmetric one-dimensional double well potential in the four-mode approximation and show that the semiclassical dynamics of the two ground state modes can be strongly influenced by a macroscopic occupation of the two excited modes. In particular, the addition of the two excited modes already unveils features related to the effect of dissipation on the condensate. In general, we find a rich dynamics that includes Rabi oscillations, a mixed Josephson-Rabi regime, self-trapping, chaotic behavior, and the existence of fixed points. We investigate how the dynamics of the atoms in the excited modes can be manipulated by controlling the atomic populations of the ground states.",0
"Via Monte Carlo simulations we study pattern and aging during coarsening in nonconserved nearest neighbor Ising model, following quenches from infinite to zero temperature, in space dimension $d=3$. The decay of the order-parameter autocorrelation function is observed to obey a power-law behavior in the long time limit. However, the exponent of the power-law, estimated accurately via a state-of-art method, violates a well-known lower bound. This surprising fact has been discussed in connection with a quantitative picture of the structural anomaly that the 3D Ising model exhibits during coarsening at zero temperature. These results are compared with those for quenches to a temperature above that of the roughening transition.",0
"Energy resolution, alpha/beta ratio, pulse-shape discrimination for gamma rays and alpha particles, temperature dependence of scintillation properties, and radioactive contamination were studied with CaMoO4 crystal scintillators. A high sensitivity experiment to search for neutrinoless double beta decay of 100-Mo by using CaMoO4 scintillators is discussed.",0
"Mechanical forces such as fluid shear have been shown to enhance cell growth and differentiation, but knowledge of their mechanistic effect on cells is limited because the local flow patterns and associated metrics are not precisely known. Here we present real-time, noninvasive measures of local hydrodynamics in 3D biomaterials based on nuclear magnetic resonance. Microflow maps were further used to derive pressure, shear and fluid permeability fields. Finally, remodeling of collagen gels in response to precise fluid flow parameters was correlated with structural changes. It is anticipated that accurate flow maps within 3D matrices will be a critical step towards understanding cell behavior in response to controlled flow dynamics.",0
"In the present work, by the help of the newly released Union2 compilation which consists of 557 Type Ia supernovae (SNIa), we calibrate 109 long Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) with the well-known Amati relation, using the cosmology-independent calibration method proposed by Liang {\it et al.}. We have obtained 59 calibrated high-redshift GRBs which can be used to constrain cosmological models without the circularity problem (we call them ``Hymnium'' GRBs sample for convenience). Then, we consider the joint constraints on 7 cosmological models from the latest observational data, namely, the combination of 557 Union2 SNIa dataset, 59 calibrated Hymnium GRBs dataset (obtained in this work), the shift parameter $R$ from the WMAP 7-year data, and the distance parameter $A$ of the measurement of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) peak in the distribution of SDSS luminous red galaxies. We also briefly consider the comparison of these 7 cosmological models.",0
We investigate the influence of nearby two-level systems on the dynamics of a qubit. The intrinsic decoherence is given by a coupling of both the qubit and the two-level systems to a heat bath. Assuming weak interactions between the qubit and the two-level systems we show that the dephasing of the qubit follows a multi-exponential decay. For a flat distribution of energy splittings of the two-level systems the multi-exponential behavior simplifies to a good approximation to a single exponential decay. The rate is given by the sum of the dephasing rate of the isolated qubit plus all relaxation rates for the two-level systems out of their present state. This latter contribution sums up to a rate approximately given by the mean coupling between the qubit and the two-level systems times the number of thermally active neighbors.,0
"We analyse theoretically the conductivity of a quantum Hall system exposed to microwave radiation. We find that whenever microwave frequency and cyclotron frequency are commensurate, there is a {\em resonance} in the longitudinal conductivity. This resonance has the form of the derivative of a Lorentz function; precisely at the center of the resonance, the microwave induced conductivity vanishes. Between the resonances there are maxima and minima, the depths and precise positions of which depend on the microwave amplitude and the scattering rate of the impurities. We demonstrate the existence of these resonances by a microscopic, analytical calculation of the conductivity in lowest order in the microwave intensity and show here that the conductivity is independent of the microwave polarization, linear or circular. We then discuss the general case and predict minima in the longitudinal conductivity corresponding to fractional values of the microwave frequency divided by the cyclotron frequency.",0
"The India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) collaboration has chosen glass Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) as the active detector elements for the Iron Calorimeter (ICAL) experiment. In the present work, we study the electrical properties such as bulk resistivity and relative permittivity of the glasses from two different manufacturers and compared the performances of RPCs built using these glasses. We conclude that the glass electrodes with larger bulk resistivy and permittivity are better suited for manufacturing RPCs for the ICAL experiment, as these detectors could be operated at lower bias currents and voltages, and produce better time resolutions compared to those built with glass electrodes of smaller bulk resistivity and permittivity.",0
"Consider a $n \times n$ tic-tac-toe board. In each field of the board, draw a smaller $n\times n$ tic-tac-toe board. Now let super tic-tac-toe (STTT) be a game where each player's move dictates which field on the larger board a player must make their next move. We will play an impartial game of STTT where each player uses X. We define a set of actions on a game board which gives rise to a group-action on the game that creates equivalent games. We will discuss how the structure of this group-action forms a Dihedral group.",0
"Let m and n be any integers with n>m>=2. Using just the entropy function it is possible to define a partial order on S_mn (the symmetric group on mn letters) modulo a subgroup isomorphic to S_m x S_n. We explore this partial order in the case m=2, n=3, where thanks to the outer automorphism the quotient space is actually isomorphic to a parabolic quotient of S_6. Furthermore we show that in this case it has a fairly simple algebraic description in terms of elements of the group ring.",0

"Complementing and extending the Inventiones work of Benson, Grodal, Henke [Group cohomology and control of p-fusion, Invent. Math. 197 (2014), 491--507] we give criteria for a space to have cohomology (strongly) F-isomorphic in the sense of Quillen to the stable elements. We extend results about groups models to fusion systems over discrete $p$-toral groups and profinite groups and provide various applications to the Kan-Thurston Theorem.",0
"In this paper, we review the observational properties of two accreting X-ray pulsars, the persistent source 4U1907+09 and the transient V0332+53. Accreting X-ray pulsars are among the brightest sources in the X-ray sky and are frequently observed by Integral and other X-ray missions. Nevertheless they are still very enigmatic sources as fundamental questions on the X-ray production mechanism still remain largely unanswered. These questions are addressed by performing detailed temporal and spectral studies on several objects over a long time range. Of vital importance is the study of cyclotron lines as they provide the only direct link to the magnetic field of the pulsar. While some objects show cyclotron lines which are extremely stable with time and with pulse phase, in other objects the lines strongly depend on the pulse phase, the luminosity of the source, or both. Of special interest in any case are transient sources where it is possible to study the evolution of the cyclotron line and the source in general from the onset until the end of the outburst through a wide range of different luminosity states. We present an observational review of a transient and a persistent accreting X-ray pulsar observed with Integral.",0
"The performance limits of the multilayer graphene nanoribbon (GNR) field-effect transistor (FET) are assessed and compared to those of monolayer GNR FET and carbon nanotube (CNT) FET. The results show that with a thin high-k gate insulator and reduced interlayer coupling, multilayer GNR FET can significantly outperform its CNT counterpart with a similar gate and bandgap in terms of the ballistic on-current. In the presence of optical phonon scattering, which has a short mean free path in the graphene-derived nanostructures, the advantage of the multilayer GNRFET is even more significant. The simulation results indicate multilayer GNRs with incommensurate non-AB stacking and weak interlayer coupling are the best candidate for high performance GNR FETs.",0
"We present thermal and electrical transport measurements of low-density (10$^{14}$ m$^{-2}$), mesoscopic two-dimensional electron systems (2DESs) in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures at sub-Kelvin temperatures. We find that even in the supposedly strongly localised regime, where the electrical resistivity of the system is two orders of magnitude greater than the quantum of resistance $h/e^2$, the thermopower decreases linearly with temperature indicating metallicity. Remarkably, the magnitude of the thermopower exceeds the predicted value in non-interacting metallic 2DESs at similar carrier densities by over two orders of magnitude. Our results indicate a new quantum state and possibly a novel class of itinerant quasiparticles in dilute 2DESs at low temperatures where the Coulomb interaction plays a pivotal role.",0
"Transiting planets around rapidly rotating stars are not amenable to precise radial velocity observations, such as are used for planet candidate validation, as they have wide, rotationally broadened stellar lines. Such planets can, however, be observed using Doppler tomography, wherein the stellar absorption line profile distortions during transit are spectroscopically resolved. This allows the validation of transiting planet candidates and the measurement of the stellar spin-planetary orbit (mis)alignment, an important statistical probe of planetary migration processes. We present Doppler tomographic observations which provide a direct confirmation of the hot Jupiter Kepler-13 Ab, and also show that the planet has a prograde, misaligned orbit, with lambda = 58.6 +/- 2.0 degrees. Our measured value of the spin-orbit misalignment is in significant disagreement with the value of lambda = 23 +/- 4 degrees previously measured by Barnes et al. (2011) from the gravity-darkened Kepler lightcurve. We also place an upper limit of 0.75 solar masses (95% confidence) on the mass of Kepler-13 C, the spectroscopic companion to Kepler-13 B, the proper motion companion of the planet host star Kepler-13 A.",0
"We present first results for masses of positive and negative parity excited baryons in lattice QCD using an O(a^2) improved gluon action and a Fat Link Irrelevant Clover (FLIC) fermion action in which only the irrelevant operators are constructed with fat links. The results are in agreement with earlier calculations of N^* resonances using improved actions and exhibit a clear mass splitting between the nucleon and its chiral partner, even for the Wilson fermion action. The results also indicate a splitting between the lowest J^P = 1/2^- states for the two standard nucleon interpolating fields.",0
"We report an easy and versatile route for the synthesis of the parent phase of newest superconducting wonder material i.e. p-Terphenyl. Doped p-terphenyl has recently shown superconductivity with transition temperature as high as 120K. For crystal growth, the commercially available p-Terphenyl powder is pelletized, encapsulated in evacuated (10-4 Torr) quartz tube and subjected to high temperature (260C) melt followed by slow cooling at 5C/hour. Simple temperature controlled heating furnace is used during the process. The obtained crystal is one piece, shiny and plate like. Single crystal surface XRD (X-ray Diffraction) showed unidirectional (00l) lines, indicating that the crystal is grown along c-direction. Powder XRD of the specimen showed that as grown p-Terphenyl is crystallized in monoclinic structure with space group P21/a space group, having lattice parameters a = 8.08(2) A, b = 5.62(5) A and c= 13.58(3) A. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) pictures of the crystal showed clear layered slab like growth without any visible contamination from oxygen. Characteristic reported Raman active modes related to C-C-C bending, C-H bending, C-C stretching and C-H stretching vibrations are seen clearly for the studied p-Terphenyl crystal. The physical properties of crystal are yet underway. The short letter reports an easy and versatile crystal growth method for obtaining quality p-terphenyl. The same growth method may probably be applied to doped p-terphenyl and to subsequently achieve superconductivity to the tune of as high 120K for the newest superconductivity wonder i.e., High Tc Oraganic Superconductor (HTOS).",0
"Estimating set similarity and detecting highly similar sets are fundamental problems in areas such as databases, machine learning, and information retrieval. MinHash is a well-known technique for approximating Jaccard similarity of sets and has been successfully used for many applications such as similarity search and large scale learning. Its two compressed versions, b-bit MinHash and Odd Sketch, can significantly reduce the memory usage of the original MinHash method, especially for estimating high similarities (i.e., similarities around 1). Although MinHash can be applied to static sets as well as streaming sets, of which elements are given in a streaming fashion and cardinality is unknown or even infinite, unfortunately, b-bit MinHash and Odd Sketch fail to deal with streaming data. To solve this problem, we design a memory efficient sketch method, MaxLogHash, to accurately estimate Jaccard similarities in streaming sets. Compared to MinHash, our method uses smaller sized registers (each register consists of less than 7 bits) to build a compact sketch for each set. We also provide a simple yet accurate estimator for inferring Jaccard similarity from MaxLogHash sketches. In addition, we derive formulas for bounding the estimation error and determine the smallest necessary memory usage (i.e., the number of registers used for a MaxLogHash sketch) for the desired accuracy. We conduct experiments on a variety of datasets, and experimental results show that our method MaxLogHash is about 5 times more memory efficient than MinHash with the same accuracy and computational cost for estimating high similarities.",0
"We successfully observed the frequency distribution of Cu nuclear spin-lattice relaxation time in the superconducting state of single crystals Bi2212, which we believe corresponds to a theoretical suggestion from the analysis of the energy gap distribution in STM/STS (Mori et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 101 (2008) 247003).",0
"Observations show that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating. This requires that the dominant constituent of matter in the Universe has some unusual properties like negative pressure. This exotic component has been given the name dark energy. We work with the simplest model of dark energy, the cosmological constant introduced by Einstein. We study the evolution of spherical over-densities in such a model and show that there is a minimum over-density required for collapse: perturbations with a smaller amplitude do not collapse. This threshold is interesting as even perturbations with a positive over-density and negative energy do not collapse in finite time. Further, we show that perturbations with an amplitude larger than, but comparable to the threshold value, take a very long time to collapse. We compare the solutions with the case when dark energy is absent.",0
The following article deals with the critical value p_c of the three-dimensional bootstrap percolation. We will check the behavior of p_c for different lengths of the lattice and additionally we will scale p_c in the limit of an infinite lattice.,0
"The free energy is evaluated for a uniaxial superconductor with the anisotropy of the upper critical field, gamma_H = H_{c2,ab}/H_{c2,c}, different from the anisotropy of the penetration depth gamma_{lambda} = lambda_c/lambda_{ab}. With increasing difference between gamma_H and gamma_{lambda}, the equilibrium orientation of the crystal relative to the applied field may shift from theta = pi/2 (theta is the angle between the field and the c axis) to lower angles and reach theta = 0 for large enough gamma_H. These effects are expected to take place in MgB_2.",0
A new integral equation for three-magnon bound states in XXZ spin chain is suggested. Unlike the one presented by C. K. Majumdar about 40 years ago this equation does not have spurious solutions. Such an advantage is a result of decomposition of the wave function in the Bloch basis rather than in the basis of flat waves.,0
"The near-field interaction between fluorescent emitters and graphene exhibits rich physics associated with local dipole-induced electromagnetic fields that are strongly enhanced due to the unique properties of graphene. Here, we measure emitter lifetimes as a function of emitter-graphene distance d, and find agreement with a universal scaling law, governed by the fine-structure constant. The observed energy transfer- rate is in agreement with a 1/d^4 dependence that is characteristic of 2D lossy media. The emitter decay rate is enhanced 90 times (transfer efficiency of ~99%) with respect to the decay in vacuum at distances d ~ 5 nm. This high energy-transfer rate is mainly due to the two-dimensionality and gapless character of the monoatomic carbon layer. Graphene is thus shown to be an extraordinary energy sink, holding great potential for photodetection, energy harvesting, and nanophotonics.",0
"We provide a general procedure to calculate the current-induced spin-transfer torque which acts on a general steep magnetic texture due to the exchange interaction with an applied spin-polarized current. As an example, we consider a one-dimensional ferromagnetic quantum wire and also include a Rashba spin-orbit interaction. The spin-transfer torque becomes generally spatially non-local. Likewise, the Rashba spin-orbit interaction induces a spatially nonlocal field-like nonequilibrium spin-transfer torque. We also find a spatially varying nonadiabaticity parameter and markedly different domain wall dynamics for very steep textures as compared to wide domain walls.",0
"Recently, one-stage object detectors gain much attention due to their simplicity in practice. Its fully convolutional nature greatly reduces the difficulty of training and deployment compared with two-stage detectors which require NMS and sorting for the proposal stage. However, a fundamental issue lies in all one-stage detectors is the misalignment between anchor boxes and convolutional features, which significantly hinders the performance of one-stage detectors. In this work, we first reveal the deep connection between the widely used im2col operator and the RoIAlign operator. Guided by this illuminating observation, we propose a RoIConv operator which aligns the features and its corresponding anchors in one-stage detection in a principled way. We then design a fully convolutional AlignDet architecture which combines the flexibility of learned anchors and the preciseness of aligned features. Specifically, our AlignDet achieves a state-of-the-art mAP of 44.1 on the COCO test-dev with ResNeXt-101 backbone.",0
"The control of light scattering is essential in many quantum optical experiments. Wavefront shaping is a technique used for ultimate control over wave propagation in multiple-scattering materials by adaptive manipulation of incident waves. We control the propagation of single-photon Fock states in opaque scattering materials by phase modulation of the incident wavefront. We enhance the probability that a single photon arrives in a target output mode with a factor 10. Our proof-of-principle experiment shows that wavefront shaping can be applied to non-classical light, with prospective applications in quantum communication and quantum cryptography.",0
"II-VI and III-V tetrahedral semiconductors have significant potential for novel optoelectronic applications. In the present work, some of the optical and electronic properties of these groups of semiconductors have been studied using a recently proposed empirical relationship for refractive index from energy gap. The calculated values of these properties are also compared with those calculated from some well known relationships. From an analysis of the calculated electronic polarisability of these tetrahedral binary semiconductors from different formulations, we have proposed an empirical relation for its calculation. The predicted values of electronic polarisability of these semiconductors agree fairly well with the known values over a wide range of energy gap.",0
The AdS_2\timesS^2 geometry of near-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black holes can be described by an effective solvable model which allows to follow analytically the evaporation process including the backreaction. We find that an infinite amount of time is required for the black hole to decay to extremality.,0
The model independent analysis of the $dp$ elastic scattering in the collinear geometry has been performed. It is shown that the measurements of 10 polarization observables of the first and second order realize the complete experimental program on the determination of the amplitudes of the $dp$ backward elastic scattering reaction.,0
"The so-called ``creeping'' motion of the pinned vortices in a rotating superfluid involves ``random unpinning'' and ``vortex motion'' as two physically separate processes. We argue that such a creeping motion of the vortices need not be (biased) in the direction of an existing radial Magnus force, nor should a constant microscopic radial velocity be assigned to the vortex motion, in contradiction with the basic assumptions of the ``vortex creep'' model. We point out internal inconsistencies in the predictions of this model which arise due to this unjustified foundation that ignores the role of the actual torque on the superfluid. The proper spin-down rate of a pinned superfluid is then calculated and turns out to be much less than that suggested in the vortex creep model, hence being of even less observational significance for its possible application in explaining the post-glitch relaxations of the radio pulsars.",0
"This paper provides some statistics for the coefficients of Russell- Type modular equations for the modular function, {\lambda}({\tau}). The results hold uniformly for all odd primes. They do not rely on any numerical evaluations of coefficients of q expansions of {\lambda}. The method relies on an internal structure of the coefficients of {\lambda} expressed in terms of multiplicative functions defined on integer partitions. The method may be extended to other types of modular equations.",0
"We study local correlations of certain interacting particle systems on the real line which show repulsion similar to eigenvalues of random Hermitian matrices. Although the new particle system does not seem to have a natural spectral or determinantal representation, the local correlations in the bulk coincide in the limit of infinitely many particles with those known from random Hermitian matrices; in particular they can be expressed as determinants of the so-called sine kernel. These results may provide an explanation for the appearance of sine kernel correlation statistics in a number of situations which do not have an obvious interpretation in terms of random matrices.",0
"Spatial reaction-diffusion models have been employed to describe many emergent phenomena in biological systems. The modelling technique most commonly adopted in the literature implements systems of partial differential equations (PDEs), which assumes there are sufficient densities of particles that a continuum approximation is valid. However, due to recent advances in computational power, the simulation, and therefore postulation, of computationally intensive individual-based models has become a popular way to investigate the effects of noise in reaction-diffusion systems in which regions of low copy numbers exist. The stochastic models with which we shall be concerned in this manuscript are referred to as `compartment-based'. These models are characterised by a discretisation of the computational domain into a grid/lattice of `compartments'. Within each compartment particles are assumed to be well-mixed and are permitted to react with other particles within their compartment or to transfer between neighbouring compartments. We develop two hybrid algorithms in which a PDE is coupled to a compartment-based model. Rather than attempting to balance average fluxes, our algorithms answer a more fundamental question: `how are individual particles transported between the vastly different model descriptions?' First, we present an algorithm derived by carefully re-defining the continuous PDE concentration as a probability distribution. Whilst this first algorithm shows strong convergence to analytic solutions of test problems, it can be cumbersome to simulate. Our second algorithm is a simplified and more efficient implementation of the first, it is derived in the continuum limit over the PDE region alone. We test our hybrid methods for functionality and accuracy in a variety of different scenarios by comparing the averaged simulations to analytic solutions of PDEs for mean concentrations.",0
"In this work we use genetic algorithm to search for the gravitational wave signal from the inspiralling massive Black Hole binaries in the simulated LISA data. We consider a single signal in the Gaussian instrumental noise. This is a first step in preparation for analysis of the third round of the mock LISA data challenge. We have extended a genetic algorithm utilizing the properties of the signal and the detector response function. The performance of this method is comparable, if not better, to already existing algorithms.",0
"Two special calorimeters are foreseen for the instrumentation of the very forward region of the ILC detector, a luminometer designed to measure the rate of low angle Bhabha scattering events with a precision better than 10-3 and a low polar angle calorimeter, adjacent to the beam-pipe. The latter will be hit by a large amount of beamstrahlung remnants. The amount and shape of these depositions will allow a fast luminosity estimate and the determination of beam parameters. The sensors of this calorimeter must be radiation hard. Both devices will improve the hermeticity of the detector in the search for new particles. Finely segmented and very compact calorimeters will match the requirements. Due to the high occupancy fast front-end electronics is needed. The design of the calorimeters developed and optimised with Monte Carlo simulations is presented. Sensors and readout electronics ASICs have been designed and prototypes are available. Results on the performance of these major components are summarised.",0
"Sky conditions in the remote, dry north-western interior of South Africa are now the subject of considerable interest in view of the imminent construction of numerous solar power plants in this area. Furthermore, the part of this region in which the core of the SKA is to be located (which includes SALT) has been declared an Astronomical Advantage Zone, for which sky brightness monitoring will now be mandatory. In this project we seek to characterise the sky brightness profile under a variety of atmospheric conditions. Key factors are of course the lunar phase and altitude, but in addition the sky brightness is also significantly affected by the atmospheric aerosol loading, as that influences light beam scattering. In this paper we chose to investigate the sky characteristics soon after the Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption in 1991, which resulted in huge ash masses reaching the stratosphere (where they affected solar irradiance for several years). We re-reduced photometric sky measurements from the South African Astronomical Observatory archives (and originally obtained by us) in different wavelengths and in a variety of directions. We use this data explore relationships between the aerosol loading and the sky brightness in a range of conditions, including several post-Pinatubo phases and during the passage of biomass burning induced haze and dust clouds. We use this data to explore the impact of our findings on the applicability of light scattering models and light scatterer properties.",0
"A $\lambda$-fold $r$-packing in a Hamming metric space is a code $C$ such that the radius-$r$ balls centered in $C$ cover each vertex of the space by not more than $\lambda$-times. The well-known $r$-error-correcting codes correspond to the case $\lambda=1$. We propose asymptotic bounds for $q$-ary $2$-fold $1$-packings as $q$ grows, find that the maximum size of a binary $2$-fold $1$-packing of length $9$ is $96$, and derive upper bounds for the size of a binary $\lambda$-fold $1$-packing.",0
The first result of the neutrino magnetic moment measurement at the Kalininskaya Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) with the GEMMA spectrometer is presented. An antineutrino-electron scattering is investigated. A high-purity germanium detector of 1.5 kg placed 13.9 m away from the 3 GW reactor core is used in the spectrometer. The antineutrino flux is $2.73\times 10^{13} \nu_e / cm^2 / s$. The differential method is used to extract the $\nu$-e electromagnetic scattering events. The scattered electron spectra taken in 6200 and 2064 hours for the reactor ON and OFF periods are compared. The upper limit for the neutrino magnetic moment $\mu_\nu < 5.8\times 10^{-11}$ Bohr magnetons at 90{%} CL is derived from the data processing.,0
"In the framework of $RGM$, the binding energy of the six quark system with strangeness s=-5 is systematically investigated under the SU(3) chiral constituent quark model. The single $\Xi^*\Omega$ channel calculation with spins S=0 and 3 and the coupled $\Xi\Omega$ and $\Xi^*\Omega$ channel calculation with spins S=1 and 2 are considered, respectively. The results show following observations: In the spin=0 case, $\Xi^* \Omega$ is a bound dibaryon with the binding energy being $80.0 \sim 92.4 MeV$. In the S=1 case, $\Xi\Omega$ is also a bound dibaryon. Its binding energy is ranged from $26.2 MeV$ to $32.9 MeV$. In the S=2 and S=3 cases, no evidence of bound dibaryons are found. The phase shifts and scattering lengths in the S=0 and S=1 cases are also given.",0
"A self-consistent treatment of exchange and correlation interactions in a quantum wire (QW) subject to a strong perpendicular magnetic field is presented using a modified local-density approximation (MLDA). The influence of many-body interactions on the spin-splitting between the two lowest Landau levels (LLs) is calculated within the screened Hartree-Fock approximation (SHFA), for filling factor \nu=1, and the strong spatial dependence of the screening properties of electrons is taken into account. In comparison with the Hartree-Fock result, the spatial behavior of the occupied LL in a QW is strongly modified when correlations are included. Correlations caused by screening at the edges strongly suppress the exchange splitting and smoothen the energy dispersion at the edges. The theory accounts well for the experimentally observed strong suppression of the spin-splitting pertinent to the \nu=1 quantum Hall effect (QHE) state as well as the destruction of this state in long, quasi-ballistic GaAlAs/GaAs QWs.",0
"We link linear prediction of Chebyshev and Fourier expansions to analytic continuation. We push the resolution in the Chebyshev-based computation of $T=0$ many-body spectral functions to a much higher precision by deriving a modified Chebyshev series expansion that allows to reduce the expansion order by a factor $\sim\frac{1}{6}$. We show that in a certain limit the Chebyshev technique becomes equivalent to computing spectral functions via time evolution and subsequent Fourier transform. This introduces a novel recursive time evolution algorithm that instead of the group operator $e^{-iHt}$ only involves the action of the generator $H$. For quantum impurity problems, we introduce an adapted discretization scheme for the bath spectral function. We discuss the relevance of these results for matrix product state (MPS) based DMRG-type algorithms, and their use within dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). We present strong evidence that the Chebyshev recursion extracts less spectral information from $H$ than time evolution algorithms when fixing a given amount of created entanglement.",0
We provide a simple set of sufficient conditions for the weak convergence of discrete Galton-Watson branching processes with immigration to continuous time and continuous state branching processes with immigration.,0
"Imputation using external reference panels is a widely used approach for increasing power in GWAS and meta-analysis. Existing HMM-based imputation approaches require individual-level genotypes. Here, we develop a new method for Gaussian imputation from summary association statistics, a type of data that is becoming widely available. In simulations using 1000 Genomes (1000G) data, this method recovers 84% (54%) of the effective sample size for common (>5%) and low-frequency (1-5%) variants (increasing to 87% (60%) when summary LD information is available from target samples) versus 89% (67%) for HMM-based imputation, which cannot be applied to summary statistics. Our approach accounts for the limited sample size of the reference panel, a crucial step to eliminate false-positive associations, and is computationally very fast. As an empirical demonstration, we apply our method to 7 case-control phenotypes from the WTCCC data and a study of height in the British 1958 birth cohort (1958BC). Gaussian imputation from summary statistics recovers 95% (105%) of the effective sample size (as quantified by the ratio of $\chi^2$ association statistics) compared to HMM-based imputation from individual-level genotypes at the 227 (176) published SNPs in the WTCCC (1958BC height) data. In addition, for publicly available summary statistics from large meta-analyses of 4 lipid traits, we publicly release imputed summary statistics at 1000G SNPs, which could not have been obtained using previously published methods, and demonstrate their accuracy by masking subsets of the data. We show that 1000G imputation using our approach increases the magnitude and statistical evidence of enrichment at genic vs. non-genic loci for these traits, as compared to an analysis without 1000G imputation. Thus, imputation of summary statistics will be a valuable tool in future functional enrichment analyses.",0
"A hyperfinite $II_1$ subfactor may be obtained from a symmetric commuting square via iteration of the basic construction. For certain commuting squares constructed from Hadamard matrices, we describe this subfactor as a group-type inclusion $R^H \subset R \rtimes K$, where $H$ and $K$ are finite groups with outer actions on the hyperfinite $II_1$ factor $R$. We find the group of outer automorphisms generated by $H$ and $K$, and use the method of Bisch and Haagerup to determine the principal and dual principal graphs. In some cases a complete classification is obtained by examining the element of $H^3(H \ast K / Int R)$ associated with the action.",0
"In this paper, we establish stability of parabolic Harnack inequalities for symmetric non-local Dirichlet forms on metric measure spaces under general volume doubling condition. We obtain their stable equivalent characterizations in terms of the jumping kernels, variants of cutoff Sobolev inequalities, and Poincar\'e inequalities. In particular, we establish the connection between parabolic Harnack inequalities and two-sided heat kernel estimates, as well as with the H\""""older regularity of parabolic functions for symmetric non-local Dirichlet forms.",0
"We propose a framework for adversarial training that relies on a sample rather than a single sample point as the fundamental unit of discrimination. Inspired by discrepancy measures and two-sample tests between probability distributions, we propose two such distributional adversaries that operate and predict on samples, and show how they can be easily implemented on top of existing models. Various experimental results show that generators trained with our distributional adversaries are much more stable and are remarkably less prone to mode collapse than traditional models trained with pointwise prediction discriminators. The application of our framework to domain adaptation also results in considerable improvement over recent state-of-the-art.",0
"The ability to accurately predict and simulate human driving behavior is critical for the development of intelligent transportation systems. Traditional modeling methods have employed simple parametric models and behavioral cloning. This paper adopts a method for overcoming the problem of cascading errors inherent in prior approaches, resulting in realistic behavior that is robust to trajectory perturbations. We extend Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning to the training of recurrent policies, and we demonstrate that our model outperforms rule-based controllers and maximum likelihood models in realistic highway simulations. Our model both reproduces emergent behavior of human drivers, such as lane change rate, while maintaining realistic control over long time horizons.",0
"In this paper we derive quantitative estimates for the Lagrangian flow associated to a partially regular vector field of the form $$ b(t,x_1,x_2) = (b_1(t,x_1),b_2(t,x_1,x_2)) \in {\mathbb R}^{n_1}\times{\mathbb R}^{n_2} \,, \qquad (x_1,x_2)\in{\mathbb R}^{n_1}\times{\mathbb R}^{n_2}\,. $$ We assume that the first component $b_1$ does not depend on the second variable $x_2$, and has Sobolev $W^{1,p}$ regularity in the variable $x_1$, for some $p>1$. On the other hand, the second component $b_2$ has Sobolev $W^{1,p}$ regularity in the variable $x_2$, but only fractional Sobolev $W^{\alpha,1}$ regularity in the variable $x_1$, for some $\alpha>1/2$. These estimates imply well-posedness, compactness, and quantitative stability for the Lagrangian flow associated to such a vector field.",0
"The evergreen Quercus alnifolia and Q. coccifera form the only interfertile pair of oak species growing in Cyprus. Hybridization between the two species has already been observed and studied morphologically. However, little evidence exists about the extent of genetic introgression. In the present study, we aimed to study the effects of introgressive hybridization mutually on both chloroplast and nuclear genomes. We sampled both pure and mixed populations of Q. alnifolia and Q. coccifera from several locations across their distribution area in Cyprus. We analyzed the genetic variation within and between species by conducting Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) based on nuclear microsatellites. Population genetic structure and levels of admixture were studied by means of a Bayesian analysis (STRUCTURE simulation analysis). Chloroplast DNA microsatellites were used for a spatial analysis of genetic barriers. The main part of the nuclear genetic variation was explained by partition into species groups. High interspecific differentiation and low admixture of nuclear genomes, both in pure and mixed populations, support limited genetic introgression between Q. alnifolia and Q. coccifera in Cyprus. On the contrary, chloroplast DNA haplotypes were shared between the species and were locally structured suggesting cytoplasmic introgression. Occasional hybridization events followed by backcrossings with both parental species might lead to this pattern of genetic differentiation.",0
The derivation of the recently proposed nonlinear quantum evolution of gravity from an action principle is considered in this brief note. It is shown to be possible if a set of consistency conditions are satisfied that are analogous to the Dirac relations for the super-Hamiltonian and momenta in classical canonical gravity.,0
We show that a metric of arbitrary dimension and signature which allows for a standard Wick-rotation to a Riemannian metric necessarily has a purely electric Riemann and Weyl tensor.,0
"The relationships between supermassive black holes and the properties of their associated dark-matter halos imply that outflows from accreting black holes provide a feedback mechanism regulating galaxy formation. Accreting black holes with weak or undetectable radio jets (radio-quiet quasars) outnumber those with powerful jets (radio-loud quasars) by a factor ~10-100, so powerful-jet outflows are often neglected. However, whenever powerful jets are triggered, there is a dramatic (factor >100) step-function increase in the efficiency of feedback. We use a feedback model, together with the measured space density of flat-spectrum radio-loud quasars, to show that a powerful-jet episode probably occurred in every protocluster in the Universe. Before jet triggering, there was time for gravitational collapse to create many (~10-100) surrounding protogalaxies massive enough to host radio-quiet quasars. After triggering, the powerful jet pushes back and heats ionized gas so that it cannot fall onto these protogalaxies and cool. Once neutral/molecular gas reservoirs become exhausted, there is a synchronized shut down in both star-formation and black-hole activity throughout the protocluster. These considerations imply that radio-loud quasars have a profound influence on the evolution of all the galaxies seen in clusters today.",0
"An inhomogeneous Kaluza-Klein compactification of a higher dimensional spacetime may give rise to an effective 4d spacetime with distinct domains having different sizes of the extra dimensions. The domains are separated by domain walls generated by the extra dimensional scale factor. The scattering of electromagnetic and massive particle waves at such boundaries is examined here for models without warping or branes. We consider the limits corresponding to thin (thick) domain walls, i.e., limits where wavelengths are large (small) in comparison to wall thickness. We also obtain numerical solutions for a wall of arbitrary thickness and extract the reflection and transmission coefficients as functions of frequency. Results are obtained which qualitatively resemble those for electroweak domain walls and other """"ordinary"""" domain walls for 4d theories.",0
"We report on optical transmission spectroscopy of the Cr-based frustrated triangular antiferromagnets CuCrO2 and alpha-CaCr2O4, and the spinels CdCr2O4 and ZnCr2O4 in the near-infrared to visible-light frequency range. We explore the possibility to search for spin correlations far above the magnetic ordering temperature and for anomalies in the magnon lifetime in the magnetically ordered state by probing exciton-magnon sidebands of the spin-forbidden crystal-field transitions of the Cr3+ ions (spin S = 3/2). In CuCrO2 and alpha-CaCr2O4 the appearance of fine structures below T_N is assigned to magnon sidebands by comparison with neutron scattering results. The temperature dependence of the line width of the most intense sidebands in both compounds can be described by an Arrhenius law. For CuCrO2 the sideband associated with the 4A2 -> 2T2 transition can be observed even above T_N. Its line width does not show a kink at the magnetic ordering temperature and can alternatively be described by a Z2 vortex scenario proposed previously for similar materials. The exciton-magnon features in alpha-CaCr2O4 are more complex due to the orthorhombic distortion. While for CdCr2O4 magnon sidebands are identified below T_N and one sideband excitation is found to persist across the magnetic ordering transition, only a weak fine structure related to magnetic ordering has been observed in ZnCr2O4.",0
"The nucleon resonances are investigated within a dynamical coupled-channels model of pi N and gamma N reactions up to the invariant mass W = 2 GeV. The meson-baryon (MB) channels included in the calculations are MB = pi N, eta N, K Lambda, K Sigma, and pi pi N that has pi Delta, rho N, and sigma N resonant components. The meson-baryon amplitudes T_{M'B',MB}(W) are calculated from solving a set of coupled-channels integral equations defined by an interaction Hamiltonian consisting of (a) meson-exchange interactions v_{M'B',MB} derived from phenomenological Lagrangian, and (b) vertex interactions N* --> MB for describing the transition of a bare excited nucleon state N* to a channel MB. The parameters of v_{M'B',MB} are mainly constrained by the fit to the data of pi N --> pi N in the low energy region up to W =1.4 GeV. The bare masses of N* and the N* --> MB parameters are then determined in simultaneous fits to the data of pi N --> pi N up to W =2.3 GeV and those of pi N --> eta N, K Lambda, K Sigma and gamma N --> pi N, eta N, K Lambda, K Sigma up to W = 2.1 GeV. The pole positions and residues of nucleon resonances are extracted by analytically continuing the meson-baryon amplitudes T_{M'B',MB}(W) to the complex Riemann energy surface. From the extracted residues, we have determined the N* --> pi N, gamma N, eta N, K Lambda, K Sigma transition amplitudes at resonance poles. We compare the resonance pole positions from our analysis with those given by Particle Data Group and the recent coupled-channels analyses by the Juelich and Bonn-Gatchina groups. Four results agree well only for the first N* in each spin-parity-isospin (J^P,I) channel. For higher mass states, the number of states and their resonance positions from four results do not agree well. We discuss the possible sources of the discrepancies and the need of additional data from new hadron facilities such as J-PARC.",0
"We employ the conditional version of sandwiched Tsallis relative entropy to determine 1:N-1 separability range in the noisy one-parameter families of pseudopure and Werner-like N-qubit W, GHZ states. The range of the noisy parameter, for which the conditional sandwiched Tsallis relative entropy is positive, reveals perfect agreement with the necessary and sufficient criteria for the separability in the 1:N-1 partition of these one parameter noisy states.",0
"We critically examine the recent claim that the Standard Model Higgs boson ${\cal H}$ could drive inflation in agreement with observations if $|{\cal H}|^2$ has a strong coupling $\xi\sim 10^4$ to the Ricci curvature scalar. We first show that the effective theory approach upon which that claim is based ceases to be valid beyond a cutoff scale $\Lambda=m_p/\xi$, where $m_p$ is the reduced Planck mass. We then argue that knowing the Higgs potential profile for the field values relevant for inflation ($|{\cal H}|>m_p/\sqrt{\xi}\gg \Lambda$) requires knowledge of the ultraviolet completion of the SM beyond $\Lambda$. In absence of such microscopic theory, the extrapolation of the pure SM potential beyond $\Lambda$ is unwarranted and the scenario is akin to other ad-hoc inflaton potentials afflicted with significant fine-tuning. The appealing naturalness of this minimal proposal is therefore lost.",0
"We report on a study of microstructure and its quasi-periodicities of three pulsars at 1.65 GHz with the S2 VLBI system at a resolution of 62.5 ns, by far the highest for any such statistical study yet. For PSR B1929+10 we found in the average cross-correlation function (CCF) broad microstructure with a characteristic timescale of 95+-10 mcs and confirmed microstructure with characteristic timescales between 100 and 450 mcs for PSRs B0950+08 and B1133+16. On a finer scale PSRs B0950+08, B1133+16 (component II) and B1929+10 show narrow microstructure with a characteristic timescale in the CCFs of ~10 mcs, the shortest found in the average CCF or autocorrelation function (ACF) for any pulsar, apart perhaps for the Crab pulsar. Histograms of microstructure widths are skewed heavily toward shorter timescales but display a sharp cutoff. The shortest micropulses have widths between 2 and 7 mcs. No nanopulses or unresolved pulse spikes were detected. Cross-power spectra of single pulses show a large range of complexity with single spectral features representing classic quasi-periodicities and broad and overlapping features with essentially no periodicities at all. Significant differences were found for the two components of PSR B1133+16 in every aspect of our statistical analysis of micropulses and their quasi-periodicities. Asymmetries in the magnetosphere and the hollow cone of emission above the polar cap of the neutron star may be responsible for these differences.",0
"We report the observation of a Griffiths Phase in the geometrically frustrated antiferromagnet DyBaCo${_4}$O${_{7+\delta}}$. Its onset is determined using measurements of the thermoremanent magnetization, which is shown to be superior to conventional in-field measurement protocols for the identification of the Griffiths Phase. Within this phase, the temporal relaxation of magnetization exhibits a functional form which is expected for Heisenberg systems, reflecting the nature of spin interactions in this class of materials. Interestingly, the effective Co${^{2+}}$/Co${^{3+}}$ ratio tailored by varying the oxygen non-stoichiometry $\delta$ is only seen to influence the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature ($T{_N}$), leaving the Griffiths Temperature ($T{_G}$) invariant.",0
"Fully-homomorphic encryption (FHE) enables computation on encrypted data while maintaining secrecy. Recent research has shown that such schemes exist even for quantum computation. Given the numerous applications of classical FHE (zero-knowledge proofs, secure two-party computation, obfuscation, etc.) it is reasonable to hope that quantum FHE (or QFHE) will lead to many new results in the quantum setting. However, a crucial ingredient in almost all applications of FHE is circuit verification. Classically, verification is performed by checking a transcript of the homomorphic computation. Quantumly, this strategy is impossible due to no-cloning. This leads to an important open question: can quantum computations be delegated and verified in a non-interactive manner? In this work, we answer this question in the affirmative, by constructing a scheme for QFHE with verification (vQFHE). Our scheme provides authenticated encryption, and enables arbitrary polynomial-time quantum computations without the need of interaction between client and server. Verification is almost entirely classical; for computations that start and end with classical states, it is completely classical. As a first application, we show how to construct quantum one-time programs from classical one-time programs and vQFHE.",0
The temperature and density dependence of the $\rho-\omega$ mixing amplitude has been studied from a purely hadronic model. The in-medium baryon masses and chemical potentials have been obtained at the Mean Field (MF) Level and these results have been used to calculate the mixing amplitude. It has been observed that the mixing amplitude changes substantially at high temperature and density.,0
"Online Social Networking may be a way to support health professionals' need for continuous learning through interaction with peers and experts. Understanding and evaluating such learning is important but difficult, and Social Network Analysis (SNA) offers a solution. This paper demonstrates how SNA can be used to study levels of participation as well as the patterns of interactions that take place among health professionals in a large online professional learning network. Our analysis has shown that their learning network is highly centralised and loosely connected. The level of participation is low in general, and most interactions are structured around a small set of users consisting of moderators and core members. The structural patterns of interaction indicates there is a chance of small group learning occurring and requires further investigation to identify those potential learning groups. This first stage of analysis, to be followed by longitudinal study of the dynamics of interaction and complemented by content analysis of their discussion, may contribute to greater sophistication in the analysis and utilisation of new environments for health professional learning.",0
"The formation of various uncommon shaped voids along with regular triangular and square voids in the epitaxial 3C-SiC films on Si has been investigated by optical microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Heteroepitaxial growth of 3C-SiC films on Si (001) and (111) substrates has been performed using hexamethyldisilane in a resistance-heated chemical vapor deposition reactor. The influence of the orientation of the Si substrate in determining the shape of the voids has clearly been observed. In addition, the growth period and the growth-temperature have been considered as the major parameters to control the size, density and shape of the voids. Generally, voids are faceted along {111} planes, but depending upon growth conditions, other facets with higher surface energy have also been observed. Finally the size and density of the voids are remarkably reduced, by suitable growth technique.",0
"In the thermoelastic regime, photoacoustic sensing of optical absorption relies on conversion from light to acoustic energy via the coefficient of thermal expansion \beta. In this work, we confront confront experimental measurements to theoretical predictions of nonlinear photoacoustic generation based on the dynamic variation of \beta(T) during the optical excitation of absorbers in aqueous solution. The photoacoustic generation from solutions of organic dye and gold nanospheres (with same optical densities), illuminated with 532 nm nanosecond pulses, was detected using a high frequency ultrasound transducer (center frequency 20 MHz). Photoacoustic emission was observed with gold nanospheres at low fluence (a few mJ/cm2) for an equilibrium temperature around 4{\deg}C, where the linear photoacoustic effect in water vanishes, highlighting the nonlinear emission from the solution of nanospheres. Under the same condition, no emission was observed with the absorbing organic dye. At a fixed fluence of 5 mJ/cm2, the photoacoustic amplitude was studied as a function of the equilibrium temperature from 2{\deg}C to 20{\deg}C. While the photoacoustic amplitude from the organic dye followed \beta(T) in water and vanished around 4{\deg}C, the photoacoustic amplitude from the gold nanospheres remained significant over the whole temperature range. These experimental results are shown to be in qualitative agreement with theoretical calculations based on the nanoscale and nanosecond transient changes of the coefficient of thermal expansion of water around the gold nanospheres. Our results suggest that in the context of high frequency photoacoustic imaging, nanoparticles may be discriminated from molecular absorbers based on either the nonlinear fluence-dependence or the equilibrium temperature-dependence of the photoacoustic amplitude.",0
"We construct the conditional versions of a multidimensional random walk given that it does not leave the Weyl chambers of type C and of type D, respectively, in terms of a Doob h-transform. Furthermore, we prove functional limit theorems for the rescaled random walks. This is an extension of recent work by Eichelsbacher and Koenig who studied the analogous conditioning for the Weyl chamber of type A. Our proof follows recent work by Denisov and Wachtel who used martingale properties and a strong approximation of random walks by Brownian motion. Therefore, we are able to keep minimal moment assumptions. Finally, we present an alternate function that is amenable to an h-transform in the Weyl chamber of type C.",0
"The cosmic star formation histories are evaluated for different minimum masses of the initial halo structures, with allowance for realistic gas outflows. With a minimum halo mass of 10^{7} - 10^{8} M_odot and a moderate outflow efficiency, we reproduce both the current baryon fraction and the early chemical enrichment of the IGM. The intensity of the formation rate of ``normal'' stars is also well constrained by the observations: it has to be dominated by star formation in elliptical galaxies, except perhaps at very low redshift. The fraction of baryons in stars is predicted as are also the type Ia and II supernova event rates. Comparison with SN observations in the redshift range z=0-2 allows us to set strong constraints on the time delay of type Ia supernovae (a total delay of \sim 4 Gyr is required to fit the data), the lower end of the mass range of the progenitors (2 - 8 M_odot) and the fraction of white dwarfs that reproduce the type Ia supernova (about 1 per cent). The intensity in the initial starburst of zero metallicity stars below 270 M_\odot must be limited in order to avoid premature overenrichment of the IGM. Only about 10 - 20 % of the metals present in the IGM at z = 0 have been produced by population III stars at very high z. The remaining 80 - 90 % are ejected later by galaxies forming normal stars, with a maximum outflow efficiency occurring at a redshift of about 5. We conclude that 10^{-3} of the mass in baryons must lie in first massive stars in order to produce enough ionizing photons to allow early reionization of the IGM by z \sim 15.",0
"Methods for digital, phase-coherent acoustic communication date to at least the work of Stojanjovic, et al [20], and the added robustness afforded by improved phase tracking and compensation of Johnson, et al [21]. This work explores the use of such methods for communications through tissue for potential biomedical applications, using the tremendous bandwidth available in commercial medical ultrasound transducers. While long-range ocean acoustic experiments have been at rates of under 100kbps, typically on the order of 1- 10kbps, data rates in excess of 120Mb/s have been achieved over cm-scale distances in ultrasonic testbeds [19]. This paper describes experimental transmission of digital communication signals through samples of real pork tissue and beef liver, achieving data rates of 20-30Mbps, demonstrating the possibility of real-time video-rate data transmission through tissue for inbody ultrasonic communications with implanted medical devices.",0
"We have contacted single wall carbon nanotubes grown by chemical vapor deposition to superconducting Ti/Al/Ti electrodes. The device, we here report on is in the Kondo regime exhibiting a four-fold shell structure, where a clear signature of the superconducting electrodes is observed below the critical temperature. Multiple Andreev reflections are revealed by sub-gap structure and a narrow peak in the differential conductance around zero bias is seen depending on the shell filling. We interpret the peak as a proximity induced supercurrent and examine its interplay with Kondo resonances.",0
"A meson-baryon interaction in the charm $+1$, strangeness $-2$ and isospin $0$ sector is built from a t-channel vector meson exchange model employing effective Lagrangians. The implementation of coupled-channel unitarization in the s-wave scattering amplitudes gives rise to two structures that have similar masses and widths to those of the $\Omega_c(3050)^0$ and $\Omega_c(3090)^0$ states recently observed by the LHCb collaboration. A meson-baryon molecular interpretation of these resonances would assign their spin-parity to be $J^P=1/2^-$.",0
"The Cosserat model generalises an elastic material taking into account the possible microstructure of the elements of the material continuum. In particular, within the Cosserat model the structured material point is rigid and can only experience microrotation, which is also known as micropolar elasticity. We present the geometrically nonlinear theory taking into account all possible interaction terms between the elastic and microelastic structure. This is achieved by considering the irreducible pieces of the deformation gradient and of the dislocation curvature tensor. In addition we also consider the so-called Cosserat coupling term. In this setting we seek soliton type solutions assuming small elastic displacements, however, we allow the material points to experience full rotations which are not assumed to be small. By choosing a particular ansatz we are able to reduce the system of equations to a Sine-Gordon type equation which is known to have soliton solutions.",0

"Computers are physical systems: what they can and cannot do is dictated by the laws of physics. In particular, the speed with which a physical device can process information is limited by its energy and the amount of information that it can process is limited by the number of degrees of freedom it possesses. This paper explores the physical limits of computation as determined by the speed of light $c$, the quantum scale $\hbar$ and the gravitational constant $G$. As an example, quantitative bounds are put to the computational power of an `ultimate laptop' with a mass of one kilogram confined to a volume of one liter.",0
"The cause of the glacial cycles remains a mystery. The origin is widely accepted to be astronomical since paleoclimatic archives contain strong spectral components that match the frequencies of Earth's orbital modulation. Milankovitch insolation theory contains similar frequencies and has become established as the standard model of the glacial cycles. However, high precision paleoclimatic data have revealed serious discrepancies with the Milankovitch model that fundamentally challenge its validity and re-open the question of what causes the glacial cycles. We propose here that the ice ages are initially driven not by insolation cycles but by cosmic ray changes, probably through their effect on clouds. This conclusion is based on a wide range of evidence, including results presented here on speleothem growth in caves in Austria and Oman, and on a record of cosmic ray flux over the past 220 kyr obtained from the 10Be composition of deep-ocean sediments.",0
"Let $K:={x: g(x)\leq 1}$ be the compact sub-level set of some homogeneous polynomial $g$. Assume that the only knowledge about $K$ is the degree of $g$ as well as the moments of the Lebesgue measure on $K$ up to order 2d. Then the vector of coefficients of $g$ is solution of a simple linear system whose associated matrix is nonsingular. In other words, the moments up to order 2d of the Lebesgue measure on $K$ encode all information on the homogeneous polynomial $g$ that defines $K$ (in fact, only moments of order $d$ and 2d are needed).",0
"A tight-binding parametrization for silicon, optimized to correctly reproduce effective masses as well as the reciprocal space positions of the conduction-band minima, is presented. The reliability of the proposed parametrization is assessed by performing systematic comparisons between the descriptions of donor impurities in Si using this parametrization and previously reported ones. The spectral decomposition of the donor wavefunction demonstrates the importance of incorporating full band effects for a reliable representation, and that an incomplete real space description results from a truncated reciprocal space expansion as proposed within the effective mass theory.",0
"Chandra observations of nearby galaxies have revealed a number of X-ray sources characterized by high luminosities ($L_X > \sim10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$) and $k T$ in the range $100 - 350$ eV. These ``quasisoft X-ray sources'' (QSSs) are harder than luminous supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs), whose characteristic temperatures are tens of eV, but, with little or no emission above 2 keV, they are significantly softer than most canonical X-ray sources. They are likely to include a range of physical systems; some may be common systems in unusual states: neutron stars or stellar-mass black holes (BHs), or SNRs. Others may be accreting BHs of intermediate mass. We have analyzed {\it Chandra} data from $19 $ near-by galaxies to identify QSSs with sufficiently high count rates to allow spectral fits. Six of these galaxies have been studied in great detail; in these we find 89 SSSs and 122 QSSs. In this paper we present spectra for QSSs those with more than 50 counts. We also use data from six of these galaxies to study the broadband spectral distributions of QSSs and to compare them with those of other X-ray sources. Since QSSs in the Milky Way are likely to be missed by our selection procedures, we discuss other signatures by which they can be found. If some of the QSSs for which we have spectra are accreting BHs, the lower bounds for the BH mass range from roughly $30 M_\odot$ to $1000 M_\odot$.",0
"Mathematical problems of optimal control in quantum systems attract high interest in connection with fundamental questions and existing and prospective applications. An important problem is the development of methods for constructing controls for quantum systems. One of the commonly used methods is the Krotov method initially proposed beyond quantum control in the articles by V.F.~Krotov and I.N.~Feldman (1978, 1983). The method was used to develop a novel approach for finding optimal controls for quantum systems in [D.J. Tannor, V. Kazakov, V. Orlov, In: Time-Dependent Quantum Molecular Dynamics, Boston, Springer, 347--360 (1992)] and [J.~Soml\'{o}i, V.A.~Kazakov, D.J.~Tannor, Chem. Phys., 172:1, 85--98 (1993)], and in many works of various scientists, as described in details in this review. The review discusses mathematical aspects of this method for optimal control of closed quantum systems. It outlines various modifications with respect to defining the improvement function (which in most cases is linear or linear-quadratic), constraints on control spectrum and on the states of a quantum system, regularizers, etc. The review describes applications of the Krotov method to control of molecular dynamics, manipulation of Bose-Einstein condensate, quantum gate generation. We also discuss comparison with GRAPE (GRadient Ascent Pulse Engineering), CRAB (Chopped Random-Basis), the Zhu---Rabitz and the Maday---Turinici methods.",0
"Synthetic polarization and flux spectra are presented for aspherical, electron scattering-dominated photospheres of Type II supernovae (SN II) in general and the specific case of SN 1993J using a Monte Carlo scheme. The observed luminosity of a Type II supernova depends on the unknown inclination angle. Spectral analysis alone will fail to detect even strong deviations from spherical symmetry. Line scattering depolarizes incident polarized light, but the residual intrinsic polarization does not completely vanish because of electron scattering effects that depend on the electron density distribution. By combining results on the polarization and velocity structure of the emission lines, and the degree of polarization in the continuum, we place strong constraints on the degree of asphericity, the inclination of the system and the electron density distribution. Both the flux spectra and the percentage of polarization as a function of wavelength can be reproduced by an aspherical model with an axis ratio of 0.6, radial electron densities proportional to r**-5 and an effective temperature of 4800 K. In an oblate model, SN1993J is seen almost equator on. The line forming region is still within the hydrogen rich part of the envelope after 3 weeks, although the continuum may form in deeper layers. Although the residual polarization across Halpha is not zero, the interstellar component derived herein is consistent with that deduced by Trammell et al.(1993). The power of this technique for investigating the structure of other SN II, as a method for independently deriving the interstellar polarization, and the implications of these results on the use of SN II to determine distances through the Baade- Wesselink method are discussed.",0
"As an example of thin composite layers we consider single and double grids of periodically arranged interacting wires loaded with a certain distributed reactive impedance. Currents induced to the wires by a normally incident plane wave are rigorously calculated and the corresponding dipole moment densities are determined. Using this data and the averaged fields we assign mesoscopic material parameters for the proposed grid structures. These parameters depend on the number of grids, and measure the averaged induced polarizations. It is demonstrated that properly loaded double grids possess polarization response that over some frequency range can be described by assigning negative values for the mesoscopic parameters. Discussion is conducted on the physical meaningfulness to assign such material parameters for thin composite slabs. The results predicted by the proposed method for the double-grid structures are compared with the results obtained using the commonly adopted S-parameter retrieval procedure.",0
"We expose first a biological model of memory based on one hand of the mechanical oscillations of axons during action potential and on the other hand on the changes in the extra cellular matrix composition when a mechanical strain is applied on it. Due to these changes, the stiffness of the extra cellular matrix along the most excited neurons will increase close to these neurons due to the growth of astrocytes around them and to the elastoplastic behavior of collagen. This will create preferential paths linked to a memory effect. In a second part, we expose a physical model based on random walk of the action potential on the array composed of dendrites and axons. This last model shows that repetition of the same event leads to long time memory of this event and that paradoxical sleep leads to the linking of different events put into memory.",0
"Powerful radio sources and quasars emit relativistic jets of plasma and magnetic fields that travel hundreds of kilo-parsecs, ultimately depositing energy into the intra- or inter-cluster medium. In the rest frame of the jet, the energy density of the cosmic microwave background is enhanced by the bulk Lorentz factor squared, and when this exceeds the magnetic energy density the primary loss mechanism of the relativistic electrons is via inverse Compton scattering. The microwave energy density is also enhanced by a factor (1+z)^4, which becomes important at large redshifts. We are using Chandra to survey a z>3 sub-sample of radio sources selected with 21 cm wavelength flux density > 70 mJy, and with a spectroscopic redshift. Out of the first 12 objects observed, there are two clear cases of the X-rays extending beyond the detectable radio jet.",0
"Brownian motion is a Gaussian process described by the central limit theorem. However, exponential decays of the positional probability density function $P(X,t)$ of packets of spreading random walkers, were observed in numerous situations that include glasses, live cells and bacteria suspensions. We show that such exponential behavior is generally valid in a large class of problems of transport in random media. By extending the Large Deviations approach for a continuous time random walk we uncover a general universal behavior for the decay of the density. It is found that fluctuations in the number of steps of the random walker, performed at finite time, lead to exponential decay (with logarithmic corrections) of $P(X,t)$. This universal behavior holds also for short times, a fact that makes experimental observations readily achievable.",0
"This paper is concerned with transition paths within the framework of the overdamped Langevin dynamics model of chemical reactions. We aim to give an efficient description of typical transition paths in the small temperature regime. We adopt a variational point of view and seek the best Gaussian approximation, with respect to Kullback-Leibler divergence, of the non-Gaussian distribution of the diffusion process. We interpret the mean of this Gaussian approximation as the """"most likely path"""" and the covariance operator as a means to capture the typical fluctuations around this most likely path. We give an explicit expression for the Kullback-Leibler divergence in terms of the mean and the covariance operator for a natural class of Gaussian approximations and show the existence of minimisers for the variational problem. Then the low temperature limit is studied via $\Gamma$-convergence of the associated variational problem. The limiting functional consists of two parts: The first part only depends on the mean and coincides with the $\Gamma$-limit of the Freidlin-Wentzell rate functional. The second part depends on both, the mean and the covariance operator and is minimized if the dynamics are given by a time-inhomogenous Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process found by linearization of the Langevin dynamics around the Freidlin-Wentzell minimizer.",0

"HDT (Header, Dictionary, Triples) is a serialization for RDF. HDT has become very popular in the last years because it allows to store RDF data with a small disk footprint, while remaining at the same time queriable. For this reason HDT is often used when scalability becomes an issue. Once RDF data is serialized into HDT, the disk footprint to store it and the memory footprint to query it are very low. However, generating HDT files from raw text RDF serializations (like N-Triples) is a time-consuming and (especially) memory-consuming task. In this publication we present HDTCat, an algorithm and command line tool to join two HDT files with low memory footprint. HDTCat can be used in a divide-and-conquer strategy to generate HDT files from huge datasets using a low-memory footprint.",0
"One-dimensional quasiperiodic systems, such as the Harper model and the Fibonacci quasicrystal, have long been the focus of extensive theoretical and experimental research. Recently, the Harper model was found to be topologically nontrivial. Here, we derive a general model that embodies a continuous deformation between these seemingly unrelated models. We show that this deformation does not close any bulk gaps, and thus prove that these models are in fact topologically equivalent. Remarkably, they are equivalent regardless of whether the quasiperiodicity appears as an on-site or hopping modulation. This proves that these different models share the same boundary phenomena and explains past measurements. We generalize this equivalence to any Fibonacci-like quasicrystal, i.e., a cut and project in any irrational angle.",0
"We consider Markov decision processes (MDP) as generators of sequences of probability distributions over states. A probability distribution is p-synchronizing if the probability mass is at least p in a single state, or in a given set of states. We consider four temporal synchronizing modes: a sequence of probability distributions is always p-synchronizing, eventually p-synchronizing, weakly p-synchronizing, or strongly p-synchronizing if, respectively, all, some, infinitely many, or all but finitely many distributions in the sequence are p-synchronizing. For each synchronizing mode, an MDP can be (i) sure winning if there is a strategy that produces a 1-synchronizing sequence; (ii) almost-sure winning if there is a strategy that produces a sequence that is, for all epsilon > 0, a (1-epsilon)-synchronizing sequence; (iii) limit-sure winning if for all epsilon > 0, there is a strategy that produces a (1-epsilon)-synchronizing sequence. We provide fundamental results on the expressiveness, decidability, and complexity of synchronizing properties for MDPs. For each synchronizing mode, we consider the problem of deciding whether an MDP is sure, almost-sure, or limit-sure winning, and we establish matching upper and lower complexity bounds of the problems: for all winning modes, we show that the problems are PSPACE-complete for eventually and weakly synchronizing, and PTIME-complete for always and strongly synchronizing. We establish the memory requirement for winning strategies, and we show that all winning modes coincide for always synchronizing, and that the almost-sure and limit-sure winning modes coincide for weakly and strongly synchronizing.",0
"We present a new atmospheric extinction curve for Mauna Kea spanning 3200--9700 \AA. It is the most comprehensive to date, being based on some 4285 standard star spectra obtained on 478 nights spread over a period of 7 years obtained by the Nearby SuperNova Factory using the SuperNova Integral Field Spectrograph. This mean curve and its dispersion can be used as an aid in calibrating spectroscopic or imaging data from Mauna Kea, and in estimating the calibration uncertainty associated with the use of a mean extinction curve. Our method for decomposing the extinction curve into physical components, and the ability to determine the chromatic portion of the extinction even on cloudy nights, is described and verified over the wide range of conditions sampled by our large dataset. We demonstrate good agreement with atmospheric science data obtain at nearby Mauna Loa Observatory, and with previously published measurements of the extinction above Mauna Kea.",0

"The goal of this paper is to serve as a guide for selecting a detection architecture that achieves the right speed/memory/accuracy balance for a given application and platform. To this end, we investigate various ways to trade accuracy for speed and memory usage in modern convolutional object detection systems. A number of successful systems have been proposed in recent years, but apples-to-apples comparisons are difficult due to different base feature extractors (e.g., VGG, Residual Networks), different default image resolutions, as well as different hardware and software platforms. We present a unified implementation of the Faster R-CNN [Ren et al., 2015], R-FCN [Dai et al., 2016] and SSD [Liu et al., 2015] systems, which we view as """"meta-architectures"""" and trace out the speed/accuracy trade-off curve created by using alternative feature extractors and varying other critical parameters such as image size within each of these meta-architectures. On one extreme end of this spectrum where speed and memory are critical, we present a detector that achieves real time speeds and can be deployed on a mobile device. On the opposite end in which accuracy is critical, we present a detector that achieves state-of-the-art performance measured on the COCO detection task.",0
"We prove a nonlinear Poisson type formula for the Schrodinger group. Such a formula had been derived in a previous paper by the authors, as a consequence of the study of the asymptotic behavior of nonlinear wave operators for small data.

Moreover, energy-critical nonlinearities are allowed.",0

This is also the global dimension of the complex algebra of the category of all epimorphisms between subsets of an $n$-set. In our proof we use standard homological methods as well as combinatorial techniques associated to the representation theory of the symmetric group. As part of the proof, we obtain a partial description of the Cartan matrix of these algebras.",0

"I present GrayStarServer (GSS), a stellar atmospheric modeling and spectrum synthesis code of pedagogical accuracy that is accessible in any web browser on commonplace computational devices and that runs on a time-scale of a few seconds. The addition of spectrum synthesis annotated with line identifications extends the functionality and pedagogical applicability of GSS beyond that of its predecessor, GrayStar3 (GS3). The spectrum synthesis is based on a line list acquired from the NIST atomic spectra database, and the GSS post-processing and user interface (UI) client allows the user to inspect the plain text ASCII version of the line list, as well as to apply macroscopic broadening. Unlike GS3, GSS carries out the physical modeling on the server side in Java, and communicates with the JavaScript and HTML client via an asynchronous HTTP request. I also describe other improvements beyond GS3 such as more realistic modeling physics and use of the HTML <canvas> element for higher quality plotting and rendering of results, and include a comparison to Phoenix modeling. I also present LineListServer, a Java code for converting custom ASCII line lists in NIST format to the byte data type file format required by GSS so that users can prepare their own custom line lists. I propose a standard for marking up and packaging model atmosphere and spectrum synthesis output for data transmission and storage that will facilitate a web-based approach to stellar atmospheric modeling and spectrum synthesis. I describe some pedagogical demonstrations and exercises enabled by easily accessible, on-demand, responsive spectrum synthesis. GSS may serve as a research support tool by providing quick spectroscopic reconnaissance. GSS may be found at www.ap.smu.ca/~ishort/OpenStars/.",0

"The goal of video-based person re-identification is to match two input videos, so that the distance of the two videos is small if two videos contain the same person. A common approach for person re-identification is to first extract image features for all frames in the video, then aggregate all the features to form a video-level feature. The video-level features of two videos can then be used to calculate the distance of the two videos. In this paper, we propose a temporal attention approach for aggregating frame-level features into a video-level feature vector for re-identification. Our method is motivated by the fact that not all frames in a video are equally informative. We propose a fully convolutional temporal attention model for generating the attention scores. Fully convolutional network (FCN) has been widely used in semantic segmentation for generating 2D output maps. In this paper, we formulate video based person re-identification as a sequence labeling problem like semantic segmentation. We establish a connection between them and modify FCN to generate attention scores to represent the importance of each frame. Extensive experiments on three different benchmark datasets (i.e. iLIDS-VID, PRID-2011 and SDU-VID) show that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.",0
"H$_3^+$ emission is the dominant cooling mechanism in Jupiter's thermosphere and a useful probe of temperature and ion densities. The H$_3^+$ ion is predicted to form in the thermospheres of close-in `hot Jupiters' where its emission would be a significant factor in the thermal energy budget, affecting temperature and the rate of hydrogen escape from the exosphere. Hot Jupiters are predicted to have up to 10$^5$ times Jupiter's H$_3^+$ emission because they experience extreme stellar irradiation and enhanced interactions may occur between the planetary magnetosphere and the stellar wind. Direct (but unresolved) detection of an extrasolar planet, or the establishment of useful upper limits, may be possible because a small but significant fraction of the total energy received by the planet is re-radiated in a few narrow lines of H$_3^+$ within which the flux from the star is limited. We present the observing strategy and results of our search for emission from the Q(1,0) transition of H$_3^+$ (3.953~$\mu$m) from extrasolar planets orbiting six late-type dwarfs using CSHELL, the high-resolution echelle spectrograph on NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF). We exploited the time-dependent Doppler shift of the planet, which can be as large as 150 km s$^{-1}$, by differencing spectra between nights, thereby removing the stellar photospheric signal and telluric lines. We set limits on the H$_3^+$ emission from each of these systems and compare them with models in the literature. Ideal candidates for future searches are intrinsically faint stars, such as M dwarfs, at very close distances.",0
"We report a new system of artificial life called Lenia (from Latin lenis """"smooth""""), a two-dimensional cellular automaton with continuous space-time-state and generalized local rule. Computer simulations show that Lenia supports a great diversity of complex autonomous patterns or """"lifeforms"""" bearing resemblance to real-world microscopic organisms. More than 400 species in 18 families have been identified, many discovered via interactive evolutionary computation. They differ from other cellular automata patterns in being geometric, metameric, fuzzy, resilient, adaptive, and rule-generic. We present basic observations of the system regarding the properties of space-time and basic settings. We provide a broad survey of the lifeforms, categorize them into a hierarchical taxonomy, and map their distribution in the parameter hyperspace. We describe their morphological structures and behavioral dynamics, propose possible mechanisms of their self-propulsion, self-organization and plasticity. Finally, we discuss how the study of Lenia would be related to biology, artificial life, and artificial intelligence.",0

We underline that the result fully parallels the corresponding parabolic-elliptic-ODE system.",0
"In a complex scattering system with few open channels, say a quantum dot with leads, the correlation properties of the poles of the scattering matrix are most directly related to the internal dynamics of the system. We may ask how to extract these properties from an analysis of cross sections. In general this is very difficult, if we leave the domain of isolated resonances. We propose to consider the cross correlation function of two different elastic or total cross sections. For these we can show numerically and to some extent also analytically a significant dependence on the correlations between the scattering poles. The difference between uncorrelated and strongly correlated poles is clearly visible, even for strongly overlapping resonances.",0
"Multi-scale deep CNN architecture [1, 2, 3] successfully captures both fine and coarse level image descriptors for visual similarity task, but they come up with expensive memory overhead and latency. In this paper, we propose a competing novel CNN architecture, called MILDNet, which merits by being vastly compact (about 3 times). Inspired by the fact that successive CNN layers represent the image with increasing levels of abstraction, we compressed our deep ranking model to a single CNN by coupling activations from multiple intermediate layers along with the last layer. Trained on the famous Street2shop dataset [4], we demonstrate that our approach performs as good as the current state-of-the-art models with only one third of the parameters, model size, training time and significant reduction in inference time. The significance of intermediate layers on image retrieval task has also been shown to be performing on popular datasets Holidays, Oxford, Paris [5]. So even though our experiments are done on ecommerce domain, it is applicable to other domains as well. We further did an ablation study to validate our hypothesis by checking the impact on adding each intermediate layer. With this we also present two more useful variants of MILDNet, a mobile model (12 times smaller) for on-edge devices and a compactly featured model (512-d feature embeddings) for systems with less RAMs and to reduce the ranking cost. Further we present an intuitive way to automatically create a tailored in-house triplet training dataset, which is very hard to create manually. This solution too can also be deployed as an all-inclusive visual similarity solution. Finally, we present our entire production level architecture which currently powers visual similarity at Fynd.",0
"Ability for accurate hospital case cost modelling and prediction is critical for efficient health care financial management and budgetary planning. A variety of regression machine learning algorithms are known to be effective for health care cost predictions. The purpose of this experiment was to build an Azure Machine Learning Studio tool for rapid assessment of multiple types of regression models. The tool offers environment for comparing 14 types of regression models in a unified experiment: linear regression, Bayesian linear regression, decision forest regression, boosted decision tree regression, neural network regression, Poisson regression, Gaussian processes for regression, gradient boosted machine, nonlinear least squares regression, projection pursuit regression, random forest regression, robust regression, robust regression with mm-type estimators, support vector regression. The tool presents assessment results arranged by model accuracy in a single table using five performance metrics. Evaluation of regression machine learning models for performing hospital case cost prediction demonstrated advantage of robust regression model, boosted decision tree regression and decision forest regression. The operational tool has been published to the web and openly available for experiments and extensions.",0
"We study finitely generated nilpotent groups $G$ given by full rank finite presentations $\langle A \mid R\rangle$ in the variety $\mathcal{N}_c$ of nilpotent groups of class at most $c$, where $c \geq 2$. We prove that if the deficiency $|A| - |R| $ is at least $2$ then the group $G$ is virtually free nilpotent, it is quasi finitely axiomatizable (in particular, first-order rigid), and it is almost (up to finite factors) directly indecomposable. One of the main results of the paper is that the Diophantine problem in nilpotent groups given by full rank finite presentations $\langle A \mid R\rangle$ is undecidable if $|A| - |R| \geq 2$ and decidable otherwise. We show that this class of groups is rather large since finite presentations asymptotically almost surely have full rank, so a random nilpotent group in the few relators model has a full rank presentation asymptotically almost surely. Full rank presentations give one a useful tool to approach random nilpotent groups and study their properties. Note, that the results above significantly improve our understanding of the Diophantine problem in finitely generated nilpotent groups: from a few special examples of groups with undecidable Diophantine problem we got to the place where we know that the Diophantine problem in all """"typical"""" nilpotent groups is also undecidable.",0
"RPA correlations, spectral function and 2p2h (multi-nucleon) effects on charged-current neutrino-nucleus reactions without emitted pions are discussed. We pay attention to the influence of RPA and multi-nucleon mechanisms on the MiniBooNE and MINERvA flux folded differential cross sections, the MiniBooNE flux unfolded total cross section and the neutrino energy reconstruction.",0
"We prove that for any group G in a fairly large class of generalized wreath product groups, the associated von Neumann algebra L(G) completely """"remembers"""" the group G. More precisely, if L(G) is isomorphic to the von Neumann algebra L(\Lambda) of an arbitrary countable group \Lambda, then \Lambda\ must be isomorphic to G. This represents the first superrigidity result pertaining to group von Neumann algebras.",0
"A proposal for a three-year program of charm and QCD physics with the CLEO detector operating in the range of sqrt{s} = 3 - 5 GeV is presented. The CLEO-c program will include studies of semileptonic and hadronic charm decays, as well as searches for gluonic matter in the area of nonpertubative QCD. In addition, spectroscopy of the Upsilon(1S), Upsilon(2S) and Upsilon(3S) resonances is being carried out prior to the CLEO-c program.",0
"Loops are abundant in native RNA structures and proliferate close to the unfolding transition. By including a statistical weight ~ l^{-c} for loops of length l in the recursion relation for the partition function, we show that the calculated heat capacity depends sensitively on the presence and value of the exponent c, even of short t-RNA. For homo-RNA we analytically calculate the critical temperature and critical exponents which exhibit a non-universal dependence on c.",0
"The subpath planning problem is a branch of the path planning problem, which has widespread applications in automated manufacturing process as well as vehicle and robot navigation. This problem is to find the shortest path or tour subject for travelling a set of given subpaths. The current approaches for dealing with the subpath planning problem are all based on meta-heuristic approaches. It is well-known that meta-heuristic based approaches have several deficiencies. To address them, we propose a novel approximation algorithm in the O(n^3) time complexity class, which guarantees to solve any subpath planning problem instance with the fixed ratio bound of 2. Also, the formal proofs of the claims, our empirical evaluation shows that our approximation method acts much better than a state-of-the-art method, both in result and execution time.",0
"Although it is widely accepted that photospheric motions provide the energy source and that the magnetic field must play a key role in the process, the detailed mechanisms responsible for heating the Sun's corona and accelerating the solar wind are still not fully understood. Cranmer et al. (2007) developed a sophisticated, 1D, time-steady model of the solar wind with turbulence dissipation. By varying the coronal magnetic field, they obtain, for a single choice of wave properties, a realistic range of slow and fast wind conditions with a sharp latitudinal transition between the two streams. Using a 1D, time-dependent model of the solar wind of Lionello et al. (2014), which incorporates turbulent dissipation of Alfv\'en waves to provide heating and acceleration of the plasma, we have explored a similar configuration, obtaining qualitatively equivalent results. However, our calculations suggest that the rapid transition between slow and fast wind suggested by this 1D model may be disrupted in multidimensional MHD simulations by the requirement of transverse force balance.",0
"The issue of texture specific mass matrices has been discussed by incorporating Weak Basis transformations and the concept of `naturalness'. Interestingly, we find that starting from the most general mass matrices, one can arrive at texture four zero mass matrices which can fit both quark as well as lepton mixing data and are similar to the original Fritzsch ansatze.",0
"Understanding the nature of electrical conductivity, superconductivity and magnetism between layers of oxides is of immense importance for the design of electronic devices employing oxide heterostructures. We demonstrate that resonant inelastic X-ray scattering can be applied to directly probe the carriers in oxide heterostructures. Our investigation on epitaxially grown LaAlO3/SrTiO3 superlattices unambiguously reveals the presence of both localized and delocalized Ti 3d carriers. These two types of carriers are caused by oxygen vacancies and electron transfer due to the polar discontinuity at the interface. This result allows explaining the reported discrepancy between theoretically calculated and experimentally measured carrier density values in LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures.",0
"Recently, Gimbutas et al derived an elegant representation for the Green's functions of Stokes flow in a half-space. We present a fast summation method for sums involving these half-space Green's functions (stokeslets, stresslets and rotlets) that consolidates and builds on the work by Klinteberg et al for the corresponding free-space Green's functions. The fast method is based on two main ingredients: The Ewald decomposition and subsequent use of FFTs. The Ewald decomposition recasts the sum into a sum of two exponentially decaying series: one in real-space (short-range interactions) and one in Fourier-space (long-range interactions) with the convergence of each series controlled by a common parameter. The evaluation of short-range interactions is accelerated by restricting computations to neighbours within a specified distance, while the use of FFTs accelerates the computations in Fourier-space thus accelerating the overall sum. We demonstrate that while the method incurs extra costs for the half-space in comparison to the free-space evaluation, greater computational savings is also achieved when compared to their respective direct sums.",0
"Isoperimetric inequalities have been studied since antiquity, and in recent decades they have been studied extensively on discrete objects, such as the hypercube. An important special case of this problem involves bounding the size of the shadow of a set system, and the basic question was solved by Kruskal (in 1963) and Katona (in 1968). In this paper we introduce the concept of the shadow \d\G of a collection \G of ordered graphs, and prove the following, simple-sounding statement: if n \in \N is sufficiently large, |V(G)| = n for each G \in \G, and |\G| < n, then |\d \G| \ge |\G|. As a consequence, we substantially strengthen a result of Balogh, Bollob\'as and Morris on hereditary properties of ordered graphs: we show that if \P is such a property, and |\P_k| < k for some sufficiently large k \in \N, then |\P_n| is decreasing for k \le n < \infty.",0
"In this paper, we consider a Dirichlet process mixture of spatial skew-$t$ processes that can flexibly model the extremes as well as the bulk, with separate parameters controlling spatial dependence in these two parts of the distribution. The proposed model has nonstationary mean and covariance structure and also nonzero spatial asymptotic dependence. Max-stable processes are theoretically justified model for station-wise block maximums or threshold exceedances in the spatial extremes literature. Considering a high threshold leads to somewhat arbitrary decision about what counts as extreme, and more importantly, it disallows the possibility that events that are large but deemed insufficiently extreme can enter into the analysis at all. Probabilistic clustering of the extreme observations and allowing extremal dependence for the cluster of extremes is a solution that is explored here. Inference is drawn based on Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. A simulation study demonstrates that the proposed model has better spatial prediction performance compared to some competing models. We develop spatial maps of extreme Fosberg Fire Weather Index (FFWI), a fire threat index and discuss the wildfire risk throughout the Santa Ana region of California.",0
"The control of matter properties (transport, magnetic, dielectric,...) using synthesis as thin films is strongly hindered by the lack of reliable theories, able to guide the design of new systems, through the understanding of the interface effects and of the way the substrate constraints are imposed to the material. The present paper analyses the energetic contributions at the interfaces, and proposes a model describing the microscopic mechanisms governing the interactions at an epitaxial interface between a manganite and another transition metal oxide in perovskite structure (as for instance $\rm SrTiO_3$). The model is checked against experimental results and literature analysis.",0
"We discuss the notion of nonequilibrium chemical potential in gases of non-interacting active particles filling two compartments separated by a potential energy barrier. Different types of active particles are considered: run-and-tumble particles, active Brownian particles, and active Brownian particles with a stochastic reorientation along an external field. After recalling some analytical results for run-and-rumble particles in one dimension, we focus on the two-dimensional case and obtain a perturbative expression of the density profile in the limit of a fast reorientation dynamics, for the three models of active particles mentioned above. Computing the chemical potentials of the non-equilibrium systems in contact from the knowledge of the stationary probability distribution of the whole system ---which agrees with a recently proposed general definition of the chemical potential in non-equilibrium systems in contact--- we generically find that the chemical potential lacks an equation of state, in the sense that it depends on the detailed shape of the potential energy barrier separating the compartments and not only on bulk properties, at odds with equilibrium. This situation is reminiscent of the properties of the mechanical pressure in active systems. We also argue that the Maxwell relation is no longer valid and cannot be used to infer the nonequilibrium chemical potential from the knowledge of the mechanical pressure.",0
"We describe a novel spiking neural network (SNN) for automated, real-time handwritten digit classification and its implementation on a GP-GPU platform. Information processing within the network, from feature extraction to classification is implemented by mimicking the basic aspects of neuronal spike initiation and propagation in the brain. The feature extraction layer of the SNN uses fixed synaptic weight maps to extract the key features of the image and the classifier layer uses the recently developed NormAD approximate gradient descent based supervised learning algorithm for spiking neural networks to adjust the synaptic weights. On the standard MNIST database images of handwritten digits, our network achieves an accuracy of 99.80% on the training set and 98.06% on the test set, with nearly 7x fewer parameters compared to the state-of-the-art spiking networks. We further use this network in a GPU based user-interface system demonstrating real-time SNN simulation to infer digits written by different users. On a test set of 500 such images, this real-time platform achieves an accuracy exceeding 97% while making a prediction within an SNN emulation time of less than 100ms.",0
"We report the first observation of the decay $B^+ \to \chi_{c0} K^+$ using 21.3 fb$^{-1}$ of data collected by the Belle detector at the $\Upsilon$(4S) resonance. The preliminary result for the branching fraction is ${\cal{B}}(B^+\to \chi_{c0}K^+)=(8.0^{+2.7}_{-2.4}\pm 1.0\pm 1.1)\times 10^{-4}$ where the first error is statistical, the second is systematic, and the third comes from the uncertainty in the $\chi_{c0}\to\pi^+\pi^-$ branching fraction.",0
"We improve the existing calculations of deep inelastic scattering to next to next to leading order in the following manner. First, we use the recently calculated values of the anomalous dimensions for moments with index n=10,12 in ep scattering. Second, we use also recently calculated anomalous dimensions for n=1,3,...,13 for xF3 in neutrino N scattering, to extend the calculation to this process. Lastly, we use the determinantal constraints on the moments that follow from positivity of the structure functions to stabilize the fits. We find substantial improvement over previous results, getting the following numbers: Lambda(n_f=4, 3 loops)= 274 \pm 20 MeV, alpha_s^{3 loops}(M_Z^2)=0.1166 \pm 0.0013 and chi^2/dof= 92/(153-18) from ep and, from \nu N, Lambda(n_f=4, 3 loops)=255 \pm 72 MeV, alpha_s^{3 loops}(M_Z^2)=0.1153 \pm 0.0063 and chi^2/dof=0.335/(64-7). The errors take into account experimental errors and higher twist effects among other estimated theoretical errors. We can also extrapolate the fit, made originally for the range 3.5 < Q^2 < 230 GeV^2 to higher momenta, obtaining very good reproduction of experimental data up to Q^2=5000 GeV^2. From this, in particular, we can exclude supersymmetric partners (squarks or gluinos) for masses up to some 60 GeV. The fitted value of the coupling is now, including the data at high Q^2, alpha_s^{3 loops}(M_Z^2)=0.1163 \pm 0.0014.",0
"We investigate the pulsational stability of massive (M >~ 120 Msun) main sequence stars of a range of metallicities, including primordial, Population III stars. We include a formulation of convective damping motivated by numerical simulations of the interaction between convection and periodic shear flows. We find that convective viscosity is likely strong enough to stabilize radial pulsations whenever nuclear-burning (the epsilon-mechanism) is the dominant source of driving. This suggests that massive main sequence stars with Z <~ 2 x 10^-3 are pulsationally stable and are unlikely to experience pulsation-driven mass loss on the main sequence. These conclusions are, however, sensitive to the form of the convective viscosity and highlight the need for further high-resolution simulations of the convection-oscillation interaction. For more metal-rich stars (Z >~ 2 x 10^-3), the dominant pulsational driving arises due to the kappa-mechanism arising from the iron-bump in opacity and is strong enough to overcome convective damping. Our results highlight that even for oscillations with periods a few orders of magnitude shorter than the outer convective turnover time, the """"frozen-in"""" approximation for the convection-oscillation interaction is inappropriate, and convective damping should be taken into account when assessing mode stability.",0
"Following Blumenthal \etl \cite{blu} and Piran \etl \cite{Pi} I discuss a simple model for the gravitational formation of voids. This model enables us to estimate the primordial perturbation required on the scale of voids. A comparison of this condition with the constraints on the spectrum of fluctuations derived from CMBR observations reveals that gravitational growth of large voids require more power on the scale of $\approx 1500$\kms than is generally accepted in CDM models. For a generic power law primordial spectrum $P(k) \propto k^n$ gravitational growth of voids requires $n \gsim 1.25$, which is marginally compatible with the observed CMBR fluctuations. If future measurements will show that the amplitude of fluctuations required to produce the voids is too large they will imply that the voids did not grow gravitationally and that galaxies do not trace matter on very large scale.",0
"We solve isotropic, homogeneous cosmological models containing a self-interacting scalar field. Calculations are performed in four and two-dimensional spacetimes. We find several exact solutions that have an inflationary regime or has a final Friedmann stage. Also their asymptotically stability is studied.",0
"The present status of double beta decay experiments (including the search for $2\beta^{+}$, EC$\beta^{+}$ and ECEC processes) are reviewed. The results of the most sensitive experiments are discussed. Average and recommended half-life values for two-neutrino double beta decay are presented. Conservative upper limits on effective Majorana neutrino mass and the coupling constant of the Majoron to the neutrino are established as $<m_{\nu} > < 0.75$ eV and $<g_{ee} > < 1.9 \cdot 10^{-4}$, respectively. Proposals for future double beta decay experiments with a sensitivity for the $<m_{\nu}>$ at the level of (0.01-0.1) eV are considered.",0
"The electromagnetic form factors of strange mesons and baryons are studied by means of kaon electroproduction on the nucleon. The response functions that are sensitive to the K0, Lambda, Sigma, and KK*\gamma transition form factors are systematically explored. The effects of these form factors on several response functions are discussed.",0
"In this work, we present a bilinear Tb theorem for singular integral operators of Calder\'on-Zygmund type. We prove some new accretive type Littlewood-Paley theory and bilinear paraproduct for a para-accretive function setting. We also introduce a criterion for extending certain Lp Clader\'on reproducing formulas to convergence in H1.",0
"We provide a finite-dimensional model of the twisted K-group twisted by any degree three integral cohomology class of a CW complex. One key to the model is Furuta's generalized vector bundle, and the other is a finite-dimensional approximation of Fredholm operators.",0
"We present the first characterisation of the 12um warm dust (""""exo-Zodi"""") luminosity function around Sun-like stars, focussing on the dustiest systems that can be identified by WISE. We detect six new warm dust candidates, five of which have unknown ages. We show that the dustiest old (>Gyr) systems like BD+20 307 are 1 in 10,000 occurrences. Bright warm dust is more common around young (<120Myr) systems, with a ~1% occurrence rate. We show that a two component in situ model where all stars have initially massive warm disks and in which warm debris is also generated at some random time along the stars' main-sequence lifetime, perhaps due to a collision, can explain the observations. However, if all stars only have initially massive warm disks these would not be visible at Gyr ages, and random collisions on the main-sequence are too infrequent to explain the high disk occurrence rate for young stars. That is, neither component can explain the observations on their own. Despite these conclusions, we cannot rule out an alternative model in which comets are scattered from outer regions because the distribution of systems with the appropriate dynamics is unknown. Our in situ model predicts the fraction of stars with exo-Zodi bright enough to cause problems for future exo-Earth imaging attempts is at least ~10%, and is higher for populations of stars younger than a few Gyr. This prediction of ~10% applies to old stars because bright systems like BD+20 307 imply a population of fainter systems that were once bright but are now decaying through fainter levels. Our prediction should be strongly tested by the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer, providing valuable input for more detailed evolution models. A detection fraction lower than our prediction could indicate that the hot dust in systems like BD+20 307 has a cometary origin due to the quirks of the planetary dynamics.",0
"We study the relationship between social media output and National Football League (NFL) games, using a dataset containing messages from Twitter and NFL game statistics. Specifically, we consider tweets pertaining to specific teams and games in the NFL season and use them alongside statistical game data to build predictive models for future game outcomes (which team will win?) and sports betting outcomes (which team will win with the point spread? will the total points be over/under the line?). We experiment with several feature sets and find that simple features using large volumes of tweets can match or exceed the performance of more traditional features that use game statistics.",0
"We consider the cohomological Hall algebra Y of a Lagrangian substack of the moduli stack of representations of the preprojective algebra of an arbitrary quiver Q, and its actions on the cohomology of quiver varieties. We conjecture that Y is equal, after a suitable extension of scalars, to the Yangian introduced by Maulik and Okounkov, and we construct an embedding of Y in the Yangian, intertwining the respective actions of both algebras on the cohomology of quiver varieties.",0
"Using Stein's method techniques, we develop a framework which allows one to bound the error terms arising from approximation by the Laplace distribution and apply it to the study of random sums of mean zero random variables. As a corollary, we deduce a Berry-Esseen type theorem for the convergence of certain geometric sums. Our results make use of a second order characterizing equation and a distributional transformation which is related to zero-biasing.",0
"Young OB associations with masses greater than 10$^4$ M$_{\sun}$ have been inferred to exist in the Galaxy but have largely evaded detection. Recently, a candidate OB association has been identified within the most luminous star forming complex in the Galaxy, the Dragonfish Nebula. We identify 18 young, massive stars with near-infrared spectroscopy from a sample of 50 members within the candidate OB association, including 15 O-type, and three Luminous Blue Variables or Wolf-Rayet stars. This number matches the expected yield of massive stars from the candidate association, confirming its existence and ability to power the parent star forming complex. These results demonstrate the existence of a 10$^5$ M$_{\sun}$ OB association, more powerful than any previously known in the Galaxy, comparable in mass only to Westerlund 1. Further, the results also validate the color selection method used to identify the association, adding credence to others discovered in the same way.",0
"It is pointed out that Coleman and Van Vleck make a major blunder in their discussion of the Shockly-James paradox by designating relativistic hidden mechanical momentum as the basis for resolution of the paradox. This blunder has had a wide influence in the current physics literature, including erroneous work on the Shockley-James paradox, on Mansuripur's paradox, on the motion of a magnetic moment, on the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift, and on the Aharonov-Casher phase shift. Although hidden mechanical momentum is indeed dominant for non-interacting particles moving in a closed orbit under the influence of an external electric field, the attention directed toward hidden mechanical momentum represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the classical electromagnetic interaction between a multiparticle magnet and an external point charge. In the interacting multiparticle situation, the external charge induces an electrostatic polarization of the magnet which leads to an internal electromagnetic momentum in the magnet where both the electric and magnetic fields for the momentum are contributed by the magnet particles. This internal electromagnetic momentum for the interacting multiparticle situation is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction compared to the familiar external electromagnetic momentum where the electric field is contributed by the external charged particle and the magnetic field is that due to the magnet. In the present article, the momentum balance of the Shockley-James situation for a system of a magnet and a point charge is calculated in detail for a magnet model consisting of two interacting point charges which are constrained to move in a circular orbit on a frictionless ring with a compensating negative charge at the center.",0
"Scalar mesons are a key expression of the strong physics regime of QCD and the role condensates, particularly $<q{\bar q}>$, play in breaking chiral symmetry. What new insights have been provided by recent experiments on $D, D_s$ and $J/\psi$ decays to light hadrons is discussed. We need to establish whether all the claimed scalars $\sigma$, $\kappa$, $f_0(1370)$, etc., really exist and with what parameters before we can meaningfully speculate further about which is transiently ${\bar q}q$, ${\bar{qq}} qq$, multi-meson molecule or largely glue.",0
"A Bayesian net (BN) is more than a succinct way to encode a probabilistic distribution; it also corresponds to a function used to answer queries. A BN can therefore be evaluated by the accuracy of the answers it returns. Many algorithms for learning BNs, however, attempt to optimize another criterion (usually likelihood, possibly augmented with a regularizing term), which is independent of the distribution of queries that are posed. This paper takes the """"performance criteria"""" seriously, and considers the challenge of computing the BN whose performance - read """"accuracy over the distribution of queries"""" - is optimal. We show that many aspects of this learning task are more difficult than the corresponding subtasks in the standard model.",0
"BPS equations and wall solutions are studied keeping (part of) supersymmetry (SUSY) manifest. Using N=1 superfields, massive hyper-Kahler quotient is introduced to obtain massive N=2 (8 SUSY) nonlinear sigma models in four dimensions with T*CP(n) target manifold, which yield BPS wall solutions for the n=1 case. We also describe massive hyper-Kahler quotient of T*CP(n) by using the harmonic superspace formalism which preserves all SUSY manifestly, and BPS equations and wall solutions are obtained in the n=1 case.",0
"We prove a homological stability theorem for certain complements of symmetric spaces. This is a variant of a conjecture by Vakil and Matchett Wood for subspaces of $\mathrm{Sym}^n(X)$ where $X$ is an open manifold admitting a boundary. To do this we prove a homological stability result for a type of """"coloured"""" configuration space by adding points of the same colour.",0
"The coboundary expansion generalizes the classical graph expansion to the case of the general simplicial complexes, and allows the definition of the higher-dimensional Cheeger constants $h_k(X)$ for an arbitrary simplicial complex $X$, and any $k\geq 0$. In this paper we investigate the value of $h_1(\Delta^{[n]})$ - the first Cheeger constant of a simplex with $n$ vertices. It is known, due to the pioneering work of Meshulam and Wallach, that \[\lceil n/3\rceil\geq h_1(\Delta^{[n]})\geq n/3, \textrm{ for all } n,\] and that the equality $h_1(\Delta^{[n]})=n/3$ is achieved when $n$ is divisible by $3$. Here we expand on these results. First, we show that \[h_1(\Delta^{[n]})=n/3, \textrm{ whenever }n\textrm{ is not a power of }2.\] So the sharp equality holds on a set whose density goes to $1$. Second, we show that \[h_1(\Delta^{[n]})=n/3+O(1/n),\textrm{ when }n\textrm{ is a power of }2.\] In other words, as $n$ goes to infinity, the value $h_1(\Delta^{[n]})-n/3$ is either $0$ or goes to $0$ very rapidly. Our methods include recasting the original question in purely graph-theoretic language, followed by a detailed investigation of a specific graph family, the so-called {\it staircase graphs}. These are defined by associating a graph to every partition, and appear to be especially suited to gain information about the first Cheeger constant of a simplex.",0
"Rolling Horizon Evolutionary Algorithms (RHEA) are a class of online planning methods for real-time game playing; their performance is closely related to the planning horizon and the search time allowed. In this paper, we propose to learn a prior for RHEA in an offline manner by training a value network and a policy network. The value network is used to reduce the planning horizon by providing an estimation of future rewards, and the policy network is used to initialize the population, which helps to narrow down the search scope. The proposed algorithm, named prior-based RHEA (p-RHEA), trains policy and value networks by performing planning and learning iteratively. In the planning stage, the horizon-limited search assisted with the policy network and value network is performed to improve the policies and collect training samples. In the learning stage, the policy network and value network are trained with the collected samples to learn better prior knowledge. Experimental results on OpenAI Gym MuJoCo tasks show that the performance of the proposed p-RHEA is significantly improved compared to that of RHEA.",0
"We investigate spherically symmetric, static matter configurations with polytropic equation of state for a class of f(R) models in Palatini formalism and show that the surface singularities recently reported in the literature are not physical in the case of Planck scale modified lagrangians. In such cases, they are just an artifact of the idealized equation of state used. In fact, we show that for the models f(R)=R\pm\lambda R^2, with \lambda on the order of the Planck length squared, the presence of a single electron in the Universe would be enough to cure all stellar singularities of this type. From our analysis it also follows that the stellar structure derived from these lagrangians is virtually undistinguishable from that corresponding to General Relativity. For ultraviolet corrected models far from the Planck scale, however, the surface singularities may indeed arise in the region of validity of the polytropic equation of state. This fact can be used to place constraints on the parameters of particular models.",0
"This paper establishes an analogue of the special chain theorem for the embedding dimension of polynomial rings, with direct application on the (embedding) codimension. In particular, we recover a classic result on the transfer of regularity to polynomial rings (initially proved via a combination of Serre's result on finite global dimension and Hilbert theorem on syzygies). A second application characterizes regularity in general settings of localizations of polynomial rings, including Nagata rings and Serre's conjecture rings.",0
"In this paper we investigate partial spreads of $H(2n-1,q^2)$ through the related notion of partial spread sets of hermitian matrices, and the more general notion of constant rank-distance sets. We prove a tight upper bound on the maximum size of a linear constant rank-distance set of hermitian matrices over finite fields, and as a consequence prove the maximality of extensions of symplectic semifield spreads as partial spreads of $H(2n-1,q^2)$. We prove upper bounds for constant rank-distance sets for even rank, construct large examples of these, and construct maximal partial spreads of $H(3,q^2)$ for a range of sizes.",0
"According to Harada and Sasa [Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 130602 (2005)], heat production generated in a non-equilibrium steady state can be inferred from measuring response and correlation functions. In many colloidal systems, however, it is a nontrivial task to determine response functions, whereas details about spatial steady state trajectories are easily accessible. Using a simple conditional averaging procedure, we show how this fact can be exploited to reliably evaluate average heat production. We test this method using Brownian dynamics simulations, and apply it to experimental data of an interacting driven colloidal system.",0
"Since its proposal, the idea to vastly increase data storage density with a magnetic non-volatile 3D shift-register has sustained interest in current-induced domain wall (DW) motion. So far, experimental efforts have focused on flat nanostrips, which exhibit a wide range of noteworthy effects, yet suffer from intrinsic DW instabilities limiting their mobility. In contrast, ferromagnetic cylindrical nanowires (NWs) can host a novel type of magnetic DW, namely the Bloch-point wall (BPW), which due to its specific 3D topology should not experience the same fundamental issue. This could give rise to DW velocities over ~1000 m/s and fascinating new physics including coupling to magnetic spin waves, however, experimental evidence of DW dynamics in NWs is lacking until now. Here we report experimental results on current-induced DW motion in NWs with velocities >600 m/s, quantitatively consistent with predictions. Furthermore, our results indicate that although previously disregarded, the OErsted field induced by the current plays instead a crucial and valuable role in stabilising exclusively BPWs.",0
"We consider the three-receiver Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channel with an arbitrary number of antennas at each of the transmitter and the receivers. We investigate the degrees-of-freedom (DoF) region of the channel when each receiver requests a private message, and may know some of the messages requested by the other receivers as receiver message side information (RMSI). We establish the DoF region of the channel for all 16 possible non-isomorphic RMSI configurations by deriving tight inner and outer bounds on the region. To derive the inner bounds, we first propose a scheme for each RMSI configuration which exploits both the null space and the side information of the receivers. We then use these schemes in conjunction with time sharing for 15 RMSI configurations, and with time sharing and two-symbol extension for the remaining one. To derive the outer bounds, we construct enhanced versions of the channel for each RMSI configuration, and upper bound their DoF region. After establishing the DoF region, in the case where all the nodes have the same number of antennas, we introduce some common properties of the DoF region, and the capacity region of the index coding problem.",0
"We study the possibility that galactic rotation curves can be explained by a gravitational potential that contains a linear term as well as a Newtonian one. This hypothesis, suggested by conformal gravity, does allow good fits to the galactic rotation curves of the galaxies we study, which have a wide range of luminosities. However, the universality one might have expected of the parameter describing the strength of the linear potential does not emerge. Instead, a different regularity is seen.",0
"We present CO J=4-3 line and 3 mm dust continuum observations of a 100 kpc-scale filamentary Ly{\alpha} nebula (SSA22 LAB18) at z=3.1 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). We detected the CO J=4-3 line at a systemic z(CO)=3.093 {\pm} 0.001 at 11 {\sigma} from one of the ALMA continuum sources associated with the Ly{\alpha} filament. We estimated the CO J=4-3 luminosity of L'CO(4-3)=(2.3\pm0.2)x10^9 K km s^{-1} pc^2 for this CO source, which is one order of magnitude smaller than those of typical z>1 dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) of similar far-infrared luminosity L(IR)~10^{12} Lsun. We derived a molecular gas mass of Mgas=(4.4^{+0.9}_{-0.6})x10^9 Msun and a star-formation rate of SFR=270\pm160 Msun yr^{-1}. We also estimated a gas depletion time of {\tau}(dep)=17\pm10 Myr, being shorter than those of typical DSFGs. It is suggested that this source is in a transition phase from DSFG to a gas-poor, early-type galaxy. From ALMA to Herschel multi-band dust continuum observations, we measured a dust emissivity index {\beta}=2.3\pm0.2, which is similar to those of local gas-poor, early-type galaxies. Such a high {\beta} can be reproduced by specific chemical compositions for interstellar dust at the submillimeter wavelengths from recent laboratory experiments. ALMA CO and multi-band dust continuum observations can constrain the evolutionary stage of high-redshift galaxies through {\tau}(dep) and {\beta}, and thus we can investigate dust chemical compositions even in the early Universe.",0
"The lack of specificity in microarray experiments due to non-specific hybridization raises a serious problem for the analysis of microarray data because the residual chemical background intensity is not related to the expression degree of the gene of interest. We analyzed the concentration dependence of the signal intensity of perfect match (PM) and mismatch (MM) probes in terms using a microscopic binding model using a combination of mean hybridization isotherms and single base related affinity terms. The signal intensities of the PM and MM probes and their difference are assessed with regard to their sensitivity, specificity and resolution for gene expression measures. The presented theory implies the refinement of existing algorithms of probe level analysis to correct microarray data for non-specific background intensities.",0
"We quantitatively investigate the non-classicality and non-locality of a whole new class of mixed disparate quantum and semiquantum photon sources at the quantum-classical boundary. The latter include photon added thermal and photon added coherent sources, experimentally investigated recently by Zavatta et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 140406 (2009)]. The key quantity in our investigations is the visibility of the corresponding photon-photon correlation function. We present explicit results on the violations of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality - which is a measure of nonclassicality - as well as of Bell-type inequalities.",0
"We develop our method to prove quantum superintegrability of an integrable 2D system, based on recurrence relations obeyed by the eigenfunctions of the system with respect to separable coordinates. We show that the method provides rigorous proofs of superintegrability and explicit constructions of higher order generators for the symmetry algebra. We apply the method to 5 families of systems, each depending on a parameter $k$, including most notably the caged anisotropic oscillator, the Tremblay, Turbiner and Winternitz system and a deformed Kepler-Coulomb system, and we give proofs of quantum superintegrability for all rational values of $k$, new for 4 of these systems. In addition, we show that the explicit information supplied by the special function recurrence relations allows us to prove, for the first time in 4 cases, that the symmetry algebra generated by our lowest order symmetries closes and to determine the associated structure equations of the algebras for each $k$. We have no proof that our generating symmetries are of lowest possible order, but we have no counterexamples, and we are confident we can can always find any missing generators from our raising and lowering operator recurrences. We also get for free, one variable models of the action of the symmetry algebra in terms of difference operators. We describe how the St\""""ackel transform acts and show that it preserves the structure equations.",0
Resonant coupling between plasmonic nanoantennas and molecular vibrational excitations is employed to amplify the weak overtone transitions that reside in the near-infrared. We explore for the first time the differential extinction of forbidden molecular overtone transitions coupled to the localized surface plasmons. We show that a non-trivial interplay between the molecular absorption enhancement and suppression of plasmonic absorption in a coupled system gives rise to orders of magnitude enhancement of the probe molecule differential extinction. Our results pave a road toward a new class of surface-enhanced near-infrared absorption-based sensors.,0
"We report the fabrication of a superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SSPD or SNSPD) with an ultralow dark count rate. By introducing optical band-pass filters at the input of the SSPD and cooling the filters at 3 K, the dark count rate is reduced to less than 1/100 at low bias. An SSPD with 0.1 cps dark count rate and 5.6% system detection efficiency at 1550 nm wavelength is obtained. We show that a quantum key distribution (QKD) over 300 km of fiber is possible based on a numerical calculation assuming a differential phase shift QKD protocol implemented with our SSPDs.",0
The effective action for 2d-gravity in Weyl-invariant regularization is extended to supersymmetric case. The super area-preserving invariance and cocyclic properties under general supergravitational transformations of the last action is shown.,0
"We study an invariant of dynamical systems called naive entropy, which is defined for both measurable and topological actions of any countable group. We focus on nonamenable groups, in which case the invariant is two-valued, with every system having naive entropy either zero or infinity. Bowen has conjectured that when the acting group is sofic, zero naive entropy implies sofic entropy at most zero for both types of systems. We prove the topological version of this conjecture by showing that for every action of a sofic group by homeomorphisms of a compact metric space, zero naive entropy implies sofic entropy at most zero. This result and the simple definition of naive entropy allow us to show that the generic action of a free group on the Cantor set has sofic entropy at most zero. We observe that a distal $\Gamma$-system has zero naive entropy in both senses, if $\Gamma$ has an element of infinite order. We also show that the naive entropy of a topological system is greater than or equal to the naive measure entropy of the same system with respect to any invariant measure.",0
The Lagrange-mesh method is a very accurate procedure to compute eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a two-body quantum equation. The method requires only the evaluation of the potential at some mesh points in the configuration space. It is shown that the eigenfunctions can be easily computed in the momentum space by a Fourier transform using the properties of the basis functions. Observables in this space can also be easily obtained.,0
"A public release of slitless spectra, obtained with ACS/WFC and the G800L grism, is presented. Spectra were automatically extracted in a uniform way from 153 archival fields (or """"associations"""") distributed across the two Galactic caps, covering all observations to 2008. The ACS G800L grism provides a wavelength range of 0.55-1.00 \mu$m, with a dispersion of $40 \ \AA / pixel$ and a resolution of $\sim 80\ \AA$ for point-like sources. The ACS G800L images and matched direct images were reduced with an automatic pipeline that handles all steps from archive retrieval, alignment and astrometric calibration, direct image combination, catalogue generation, spectral extraction and collection of metadata. The large number of extracted spectra (73,581) demanded automatic methods for quality control and an automated classification algorithm was trained on the visual inspection of several thousand spectra. The final sample of quality controlled spectra includes 47,919 datasets (65% of the total number of extracted spectra) for $32,149$ unique objects, with a median $i_{\rm AB}$-band magnitude of 23.7, reaching 26.5 AB for the faintest objects. Each released dataset contains science-ready 1D and 2D spectra, as well as multi-band image cutouts of corresponding sources and a useful preview page summarising the direct and slitless data, astrometric and photometric parameters. In order to characterize the slitless spectra, emission-line flux and equivalent width sensitivity of the ACS data were compared with public ground-based spectra in the GOODS-South field. An example list of emission line galaxies with two or more identified lines is also included, covering the redshift range $0.2-4.6$.",0
"We explore frame-level audio feature learning for chord recognition using artificial neural networks. We present the argument that chroma vectors potentially hold enough information to model harmonic content of audio for chord recognition, but that standard chroma extractors compute too noisy features. This leads us to propose a learned chroma feature extractor based on artificial neural networks. It is trained to compute chroma features that encode harmonic information important for chord recognition, while being robust to irrelevant interferences. We achieve this by feeding the network an audio spectrum with context instead of a single frame as input. This way, the network can learn to selectively compensate noise and resolve harmonic ambiguities. We compare the resulting features to hand-crafted ones by using a simple linear frame-wise classifier for chord recognition on various data sets. The results show that the learned feature extractor produces superior chroma vectors for chord recognition.",0
"We study the general requirement for supersymmetric AdS$_6$ solutions in type IIB supergravity. We employ the Killing spinor technique and study the differential and algebraic relations among various Killing spinor bilinears to find the canonical form of the solutions. Our result agrees precisely with the work of Apruzzi et. al. \cite{Apruzzi:2014qva} which used the pure spinor technique. We also obtained the four-dimensional theory through the dimensional reduction of type IIB supergravity on AdS$_6$. This effective action is essentially a nonlinear sigma model with five scalar fields parametrizing $\textrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{R})/\textrm{SO}(2,1)$, modified by a scalar potential and coupled to Einstein gravity in Euclidean signature. We argue that the scalar potential can be explained by a subgroup CSO(1,1,1) $\subset\textrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{R})$ in a way analogous to gauged supergravity.",0
"A relation between entanglement and criticality of spin chains is established. The entanglement we exploit is shared between auxiliary particles, which are isolated from each other, but are coupled to the same critical spin-1/2 chain. We analytically evaluate the reduced density matrix, and numerically show the entanglement of the auxiliary particles in the proximity of the critical points of the spin chain. We find that the entanglement induced by the spin-chain may reach one, and it can signal very well the critical points of the chain. A physical understanding and experimental realization with trapped ions are presented.",0
We discuss the $\zeta-$regularized determinant of elliptic boundary value problems on a line segment. Our framework is applicable for separated and non-separated boundary conditions.,0
"In the context of Type IIB compactified on a large volume Swiss-Cheese orientifold in the presence of a mobile space-time filling D3-brane and stacks of fluxed D7-branes wrapping the """"big"""" divisor Sigma_B of a Swiss-Cheese Calabi Yau in WCP^4 [1,1,1,6,9], we explore various implications of moduli dynamics and discuss their couplings and decay into MSSM (-like) matter fields early in the history of universe to reach thermal equilibrium. Like finite temperature effects in O'KKLT, we observe that the local minimum of zero-temperature effective scalar potential is stable against any finite temperature corrections (up to two-loops) in large volume scenarios as well. Also, we find that moduli are heavy enough to avoid any cosmological moduli problem.",0
"In Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) the eigenmodes of the Dirac operator with small absolute eigenvalues have a close relationship to the dynamical breaking of the chiral symmetry. In a simulation with two dynamical quarks, we study the behavior of meson propagators when removing increasingly more of those modes in the valence sector, thus partially removing effects of chiral symmetry breaking. We find that some of the symmetry aspects are restored (e.g., the masses of $\rho$ and $a_1$ approach each other) while confining properties persist.",0
"Let $(X, A)$ be a nonsingular polarized toric 3-fold. We show that if the adjoint bundle of $A$ has no glabal section, then all ample line bundles on $X$ are normally generated. Even if the adjoint bundle is effective, if it is not big, then it is shown the normal generation. In particular, we show that all ample line bundles on a nonsingular toric Fano 3-fold are normally generated.",0
In this note we shall generalize the Stone duality between compact totally disconnected spaces and Boolean algebras to a duality between all complete non-Archimedean uniform spaces and Boolean algebras.,0
"""""Brane Supersymmetry Breaking"""" is a peculiar string-scale mechanism that can unpair Bose and Fermi excitations in orientifold models. It results from the simultaneous presence, in the vacuum, of collections of D-branes and orientifolds that are not mutually BPS, and is closely tied to the scale of string excitations. It also leaves behind, for a mixing of dilaton and internal breathing mode, an exponential potential that is just too steep for a scalar to emerge from the initial singularity while descending it. As a result, in this class of models the scalar can generically bounce off the exponential wall, and this dynamics brings along, in the power spectrum, an infrared depression typically followed by a pre-inflationary peak. We elaborate on a possible link between this type of bounce and the low-$\ell$ end of the CMB angular power spectrum. For the first 32 multipoles, one can reach a 50 % reduction in $\chi^{\,2}$ with respect to the standard $\Lambda$CDM setting.",0
"Precise characterization of the mutual information of MIMO systems is required to assess the throughput of wireless communication channels in the presence of Rician fading and spatial correlation. Here, we present an asymptotic approach allowing to approximate the distribution of the mutual information as a Gaussian distribution in order to provide both the average achievable rate and the outage probability. More precisely, the mean and variance of the mutual information of the separatelycorrelated Rician fading MIMO channel are derived when the number of transmit and receive antennas grows asymptotically large and their ratio approaches a finite constant. The derivation is based on the replica method, an asymptotic technique widely used in theoretical physics and, more recently, in the performance analysis of communication (CDMA and MIMO) systems. The replica method allows to analyze very difficult system cases in a comparatively simple way though some authors pointed out that its assumptions are not always rigorous. Being aware of this, we underline the key assumptions made in this setting, quite similar to the assumptions made in the technical literature using the replica method in their asymptotic analyses. As far as concerns the convergence of the mutual information to the Gaussian distribution, it is shown that it holds under some mild technical conditions, which are tantamount to assuming that the spatial correlation structure has no asymptotically dominant eigenmodes. The accuracy of the asymptotic approach is assessed by providing a sizeable number of numerical results. It is shown that the approximation is very accurate in a wide variety of system settings even when the number of transmit and receive antennas is as small as a few units.",0
We show that atoms or molecules subject to fields that couple their internal and translational (momentum) states may undergo a crossover from randomization (diffusion) to strong localization (sharpening) of their momentum distribution. The predicted crossover should be manifest by a drastic change of the interference pattern as a function of the coupling fields.,0
"We propose an evolution equation for unintegrated gluon densities that is valid for large values of the QCD coupling constant $\bar{\alpha} _s$. Our approach is based on the linear resummation model introduced by Sta\'{s}to. We generalize the model including a non-linear term in the diffusive regime. The validity of the diffusive evolution at strong coupling is supported by the AdS/CFT consideration, as well as perturbative arguments. We solve the evolution equation numerically and extract the saturation scale, which we compare with the weak coupling counterpart.",0
We present quantum Maxwell-Bloch equations (QMBE) for spatially inhomogeneous optical semiconductor devices taking into account the quantum noise effects which cause spontaneous emission and amplified spontaneous emission. Analytical expressions derived from the QMBE are presented for the spontaneous emission factor beta and the far field pattern of amplified spontaneous emission in broad area quantum well lasers.,0
"A topological geon black hole with gauge charges may have a gauge bundle that necessarily incorporates charge conjugation as a gauge symmetry. This happens for example for the Reissner-Nordstrom geon. We show that gauging the charge conjugation leaves an imprint in the Unruh effect: the geon's exterior region contains non-thermal correlations for particle pairs of the same, rather than opposite, charge. The phenomenon occurs also in topologically similar Rindler spacetimes with a background gauge field.",0
"A classical theorem of Hutchinson asserts that if an iterated function system acts on $\mathbb{R}^d$ by similitudes and satisfies the open set condition then it admits a unique self-similar measure with Hausdorff dimension equal to the dimension of the attractor. In the class of measures on the attractor which arise as the projections of shift-invariant measures on the coding space, this self-similar measure is the unique measure of maximal dimension. In the context of affine iterated function systems it is known that there may be multiple shift-invariant measures of maximal dimension if the linear parts of the affinities share a common invariant subspace, or more generally if they preserve a finite union of proper subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^d$. In this note we construct examples where multiple invariant measures of maximal dimension exist even though the linear parts of the affinities do not preserve a finite union of proper subspaces.",0
"In this paper we study progressive filtration expansions with random times. We show how semimartingale decompositions in the expanded filtration can be obtained using a natural link between progressive and initial expansions. The link is, on an intuitive level, that the two coincide after the random time. We make this idea precise and use it to establish known and new results in the case of expansion with a single random time. The methods are then extended to the multiple time case, without any restrictions on the ordering of the individual times. Finally we study the link between the expanded filtrations from the point of view of filtration shrinkage. As the main analysis progresses, we indicate how the techniques can be generalized to other types of expansions.",0
"Qualitative and quantitative aspects for variational inequalities governed by merely continuous and strongly pseudomonotone operators are investigated in this paper. First, we establish a global error bound for the solution set of the given problem with the residual function being the normal map. Second, we will prove that the iterative sequences generated by gradient projection method (GPM) with stepsizes forming a non-summable diminishing sequence of positive real numbers converge to the unique solution of the problem with bounded constraint set. Two counter-examples are given to show the necessity of the boundedness assumption and the variation of stepsizes. A modification of GPM is proposed for unbounded case. Finally, we analyze the convergence rate of the iterative sequences generated by this method.",0
We study the number of distinct ways in which a smooth projective surface $X$ can be realized as a smooth toroidal compactification of a ball quotient. It follows from work of Hirzebruch that there are infinitely many distinct ball quotients with birational smooth toroidal compactifications. We take this to its natural extreme by constructing arbitrarily large families of distinct ball quotients with biholomorphic smooth toroidal compactifications.,0
"We show that the observed pattern of quark flavor mixing, such as |V_{us}| \simeq |V_{cd}|, |V_{cb}| \simeq |V_{ts}|, |V_{cd}/V_{td}| \simeq |V_{cs}/V_{ts}| \simeq |V_{tb}/V_{cb}| and |V_{ub}/V_{cb}| < |V_{td}/V_{ts}|, can essentially be understood in the chiral and heavy quark mass limits. In particular, the phenomenologically successful relations |V_{ub}/V_{cb}| \sim \sqrt{m_u/m_c} and |V_{td}/V_{ts}| \simeq \sqrt{m_d/m_s} can be reasonably conjectured in the m_b \to \infty and m_t \to \infty limits, respectively. We stress that the strength of weak CP violation in the quark sector is determined by the moduli of the four corner elements of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix. A comparison between strong and weak CP-violating effects in the standard model is also made.",0
"So far, none of the known and confirmed experiments have cast any doubts on foundations of special relativity (SR) (see, e.g., experiments on superluminal quantum tunneling [1-3]). The same is true regarding the impact of quantum non-locality; as we know it today, in no way does it challenge SR [4, 5]. In this brief comment we argue that even if the superluminal neutrinos do exist, this fact by itself will not overturn Relativity.",0
"We show that in a large class of models based on anomalous U(1) symmetry which addresses the fermion mass hierarchy problem, leptonic flavor changing processes are induced that are in the experimentally interesting range. The flavor violation occurs through the renormalization group evolution of the soft SUSY breaking parameters between the string scale and the U(1)_A breaking scale. We derive general expressions for the evolution of these parameters in the presence of higher dimensional operators. Several sources for the flavor violation are identified: flavor-dependent contributions to the soft masses from the U(1)_A gaugino, scalar mass corrections proportional to the trace of U(1)_A charge, non-proportional A-terms from vertex corrections, and the U(1)_A D-term. Quantitative estimates for the decays \mu -> e \gamma and \tau -> \mu \gamma are presented in supergravity models which accommodate the relic abundance of neutralino dark matter.",0
"We prove that a """"random"""" free group outer automorphism is an ageometric fully irreducible outer automorphism whose ideal Whitehead graph is a union of triangles. In particular, we show that its attracting (and repelling) tree is a nongeometric $\mathbb R$-tree all of whose branch points are trivalent",0
"The goal of system identification is to learn about underlying physics dynamics behind the time-series data. To model the probabilistic and nonparametric dynamics model, Gaussian process (GP) have been widely used; GP can estimate the uncertainty of prediction and avoid over-fitting. Traditional GPSSMs, however, are based on Gaussian transition model, thus often have difficulty in describing a more complex transition model, e.g. aircraft motions. To resolve the challenge, this paper proposes a framework using multiple GP transition models which is capable of describing multi-modal dynamics. Furthermore, we extend the model to the information-theoretic framework, the so-called InfoSSM, by introducing a mutual information regularizer helping the model to learn interpretable and distinguishable multiple dynamics models. Two illustrative numerical experiments in simple Dubins vehicle and high-fidelity flight simulator are presented to demonstrate the performance and interpretability of the proposed model. Finally, this paper introduces a framework using InfoSSM with Bayesian filtering for air traffic control tracking.",0
"In the present paper, by using estimates for the generalized Ricci curvature, we shall give some gap theorems for Ricci-harmonic solitons showing some necessary and sufficient conditions for the solitons to be harmonic-Einstein. Our results may be regarded as a generalization of recent works by H. Li, and M. Fernandez-Lopez and E. Garcia-Rio.",0
"The tree-level amplitude for the scattering of two gauge particles constrained to move on the two distinct boundaries of eleven-dimensional space-time in the Horava-Witten formulation of M-theory is constructed. At low momenta this reproduces the corresponding tree-level scattering amplitude of the E_8xE_8 heterotic string theory. After compactification to nine dimensions on a large circle with a suitable Wilson line to break the symmetry to SO(16)xSO(16) this amplitude is used to describe the scattering of two massive SO(16) spinor states - one from each factor of the unbroken symmetry group. The amplitude contains a component that is associated with the exchange of a Kaluza-Klein charge between the boundaries, which is interpreted as the exchange of a D-particle between orientifold planes in the Type IA theory. This is related by T-duality to the effect of a non-BPS D-instanton in the Type I theory which is only invariant under those elements of O(16)xSO(16) that are in SO(16)xSO(16).",0
"We present the baseline multimessenger analysis method for the joint observations of gravitational waves (GW) and high-energy neutrinos (HEN), together with a detailed analysis of the expected science reach of the joint search. The analysis method combines data from GW and HEN detectors, and uses the blue-luminosity-weighted distribution of galaxies. We derive expected GW+HEN source rate upper limits for a wide range of source parameters covering several emission models. Using published sensitivities of externally triggered searches, we derive joint upper limit estimates both for the ongoing analysis with the initial LIGO-Virgo GW detectors with the partial IceCube detector (22 strings) HEN detector and for projected results to advanced LIGO-Virgo detectors with the completed IceCube (86 strings). We discuss the constraints these upper limits impose on some existing GW+HEN emission models.",0
We define an invariant for compact spin manifolds $X$ of dimension $4k$ equipped with a metric $h$ of positive Yamabe invariant on its boundary. The vanishing of this invariant is a necessary condition for the conformal class of $h$ to be the conformal infinity of a conformally compact Einstein metric on $X$.,0
"It is shown how in principle for non-abelian gauge theories it is possible in the finite volume hamiltonian framework to make sense of calculating the expectation value of ||A||^2=\int d^3x(A^a_i(x))^2. Gauge invariance requires one to replace ||A||^2 by its minimum over the gauge orbit, which makes it a highly non-local quantity. We comment on the difficulty of finding a gauge invariant expression for ||A||^2_{min} analogous to that found for the abelian case, and the relation of this question to Gribov copies. We deal with these issues by implementing the hamiltonian on the so-called fundamental domain, with appropriate boundary conditions in field space, essential to correctly represent the physics of the problem.",0
"We perform a first-principles study of Mg adatom and adislands on the Mg(0001) surface, and Be adatom on Be(0001), to obtain further insights into the previously reported energetic preference of the fcc faulty stacking of Mg monomers on Mg(0001). We first provide a viewpoint on how Friedel oscillations influence ionic relaxation on these surfaces. Our three-dimensional charge-density analysis demonstrates that Friedel oscillations have maxima which are more spatially localized than what one-dimensional average density or two-dimensional cross sectional plots could possibly inform: The well-known charge-density enhancement around the topmost surface layer of Mg(0001) is strongly localized at its fcc hollow sites. The charge accumulation at this site explains the energetically preferred stacking fault of the Mg monomer, dimer and trimer. Yet, larger islands prefer the normal hcp stacking. Surprisingly, the mechanism by which the fcc site becomes energetically more favorable is not that of enhancing the surface-adatom bonds but rather those between surface atoms. To confirm our conclusions, we analyze the stacking of Be adatom on Be(0001) - a surface also largely influenced by Friedel oscillations. We find, in fact, a much stronger effect: The charge enhancement at the fcc site is even larger and, consequently, the stacking-fault energy favoring the fcc site is quite large, 44 meV.",0
"Analytical models of chemical evolution, including inflow and outflow of gas, are important tools to study how the metal content in galaxies evolves as a function of time. In this work, we present new analytical solutions for the evolution of the gas mass, total mass and metallicity of a galactic system, when a decaying exponential infall rate of gas and galactic winds are assumed. We apply our model to characterize a sample of local star-forming and passive galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data, with the aim of reproducing their observed mass-metallicity relation; in this way, we can derive how the two populations of star-forming and passive galaxies differ in their particular distribution of ages, formation time scales, infall masses and mass loading factors. We find that the local passive galaxies are on average older and assembled on shorter typical time-scales than the local star-forming ones; on the other hand, the larger mass star-forming galaxies show generally older ages and longer typical formation time-scales compared with the smaller mass star-forming galaxies. Finally, we conclude that the local star-forming galaxies experience stronger galactic winds than the passive galaxy population. We explore the effect of assuming different initial mass functions in our model, showing that to reproduce the observed mass-metallicity relation stronger winds are requested if the initial mass function is top-heavy. Finally, our analytical models predict the assumed sample of local galaxies to lie on a tight surface in the 3D space defined by stellar metallicity, star formation rate and stellar mass, thus mimicking the well-known """"fundamental relation"""".",0
"Motivated by some recent developments in $\Psi$-fractional calculus, in this paper some new properties and the uniqueness of $ \Psi $-Laplace transform in the settings of $ \Psi $-fractional calculus are established.

"We find that the nonperturbative physics of the standard-model Higgs Lagrangian provides a dark matter candidate, """"dormant skyrmion in the standard model"""", the same type of the skyrmion, a soliton, as in the hadron physics.

"In this paper a generalization of the Cahn-Hilliard theory of binary liquids is presented for multi-component incompressible liquid mixtures. First, a thermodynamically consistent convection-diffusion type dynamics is derived on the basis of the Lagrange multiplier formalism. Next, a generalization of the binary Cahn-Hilliard free energy functional is presented for arbitrary number of components, offering the utilization of independent pairwise equilibrium interfacial properties. We show that the equilibrium two-component interfaces minimize the functional, and demonstrate, that the energy penalization for multi-component states increases strictly monotonously as a function of the number of components being present. We validate the model via equilibrium contact angle calculations in ternary and quaternary (4-component) systems. Simulations addressing liquid flow assisted spinodal decomposition in these systems are also presented.",0
"Interaction between the lattice and the orbital degrees of freedom not only makes rare-earth nickelates unusually """"bad metal"""", but also introduces a temperature driven insulator-metal phase transition. Here we investigate this insulator-metal phase transition in thin films of $\mathrm{SmNiO_3}$ using the slow time dependent fluctuations (noise) in resistivity. The normalized magnitude of noise is found to be extremely large, being nearly eight orders of magnitude higher than thin films of common disordered metallic systems, and indicates electrical conduction via classical percolation in a spatially inhomogeneous medium. The higher order statistics of the fluctuations indicate a strong non-Gaussian component of noise close to the transition, attributing the inhomogeneity to co-existence of the metallic and insulating phases. Our experiment offers a new insight on the impact of lattice-orbital coupling on the microscopic mechanism of electron transport in the rare-earth nickelates.",0
Inferring the presence of critical dynamics from continuous measure- ments is a challenging problem. We solve this problem by showing that continuous narrowband dynamics from a critical system exhibit qualita- tively differing behaviors which depend on the universality class; we term each region of critical avalanche parameters which generates qualitatively constant behavior a meta-universality class. This theoretical observation allows us to infer membership of a given meta-universality class and thus yields a robust test for criticality. We validate these theoretical predic- tions in simulations and provide unequivocal evidence for criticality in the human brain on the basis electrophysiological recordings.,0
"We study the Fermi-Hubbard model in the strongly correlated Mott phase under the influence of a harmonically oscillating electric field, e.g., a pump laser. In the Peierls representation, this pump field can be represented as an oscillating phase of the hopping rate $J(t)$, such that the effective time-averaged rate $\bar J$ is reduced, i.e., switching the pump laser suddenly is analogous to a quantum quench. Apart from this time-averaged rate $\bar J$, it is well known that the oscillating component of $J(t)$ can resonantly create particle-hole pairs if the pump frequency $\omega_{\rm pump}$ equals (or a little exceeds) the Mott gap. In addition, we find that it is possible to create multiple pairs if $\omega_{\rm pump}$ is near an integer multiple of the gap. These findings should be relevant for pump-probe experiments.",0
"We have combined optical and near-infrared data of known RR Lyrae (RRL) stars in the bulge in order to study the spatial distribution of its metal-poor component by measuring precise reddening values and distances of 7663 fundamental-mode RRL stars with high-quality photometry. We obtain a distance to the Galactic center of R0 = 8.33 +/- 0.05 +/- 0.14 kpc. We find that the spatial distribution of the RRL stars differs from the structures traced by the predominantly metal-rich red clump (RC) stars. Unlike the RC stars, the RRL stars do not trace a strong bar, but have a more spheroidal, centrally concentrated distribution, showing only a slight elongation in its very center. We find a hint of bimodality in the density distribution at high southern latitudes (b < -5), which needs to be confirmed by extending the areal coverage of the current census. The different spatial distributions of the metal-rich and metal-poor stellar populations suggest that the Milky Way has a composite bulge.",0
"We establish some results in local harmonic analysis which are necessary for Arthur's invariant trace formula for coverings of connected reductive groups. More precisely, for local coverings we will study (1) the Plancherel formula and its preparations, (2) the normalization of intertwining operators subject to Arthur's conditions, (3) the local behavior of characters of admissible representations in the nonarchimedean case, and (4) the genuine part of the invariant local trace formula. As a byproduct of the invariant local trace formula, we deduce the density of tempered characters for coverings.",0
"We show that the ground state of the well-known pseudo-stationary states for the Caldirola-Kanai Hamiltonian is a generalized minimum uncertainty state, which has the minimum allowed uncertainty $\Delta q \Delta p = \hbar \sigma_0/2$, where $\sigma_0 (\geq 1)$ is a constant depending on the damping factor and natural frequency. The most general symmetric Gaussian states are obtained as the one-parameter squeezed states of the pseudo-stationary ground state. It is further shown that the coherent states of the pseudo-stationary ground state constitute another class of the generalized minimum uncertainty states.",0
"The temperature dependence of the volume and surface components of the nuclear symmetry energy (NSE) and their ratio is investigated in the framework of the local density approximation (LDA). The results of these quantities for finite nuclei are obtained within the coherent density fluctuation model (CDFM). The CDFM weight function is obtained using the temperature-dependent proton and neutron densities calculated through the HFBTHO code that solves the nuclear Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov problem by using the cylindrical transformed deformed harmonic-oscillator basis. We present and discuss the values of the volume and surface contributions to the NSE and their ratio obtained for the Ni, Sn, and Pb isotopic chains around double-magic $^{78}$Ni, $^{132}$Sn, and $^{208}$Pb nuclei. The results for the $T$-dependence of the considered quantities are compared with estimations made previously for zero temperature showing the behavior of the NSE components and their ratio, as well as with the available experimental data. The sensitivity of the results on various forms of the density dependence of the symmetry energy is studied. We confirm the existence of `kinks' of these quantities as functions of the mass number at $T=0$ MeV for the double closed-shell nuclei $^{78}$Ni and $^{132}$Sn and the lack of `kinks' for the Pb isotopes, as well as the disappearance of these kinks as the temperature increases.",0
"We prove a sufficient condition for the Jacobian problem in the setting of real, complex and mixed polynomial mappings. This follows from the study of the bifurcation locus of a mapping subject to a new Newton non-degeneracy condition.",0
"Cognitive Radio Networks allow unlicensed users to opportunistically access the licensed spectrum without causing disruptive interference to the primary users (PUs). One of the main challenges in CRNs is the ability to detect PU transmissions. Recent works have suggested the use of secondary user (SU) cooperation over individual sensing to improve sensing accuracy. In this paper, we consider a CRN consisting of a single PU and multiple SUs to study the problem of maximizing the total expected system throughput. We propose a Bayesian decision rule based algorithm to solve the problem optimally with a constant time complexity. To prioritize PU transmissions, we re-formulate the throughput maximization problem by adding a constraint on the PU throughput. The constrained optimization problem is shown to be NP-hard and solved via a greedy algorithm with pseudo-polynomial time complexity that achieves strictly greater than 1/2 of the optimal solution. We also investigate the case for which a constraint is put on the sensing time overhead, which limits the number of SUs that can participate in cooperative sensing. We reveal that the system throughput is monotonic over the number of SUs chosen for sensing. We illustrate the efficacy of the performance of our algorithms via a numerical investigation.",0
"We consider the supersymmetry (SUSY) transformations in the chiral Lagrangian for $N = 1$ supergravity (SUGRA) with the complex tetrad following the method used in the usual $N = 1$ SUGRA, and present the explicit form of the SUSY trasformations in the first-order form. The SUSY transformations are generated by two independent Majorana spinor parameters, which are apparently different from the constrained parameters employed in the method of the 2-form gravity. We also calculate the commutator algebra of the SUSY transformations on-shell.",0
"We report on active region EUV dynamic events observed simultaneously at high-cadence with SUMER/SoHO and TRACE. Although the features appear in the TRACE Fe ix/x 171A images as jets seen in projection on the solar disk, the SUMER spectral line profiles suggest that the plasma has been driven along a curved large scale magnetic structure, a pre-existing loop. The SUMER observations were carried out in spectral lines covering a large temperature range from 10^4 K to 10^6 K. The spectral analysis revealed that a sudden heating from an energy deposition is followed by a high velocity plasma flow. The Doppler velocities were found to be in the range from 90 to 160 km/s. The heating process has a duration which is below the SUMER exposure time of 25 s while the lifetime of the events is from 5 to 15 min. The additional check on soft X-ray Yohkoh images shows that the features most probably reach 3 MK (X-ray) temperatures. The spectroscopic analysis showed no existence of cold material during the events.",0
"The chapter combines analytical (statistical-thermodynamic and kinetic) with numerical (Kubo-Greenwood-formalism-based) approaches used to ascertain an influence of the configurations of point (impurities, vacancies) and line (grain boundaries, atomic steps) defects on the charge transport in graphene. Possible substitutional and interstitial graphene-based superstructures are predicted and described. The arrangements of dopants over sites or interstices related with interatomic-interaction energies governing the configurations of impurities. Depending on whether the interatomic interactions are short- or long-range, the low-temperature stability diagrams in terms of interaction-energy parameters are obtained. The dominance of intersublattice interactions in competition with intrasublattice ones results in a nonmonotony of ordering-process kinetics. Spatial correlations of impurities do not affect the electronic conductivity of graphene for the most important experimentally-relevant cases of point defects, neutral adatoms and screened charged impurities, while atomic ordering can give rise in the conductivity up to tens times for weak and strong short-range potentials. There is no ordering effect manifestation for long-range potentials. The anisotropy of the conductivity along and across the line defects is revealed and gives rise in the conductivity of graphene with correlated line defects as compared with the case of random ones. Simultaneously correlated (and/or ordered) point and line defects in graphene can give rise in the conductivity up to hundreds times vs. their random distribution. On an example of different B or N doping configurations in graphene, results from the Kubo-Greenwood approach are compared with those obtained from DFT method.",0
"Extending the formulation for open superstring field theory given in arXiv:1508.00366, we attempt to construct a complete action for heterotic string field theory. The action is non-polynomial in the Ramond string field Psi, and we construct it order by order in Psi. Using a dual formulation in which the role of eta and Q is exchanged, the action is explicitly obtained at the quadratic and quartic order in Psi with the gauge transformations.",0
"Bright sources of high energy electromagnetic radiation are widely employed in fundamental research as well as in industry and medicine. This steadily growing interest motivated the construction of several facilities aiming at the realisation of sources of intense X- and gamma-ray pulses. To date, free electron lasers and synchrotrons provide intense sources of photons with energies up to 10-100 keV. Facilities under construction based on incoherent Compton back scattering of an optical laser pulse off an electron beam are expected to yield photon beams with energy up to 19.5 MeV and peak brilliance in the range 10$^{20}$-10$^{23}$ photons s$^{-1}$ mrad$^{-2}$ mm$^{-2}$ per 0.1% bandwidth. Here, we demonstrate a novel mechanism based on the strongly amplified synchrotron emission which occurs when a sufficiently dense electron beam interacts with a millimetre thickness solid target. For electron beam densities exceeding approximately $3\times10^{19}\text{ cm$^{-3}$}$ filamentation instability occurs with the self-generation of 10$^{7}$-10$^{8}$ gauss magnetic fields where the electrons of the beam are trapped. This results into a giant amplification of synchrotron emission with the production of collimated gamma-ray pulses with peak brilliance above $10^{25}$ photons s$^{-1}$ mrad$^{-2}$ mm$^{-2}$ per 0.1% bandwidth and photon energies ranging from 200 keV up to several hundreds MeV. These findings pave the way to compact, high-repetition-rate (kHz) sources of short (30 fs), collimated (mrad) and high flux ($>10^{12}$ photons/s) gamma-ray pulses.",0
"A2163 was observed by the RXTE satellite for 530 ks during a 6 month period starting in August 2004. The cluster primary emission is from very hot intracluster gas with kT~15 keV, but this component does not by itself provide the best fitting model. A secondary emission component is quite clearly needed, and while this could also be thermal at a temperature significantly lower than kT~15 keV, the best fit (to the combined PCA and HEXTE datasets) is obtained with a power law secondary spectral component. The deduced parameters of the non-thermal (NT) emission imply a significant fractional flux amounting to ~25% of the integrated 3-50 keV emission. NT emission is expected given the intense level of radio emission, most prominently from a large extended (`halo') central region of the cluster. Interpreting the deduced NT emission as Compton scattering of the radio-emitting relativistic electrons by the CMB, we estimate the volume-averaged value of the magnetic field in the extended radio region to be B=0.4+/-0.2 microG.",0
"The differential cross section of exclusive diffractive vector meson production in electron proton collisions carries important information on the geometric structure of the proton. More specifically, the coherent cross section as a function of the transferred transverse momentum is sensitive to the size of the proton, while the incoherent, or proton dissociative cross section is sensitive to fluctuations of the gluon distribution in coordinate space. We show that at high energies the experimentally measured coherent and incoherent cross sections for the production of $J/\Psi$ mesons are very well reproduced within the color glass condensate framework when strong geometric fluctuations of the gluon distribution in the proton are included. For $\rho$ meson production we also find reasonable agreement. We study in detail the dependence of our results on various model parameters, including the average proton shape, analyze the effect of saturation scale and color charge fluctuations and constrain the degree of geometric fluctuations.",0
"We show that the lightcone worldsheet formalism, constructed to represent the sum of the bare planar diagrams of scalar \phi^3 field theory, survives the renormalization procedure in space-time dimensions D not greater than 6. Specifically this means that all the counter-terms, necessary to produce a successful renormalized perturbation expansion to all orders, can be represented as local terms in the lightcone worldsheet action. Because the worldsheet regulator breaks Lorentz invariance, we find the need for two non-covariant counter-terms, in addition to the usual mass, coupling and wave function renormalization. One of these can be simply interpreted as a rescaling of transverse coordinates with respect to longitudinal coordinates. The second one introduces couplings between the matter and ghost worldsheet fields on the boundaries.",0
"This paper is devoted to study a model of individual clustering with two specific reproduction rates in two space dimensions. Given q > 2 and an initial condition in W 1,q (\Omega), the local existence and uniqueness of solution have been shown in [6]. In this paper we give a detailed proof of existence of global solution.",0
"The Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect (SZ effect) is a complete probe of ionized baryons, the majority of which are likely hiding in the intergalactic medium. We ran a $512^3$ $\Lambda$CDM simulation using a moving mesh hydro code to compute the statistics of the thermal and kinetic SZ effect such as the power spectra and measures of non-Gaussianity. The thermal SZ power spectrum has a very broad peak at multipole $l\sim 2000-10^4$ with temperature fluctuations $\Delta T \sim 15\mu$K. The power spectrum is consistent with available observations and suggests a high $\sigma_8\simeq 1.0$ and a possible role of non-gravitational heating. The non-Gaussianity is significant and increases the cosmic variance of the power spectrum by a factor of $\sim 5$ for $l<6000$. We explore optimal driftscan survey strategies for the AMIBA CMB interferometer and their dependence on cosmology. For SZ power spectrum estimation, we find that the optimal sky coverage for a 1000 hours of integration time is several hundred square degrees. One achieves an accuracy better than 40% in the SZ measurement of power spectrum and an accuracy better than 20% in the cross correlation with Sloan galaxies for $2000<l<5000$. For cluster searches, the optimal scan rate is around 280 hours per square degree with a cluster detection rate 1 every 7 hours, allowing for a false positive rate of 20% and better than 30% accuracy in the cluster SZ distribution function measurement.",0
"Rederiving the one-loop divergences for the most general coupling of the open string sigma model by the heat kernel technique, we distinguish the classical background field from the mean field of the effective action. The latter is arbitrary, i.e. does not fulfil the boundary conditions. As a consequence a new divergent counter term strongly suggests the introduction of another external one-form field (beside the usual gauge field), coupled to the normal derivative at the boundary. Actually such a field has been proposed in the literature for different reasons, but its full impact never seems to have thoroughly investigated before. The beta function for the resulting renormalizable model is calculated and the consequences are discussed, including the ones for the Born-Infeld action. The most exciting property of the new coupling is that it enters the coefficient in front of the normal derivative in Neumann boundary conditions. For certain values of the background fields this coefficient vanishes, leading to Dirichlet boundary conditions. This provides a natural mechanism for the emergence of D-branes.",0
We study the index problem for the d-bar operators subject to Atiyah- Patodi-Singer boundary conditions on noncommutative disk and annulus.,0
"The paper discusses an assessment study about the impact of the distortions on the astrometric observations with the Extremely Large Telescope originated from the optics positioning errors and telescope instabilities. Optical simulations combined with Monte Carlo approach reproducing typical inferred opto-mechanical and dynamical instabilities, show RMS distortions between $\sim$ 0.1-5 mas over 1 arcmin field of view. Over minutes timescales the plate scale variations from ELT-M2 caused by wind disturbances and gravity flexures and the field rotation from ELT-M4-M5 induce distortions and PSF jitter at the edge of 1 arcmin FoV (radius 35 arcsec) up to $\sim$ 5 mas comparable to the diffraction-limited PSF size $FWHM_H = 8.5$ mas. The RMS distortions inherent to the ELT design are confined to the 1$^{st}$-3$^{rd}$ order and reduce to an astrometric RMS residual post fit of $\sim$ 10-20 $\mu as$ for higher order terms. In this paper, we study which calibration effort has to be undertaken to reach an astrometric stability close to this level of higher order residuals. The amplitude and timescales of the assumed telescope tolerances indicate the need for frequent on-sky calibrations and MCAO stabilization of the plate scale to enable astrometric observations with ELT at the level of $\leq 50 \mu as$, which is one of the core science missions for the ELT / MICADO instrument.",0
"Highly confined vectorial electromagnetic field distributions represent an excellent tool for detailed studies in nano-optics and high resolution microscopy, such as nonlinear microscopy, advanced fluorescence imaging or nanoplasmonics. Such field distributions can be generated, for instance, by tight focussing of polarized light beams. To guarantee high quality and resolution in the investigation of objects with sub-wavelength dimensions, the precise knowledge of the spatial distribution of the exciting vectorial field is of utmost importance. Full-field reconstruction methods presented so far involved, for instance, complex near-field techniques. Here, we demonstrate a simple and straight-forward to implement measurement scheme and reconstruction algorithm based on the scattering signal of a single spherical nanoparticle as a field-probe. We are able to reconstruct the amplitudes of the individual focal field components as well as their relative phase distributions with sub-wavelength resolution from a single scan measurement without the need for polarization analysis of the scattered light. This scheme can help to improve modern microscopy and nanoscopy techniques.",0
"High-resolution DC magnetization and AC-specific heat data of the cubic helimagnet FeGe have been measured as function of temperature and magnetic field. The magnetization data as well as the isothermal susceptibility data confirm the complexity of the magnetic phase diagram in the vicinity of the onset of long-rang magnetic order (Tc = 278.5 K) and the existence of a segmented A-phase region. Moreover, these data revealed independent and clear indications of phase boundaries and crossovers within the A-phase region. Together with the anomalies in the specific-heat data around Tc and at small magnetic fields (H < 600 Oe) a complex magnetic phase diagram of FeGe is obtained.",0
"We present multiwavelength data of the blazar 3C 454.3 obtained during an extremely bright outburst from November 2010 through January 2011. These include flux density measurements with the Herschel Space Observatory at five submillimeter-wave and far-infrared bands, the Fermi Large Area Telescope at gamma-ray energies, Swift at X-ray, ultraviolet (UV), and optical frequencies, and the Submillimeter Array at 1.3 mm. From this dataset, we form a series of 52 spectral energy distributions (SEDs) spanning nearly two months that are unprecedented in time coverage and breadth of frequency. Discrete correlation anlaysis of the millimeter, far-infrared, and gamma-ray light curves show that the variations were essentially simultaneous, indicative of co-spatiality of the emission, at these wavebands. In contrast, differences in short-term fluctuations at various wavelengths imply the presence of inhomegeneities in physical conditions across the source. We locate the site of the outburst in the parsec-scale core, whose flux density as measured on 7 mm Very Long Baseline Array images increased by 70 percent during the first five weeks of the outburst. Based on these considerations and guided by the SEDs, we propose a model in which turbulent plasma crosses a conical standing shock in the parsec-scale region of the jet. Here, the high-energy emission in the model is produced by inverse Compton scattering of seed photons supplied by either nonthermal radiation from a Mach disk, thermal emission from hot dust, or (for X-rays) synchrotron radiation from plasma that crosses the standing shock. For the two dates on which we fitted the model SED to the data, the model corresponds very well to the observations at all bands except at X-ray energies, where the spectrum is flatter than observed.",0
"We predict a novel type of Josephson effect to occur in triplet superconductor - ferromagnet - triplet superconductor Josephson junctions. We show that the Josephson current, I_J, exhibits a rich dependence on the relative orientation between the ferromagnetic moment and the d-vectors of the superconductors. This dependence can be used to build several types of Josephson current switches. Moreover, we predict an unconventional temperature dependence of I_J in which I_J changes sign with increasing temperature",0
This paper presents a general method for combining uncertain and paradoxical source of evidences for a wide class of fusion problems. From the foundations of the Dezert-Smarandache Theory (DSmT) we show how the DSm rule of combination can be adapted to take into account all possible integrity constraints (if any) of the problem under consideration due to the true nature of elements/concepts involved into it. We show how the Shafer's model can be considered as a specific DSm hybrid model and be easily handled by our approach and a new efficient rule of combination different from the Dempster's rule is obtained. Several simple examples are also provided to show the efficiency and the generality of the approach proposed in this work.,0
Propagation of broadband photon pairs over deployed telecommunication fibers is used to achieve nonlocal dispersion compensation without the deliberate introduction of negative dispersion. This is made possible by exploiting time-energy entanglement and the positive and negative dispersive properties of the fiber. We demonstrate preservation of photon timing correlations after transmission over two multi-segment 10km spans of deployed fiber and up to 80km of laboratory-based fiber.,0
"For smooth metric measure spaces $(M, g, e^{-f} dvol)$ we prove a Liuoville-type theorem when the Bakry-Emery Ricci tensor is nonnegative. This generalizes a result of Yau, which is recovered in the case $f$ is constant. This result follows from a gradient estimate for f-harmonic functions on smooth metric measure spaces with Bakry-Emery Ricci tensor bounded from below.",0
"(Abridged) We present in this paper a sample of 14 nearby clusters of galaxies observed with the ROSAT/PSPC. We only select clusters with low galactic nH in order to trace the X-ray emitting intra-cluster medium (ICM) out to large radii. We convert the X-ray surface brightness profiles of the clusters into emission measure profiles scaled to the classical scaling relations based on the spherical collapse model. We sort the clusters into different temperature bins and stack the scaled emission measure (ScEM) profiles of clusters together. The stacked profiles allow us to observe out to radii r>r_200. In the center we find that the ScEM profiles deviate from predicted scaling laws. This result is in very good agreement with current studies on the L_X-T relation and the entropy - temperature relation (S \propto T^0.65) found recently. At radii r>0.4r_200 we find that the ScEM profiles agree well within the error bars, suggesting self-similarity. Fitting beta-models to the overall ScEM profiles we find for the different sub samples r_c=0.15-0.18 r_200 and beta=0.8, which is higher than beta=2/3 often found. The beta-model is generally a better representation for hotter than for cooler clusters. We see indications for continuous steepening of the profiles with increasing radius: at radii r>0.8r_200 the profiles are systematically below the beta-model curve with beta=0.8. We discuss our results with respect to the observed X-ray luminosity L_X-T relation, the gas mass M_gas-T relation and the total mass M-T relation. We also address implications on the origin of the observed S-T relation. Furthermore we discuss the observed steepness of the X-ray profiles, which falls off more rapidly than predicted from the NFW-profile for cold dark matter halos.",0
"It has been pointed out that the Newtonian second law can be tested in the very small acceleration regime by using the combined movement of the Earth and Sun around the Galactic center of mass. It has been shown that there are only two brief intervals during the year in which the experiment can be completed, which correspond to only two specific spots on the Earth surface. An alternative experimental setup is presented to allow the measurement to be made on Earth at any location and at any time.",0
"Trait variation and similarity among coexisting species can provide a window into the mechanisms that maintain their coexistence. Recent theoretical explorations suggest that competitive interactions will lead to groups, or clusters, of species with similar traits. However, theoretical predictions typically assume complete knowledge of the map between competition and measured traits. These assumptions limit the plausible application of these patterns for inferring competitive interactions in nature. Here we relax these restrictions and find that the clustering pattern is robust to contributions of unknown or unobserved niche axes. However, it may not be visible unless measured traits are close proxies for niche strategies. We conclude that patterns along single niche axes may reveal properties of interspecific competition in nature, but detecting these patterns requires natural history expertise firmly tying traits to niches.",0
"Performing highly accurate simulations of droplet systems is a challenging problem. This is primarily due to the interface dynamics which is complicated further by the addition of surfactants. This paper presents a boundary integral method for computing the evolution of surfactant-covered droplets in 2D Stokes flow. The method has spectral accuracy in space and the adaptive time-stepping scheme allows for control of the temporal errors. Previously available semi-analytical solutions (based on conformal-mapping techniques) are extended to include surfactants, and a set of algorithms is introduced to detail their evaluation. These semi-analytical solutions are used to validate and assess the accuracy of the boundary integral method, and it is demonstrated that the presented method maintains its high accuracy even when droplets are in close proximity.",0
"We study the Heisenberg-Kitaev chain in order to uncover the interplay between two qualitatively different integrable points in the physics of heat transport in one dimension. Focusing on high temperatures and using analytical as well as numerical approaches within linear response theory, we explore several directions in parameter space including exchange-coupling ratios, anisotropies, and external magnetic fields. We show the emergence of purely ballistic energy transport at all integrable points, manifest in pronounced Drude weights and low-frequency suppression of regular-conductivity contributions. Moreover, off integrability, we find extended quantum chaotic regions with vanishing Drude weights and well-defined DC conductivities. In the vicinity of the Kitaev point, we observe clear signatures of the topological gap in the response function. This gap coexists with a nonzero Drude weight in the Kitaev chain.",0
"If non-vanishing chemical potentials are assigned to chiral fermions, then a Chern-Simons term is induced for the corresponding gauge fields. In thermal equilibrium anomalous processes adjust the chemical potentials such that the coefficient of the Chern-Simons term vanishes, but it has been argued that there are non-equilibrium epochs in cosmology where this is not the case and that, consequently, certain fermionic number densities and large-scale (hypermagnetic) field strengths get coupled to each other. We generalise the Chern-Simons term to a real-time situation relevant for dynamical considerations, by deriving the anomalous Hard Thermal Loop effective action for the hypermagnetic fields, write down the corresponding equations of motion, and discuss some exponentially growing solutions thereof.",0
We present a model based on the gauge group SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R \times SU(4)_C with gauge couplings that are found to be unified at a scale near the string unification scale. This model breaks to the MSSM at an intermediate scale which is instrumental in producing a neutrino in a mass range that can serve as hot dark matter and can also solve the strong CP problem via a harmless invisible axion.,0
"This article discusses entanglement between two subsystems, one with discrete degrees of freedom and the other with continuous degrees of freedom. The overlap integral between continuous variable wave functions emerges as an important parameter to characterize this kind entanglement. ``Beam-like'' entanglement and ``shape-like'' entanglement are contrasted. One example of this kind of entanglement is between between the spin degrees of freedom and the momentum degrees of freedom for a non-relativistic particle. This intraparticle entanglement is Galilean invariant.",0
"Imperfect secrecy in communication systems is investigated. Instead of using equivocation as a measure of secrecy, the distortion that an eavesdropper incurs in producing an estimate of the source sequence is examined. The communication system consists of a source and a broadcast (wiretap) channel, and lossless reproduction of the source sequence at the legitimate receiver is required. A key aspect of this model is that the eavesdropper's actions are allowed to depend on the past behavior of the system. Achievability results are obtained by studying the performance of source and channel coding operations separately, and then linking them together digitally. Although the problem addressed here has been solved when the secrecy resource is shared secret key, it is found that substituting secret key for a wiretap channel brings new insights and challenges: the notion of weak secrecy provides just as much distortion at the eavesdropper as strong secrecy, and revealing public messages freely is detrimental.",0
"We use the natural $SU(3)\times U(1)$ global symmetry of the gauge-fermion interaction sector of the standard model to discuss the fermion mass hierarchy problem. The $SU(3)$ sixtet and triplet Higgs are introduced. The Yukawa sector is partially symmetric. The smaller the symmetry of a Yukawa term, the smaller its coupling constant. The mass hierarchy is a combined effect of smaller coupling constants and smaller VEVs. There is a bunch of pseudo-goldstone bosons which obtains their masses mainly from the small explicit breaking terms in the Higgs potential.",0
"An ultra-broadband transverse magnetic (TM) pass hyperuniform disordered photonic crystal (HUDPC) polarizer is proposed and demonstrated on a silicon-on-insulator platform. Propagation of the transverse electric mode is blocked by three combined effects, including the photonic bandgap (PBG) effect, diffusive (non-resonant) scattering, and bandedge resonances. Specially, the designed 30-dB bandwidth in polarization extinction ratio (PER) of 265 nm is much larger than the spectral width of the PBG (149 nm) due to using the bandedge resonances. The TM mode is in the subwavelength regime of the HUDPC and thus has a low insertion loss (IL). An ultrawide 30-dB bandwidth in PER of 210 nm (1.44-1.65 um) is experimentally demonstrated in a 12.9-um-long HUDPC polarizer with spectrally averaged PER of 39.6 dB and IL for the TM mode of 1.1 dB (IL = 0.6 dB at 1.55 um). The HUDPC polarizers can be an excellent candidate for ultra-broadband polarization filtering in the silicon photonic platform.",0
Ein and Lazarsfeld have shown that one can read off the gonality of an algebraic curve from its syzygies in the embedding defined by any one line bundle of sufficiently large degree. This note extends their approach and shows that the gonality can be detected from the syzygies of an embedding by any line bundle of degree at least 4g-3.,0
"Given the potential X-ray radiation risk to the patient, low-dose CT has attracted a considerable interest in the medical imaging field. The current main stream low-dose CT methods include vendor-specific sinogram domain filtration and iterative reconstruction, but they need to access original raw data whose formats are not transparent to most users. Due to the difficulty of modeling the statistical characteristics in the image domain, the existing methods for directly processing reconstructed images cannot eliminate image noise very well while keeping structural details. Inspired by the idea of deep learning, here we combine the autoencoder, the deconvolution network, and shortcut connections into the residual encoder-decoder convolutional neural network (RED-CNN) for low-dose CT imaging. After patch-based training, the proposed RED-CNN achieves a competitive performance relative to the-state-of-art methods in both simulated and clinical cases. Especially, our method has been favorably evaluated in terms of noise suppression, structural preservation and lesion detection.",0
Autoencoders enable data dimensionality reduction and a key component of many (deep) learning systems. This short paper introduces a form of Holland's Learning Classifier System (LCS) to perform autoencoding building upon a previously presented form of LCS that utilises unsupervised learning for clustering. Initial results using a neural network representation suggest it is an effective approach to reduction.,0
"We consider the system of a quantum well embedded in a planar semiconductor microcavity with a shallow circular mesa patterned on top of the cavity spacer. For this system we develop the linear coupling theory of polaritons. We then compute polariton eigenstates and the corresponding optical spectrum. The theory predicts the existence of laterally confined polariton states with a discrete energy spectrum, as well as continuum states above the finite mesa potential barrier.",0
"We present evidence of flux variability, on both short (hours) and long (months) time scales of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 7172. These results are based on the ASCA observation of NGC 7172 performed on May 1996. The source was detected at a rather low flux level, about 3 times fainter than its usual state (including one year before, when it was also observed by ASCA). The source also varied by about 30 percent during the observation, confirming the presence of a type 1 nucleus in its center. However, its spectrum appears to be flatter than the typical Seyfert 1 spectrum (in agreement with findings on other Seyfert 2's), posing problems for the unification model unless complex absorption is invoked.",0
"This mini-review synthesizes our understanding of the equilibrium behavior of particle models with short-range attractive and long-range repulsive (SALR) interactions. These models, which can form stable periodic microphases, aim to reproduce the essence of colloidal suspensions with competing interactions. Ordered structures, however, have yet to be obtained in experiments. In order to better understand the hurdles to periodic microphase assembly, marked theoretical and simulation advances have been made over the last few years. Here, we present recent progress in the study of microphases in models with SALR interactions using liquid-state theory and density-functional theory as well as numerical simulations. Combining these various approaches provides a description of periodic microphases, and give insights into the rich phenomenology of the surrounding disordered regime. Three additional ongoing research directions in the thermodynamics of models with SALR interactions are also presented.",0
"Introducing the fermionic R-operator and solutions of the inverse scattering problem for local fermion operators, we derive a multiple integral representation for zero-temperature correlation functions of a one-dimensional interacting spinless fermion model. Correlation functions particularly considered are the one-particle Green's function and the density-density correlation function both for any interaction strength and for arbitrary particle densities. In particular for the free fermion model, our formulae reproduce the known exact results. Form factors of local fermion operators are also calculated for a finite system.",0
"We report a wavelength-tunable Q-switched mode-locked fiber laser based on a compact optical tuning device, which is fabricated by coating single-layer graphene on the surface of micro-fiber Bragg grating (MFBG). Based on thermal-optical effect through evanescent interaction between graphene and MFBG, the center wavelength of MFBG can be accurately controlled by adjusting power of an external laser. By inserting the fabricated device into a compact fiber laser cavity mode-locked by single-wall carbon nanotubes, stable Q-switched mode-locked pulse is generated. Experimental results show that the wavelength can be precisely optical-tuned from 1550.1 nm to 1551.9 nm with a linear sensitivity of 6.3 pm/mW. Such an optical-controlled wavelength-tunable Q-switched mode-locked fiber laser may find potential applications in all-optical computing, all-optical logic gating and generation of microwave source.",0
We measured the electronic structure of Fe substituted Bi2212 using Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES). We find that the substitution does not change the momentum dependence of the superconducting gap but induces a very anisotropic enhancement of the scattering rate. A comparison of the effect of Fe substitution to that of Zn substitution suggests that the Fe reduces T$_c$ so effectively because it supresses very strongly the coherence weight around the anti-nodes.,0
"Entity resolution (ER) is the problem of identifying and merging records that refer to the same real-world entity. In many scenarios, raw records are stored under heterogeneous environment. Specifically, the schemas of records may differ from each other. To leverage such records better, most existing work assume that schema matching and data exchange have been done to convert records under different schemas to those under a predefined schema. However, we observe that schema matching would lose information in some cases, which could be useful or even crucial to ER. To leverage sufficient information from heterogeneous sources, in this paper, we address several challenges of ER on heterogeneous records and show that none of existing similarity metrics or their transformations could be applied to find similar records under heterogeneous settings. Motivated by this, we design the similarity function and propose a novel framework to iteratively find records which refer to the same entity. Regarding efficiency, we build an index to generate candidates and accelerate similarity computation. Evaluations on real-world datasets show the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods.",0
"This paper reviews the development of Chinese word segmentation (CWS) in the most recent decade, 2007-2017. Special attention was paid to the deep learning technologies that has already permeated into most areas of natural language processing (NLP). The basic view we have arrived at is that compared to traditional supervised learning methods, neural network based methods have not shown any superior performance. The most critical challenge still lies on balancing of recognition of in-vocabulary (IV) and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. However, as neural models have potentials to capture the essential linguistic structure of natural language, we are optimistic about significant progresses may arrive in the near future.",0
"We prove the theorem on the completeness of the root functions of the Schroedinger operator $L=-d^2/dx^2+p(x)$ on the semi-axis $\mathbb R_+$ with a complex--valued potential $p(x)$. It is assumed that the potential $p = q \pm ir$ is such that the real functions $q$ and $r$ are subject the conditions $$ q(x) \geqslant c r(x), \quad r(x) \geqslant c_0+ c_1 x^\alpha, \quad \alpha >0, $$ where the constants $c, \ c_0\in \mathbb R$, $c_1>0$ and $\arg(\pm i+c) < 2\alpha\pi/(2+\alpha)$. For the case of the Airy operator $L_c=-d^2/dx^2+cx$, $c=const$, this theorem imply the completeness of the system of the eigenfunctions of this operator if $|\arg c|<2\pi/3$. Using another technique based on the asymptotic behavior of the Airy functions we prove that the completeness theorem for the operator $L_c$ remains valid, provided that $|\arg c|<5\pi/6$.",0
"We develop an information-theoretic view of the stochastic block model, a popular statistical model for the large-scale structure of complex networks. A graph $G$ from such a model is generated by first assigning vertex labels at random from a finite alphabet, and then connecting vertices with edge probabilities depending on the labels of the endpoints. In the case of the symmetric two-group model, we establish an explicit `single-letter' characterization of the per-vertex mutual information between the vertex labels and the graph. The explicit expression of the mutual information is intimately related to estimation-theoretic quantities, and --in particular-- reveals a phase transition at the critical point for community detection. Below the critical point the per-vertex mutual information is asymptotically the same as if edges were independent. Correspondingly, no algorithm can estimate the partition better than random guessing. Conversely, above the threshold, the per-vertex mutual information is strictly smaller than the independent-edges upper bound. In this regime there exists a procedure that estimates the vertex labels better than random guessing.",0
"Streams are infinite sequences over a given data type. A stream specification is a set of equations intended to define a stream. We propose a transformation from such a stream specification to a term rewriting system (TRS) in such a way that termination of the resulting TRS implies that the stream specification is well-defined, that is, admits a unique solution. As a consequence, proving well-definedness of several interesting stream specifications can be done fully automatically using present powerful tools for proving TRS termination. In order to increase the power of this approach, we investigate transformations that preserve semantics and well-definedness. We give examples for which the above mentioned technique applies for the ransformed specification while it fails for the original one.",0
"We confront the finite volume and small quark mass behaviour of the scalar condensate, determined numerically in quenched lattice QCD using Neuberger fermions, with predictions of quenched chiral perturbation theory. We find that quenched chiral perturbation theory describes the numerical data well, allowing us to extract the infinite volume, chiral limit scalar condensate, up to a multiplicative renormalization constant.",0
"Biometric authentication techniques are more consistent and efficient than conventional authentication techniques and can be used in monitoring, transaction authentication, information retrieval, access control, forensics, etc. In this paper, we have presented a detailed comparative analysis between Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) which are used for feature extraction on the basis of different Artificial Neural Network (ANN) such as Back Propagation (BP), Radial Basis Function (RBF) and Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ). In this paper, we have chosen """"TULIPS1 database, (Movellan, 1995)"""" which is a small audiovisual database of 12 subjects saying the first 4 digits in English for the incorporation of above methods. The six geometric lip features i.e. height of the outer corners of the mouth, width of the outer corners of the mouth, height of the inner corners of the mouth, width of the inner corners of the mouth, height of the upper lip, and height of the lower lip which extracts the identity relevant information are considered for the research work. After the comprehensive analysis and evaluation a maximum of 91.07% accuracy in speaker recognition is achieved using PCA and RBF and 87.36% accuracy is achieved using ICA and RBF. Speaker identification has a wide scope of applications such as access control, monitoring, transaction authentication, information retrieval, forensics, etc.",0
"We present a model for a system involving a photon gauge field and a scalar field at quantum criticality in the frame of a Lifthitz-type non-relativistic Maxwell theory. We will show this model gives rise to Lorentz and CPT violation which leads to a frequency-dependent rotation of polarization plane of radiations, and so leaves potential signals on the cosmic microwave background temperature and polarization anisotropies.",0
"We present a numerical study of the magnetization process of frustrated quantum spin-S chains with S=1, 3/2, 2 as well as the classical limit. Using the exact diagonalization and density-matrix renormalization techniques, we provide evidence that a plateau at one third of the saturation magnetization exists in the magnetization curve of frustrated spin-S chains with S>1/2. Similar to the case of S=1/2, this plateau state breaks the translational symmetry of the Hamiltonian and realizes an up-up-down pattern in the spin component parallel to the external field. Our study further shows that this plateau exists both in the cases of an isotropic exchange and in the easy-axis regime for spin-S=1, 3/2, and 2, but is absent in classical frustrated spin chains with isotropic interactions. We discuss the magnetic phase diagram of frustrated spin-1 and spin-3/2 chains as well as other emergent features of the magnetization process such as kink singularities, jumps, and even-odd effects. A quantitative comparison of the one-third plateau in the easy-axis regime between spin-1 and spin-3/2 chains on the one hand and the classical frustrated chain on the other hand indicates that the critical frustration and the phase boundaries of this state rapidly approach the classical result as the spin S increases.",0
"We present a new method for generating initial conditions for LCDM N-body simulations which provides the dynamical range necessary to follow the evolution and distribution of the fossils of the first galaxies on Local Volume, 5-10 Mpc, scales. The initial distribution of particles represents the position, velocity and mass distribution of the dark and luminous halos extracted from pre-reionization simulations. We confirm previous results that ultra-faint dwarfs have properties compatible with being well preserved fossils of the first galaxies. However, because the brightest pre-reionization dwarfs form preferentially in biased regions, they most likely merge into non-fossil halos with circular velocities >20-30 km/s. Hence, we find that the maximum luminosity of true-fossils in the Milky Way is L_V<10^5 L_solar, casting doubts on the interpretation that some classical dSphs are true-fossils. In addition, we argue that most ultra-faints at small galactocentric distance, R<50 kpc, had their stellar properties modified by tides, while a large population of fossils is still undetected due to their extremely low surface brightness log(Sigma_V) < -1.4. We estimate that the region outside R_50 (~ 400 kpc) up to 1 Mpc from the Milky Way contains about a hundred true fossils of the first galaxies with V-band luminosities 10^3 - 10^5 L_solar and half-light radii, r_hl ~ 100-1000 pc.",0
"Models of epidemic spreading on complex networks have attracted great attention among researchers in physics, mathematics, and epidemiology due to their success in predicting and controlling scenarios of epidemic spreading in real-world scenarios. To understand the interplay between epidemic spreading and the topology of a contact network, several outstanding theoretical approaches have been developed. An accurate theoretical approach describing the spreading dynamics must take both the network topology and dynamical correlations into consideration at the expense of increasing the complexity of the equations. In this short survey we unify the most widely used theoretical approaches for epidemic spreading on complex networks in terms of increasing complexity, including the mean-field, the heterogeneous mean-field, the quench mean-field, dynamical message-passing, link percolation, and pairwise approximation. We build connections among these approaches to provide new insights into developing an accurate theoretical approach to spreading dynamics on complex networks.",0
"We study the phase structure of the 3D nonlocal compact U(1) lattice gauge theory coupled with a Higgs field by means of Monte-Carlo simulations. The nonlocal interactions among gauge variables are along the temporal direction and mimic the effect of local coupling to massless particles. We found that in contrast to the 3D local abelian Higgs model which has only one phase, the present model exhibits the confinement, Higgs, and Coulomb phases separated by three second-order transition lines emanating from a triple point. This result is quite important for studies on electron fractionalization phenomena in strongly-correlated electron systems. Implications to them are discussed.",0
"We report the results from our detailed analysis of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data for the pulsar binary PSR B1259-63/LS 2883. During the GeV flares that occurred when the pulsar was in the periastron passages, we have detected a 5--300 GeV component at $\simeq 5\sigma$ in emission from the binary. The detection verifies the presence of the component that has been marginally found in the previous studies of the binary. Furthermore, we have discovered that this component was present even in the quiescent state of the binary, specifically the mean anomaly phase 0.7--0.9. The component can be described by a power law with photon index $\Gamma\sim 1.4$, and the flux in the flares is approximately one order of magnitude higher than that in quiescence. We discuss the origin of this component. It likely arises from the inverse-Compton process: high-energy particles from the shock, due to the interaction between the winds from the pulsar and massive companion, scatter the seed photons from the companion to GeV/TeV energies. Based on this scenario, model fits to the broad-band X-ray--to--TeV spectra of the binary in the flaring and quiescent states are provided.",0
"In this paper, for any positive integer $n$, we study the Maslov-type index theory of $i_{L_0}$, $i_{L_1}$ and $i_{\sqrt{-1}}^{L_0}$ with $L_0=\{0\}\times \R^n\subset \R^{2n}$ and $L_1=\R^n\times \{0\} \subset \R^{2n}$. As applications we study the minimal period problems for brake orbits of nonlinear autonomous reversible Hamiltonian systems. For first order nonlinear autonomous reversible Hamiltonian systems in $\R^{2n}$, which are semipositive, and superquadratic at zero and infinity, we prove that for any $T>0$, the considered Hamiltonian systems possesses a nonconstant $T$ periodic brake orbit $X_T$ with minimal period no less than $\frac{T}{2n+2}$. Furthermore if $\int_0^T H""""_{22}(x_T(t))dt$ is positive definite, then the minimal period of $x_T$ belongs to $\{T,\;\frac{T}{2}\}$. Moreover, if the Hamiltonian system is even, we prove that for any $T>0$, the considered even semipositive Hamiltonian systems possesses a nonconstant symmetric brake orbit with minimal period belonging to $\{T,\;\frac{T}{3}\}$",0
We identify the driving mechanism of the gigantic Seebeck coefficient in FeSb$_2$ as the phonon-drag effect associated with an in-gap density of states that we demonstrate to derive from excess iron. We accurately model electronic and thermoelectric transport coefficients and explain the so far ill-understood correlation of maxima and inflection points in different response functions. Our scenario has far-reaching consequences for attempts to harvest the spectacular powerfactor of FeSb$_2$.,0
"We present a new method to compute the electronic structure of correlated materials combining the hybrid functional method with the dynamical mean-field theory. As a test example of the method we study cerium sesquioxide, a strongly correlated Mott-band insulator. The hybrid functional part improves the magnitude of the pd-band gap which is underestimated in the standard approximations to density functional theory while the dynamical mean-field theory part splits the 4f-electron spectra into a lower and an upper Hubbard band.",0
"Mechanism design is concerned with settings where a policy maker (or social planner) faces the problem of aggregating the announced preferences of multiple agents into a collective (or social), system-wide decision. One of the most important ways for aggregating preference that has been used in multiagent systems is election. In an election, the aim is to select the candidate who reflects the common will of society. Despite the importance of this subject, in real-world situations, under special circumstances, the result of the election does not respect the purpose of those who execute it and the election leads to the dissatisfaction of a large number of people and in some cases causes polarization in societies. To analyze these situations, we introduce notions called social frustration and social disappointment and show which voting rules can prevent them in elections. In addition, we propose new protocols to prevent social disappointment in elections. A version of the impossibility theorem is proved regarding social disappointment in elections, showing that there is no voting rule for four or more candidates that simultaneously satisfies avoiding social disappointment and Condorcet winner criteria. We empirically compared our protocols with seven well-known voting protocols and we observed that our protocols are capable of preventing social disappointment and are more robust against manipulations.",0
"M-theory suggests the study of 11-dimensional space-times compactified on some 7-manifolds. From its intimate relation to superstrings, one possible class of such 7-manifolds are those that have Calabi-Yau threefolds as boundary. In this article, we construct a special class of such 7-manifolds, named as {\it K3-Thurston} (K3T) 7-manifolds. The factor from the K3 part of the deformation space of these K3T 7-manifolds admits a K\""""{a}hler structure, while the factor of the deformation space from the Thurston part admits a special K\""""{a}hler structure. The latter rings with the nature of the scalar manifold of a vector multiplet in an N=2 $d=4$ supersymmetric gauge theory. Remarks and examples on more general K3T 7-manifolds and issues to possible interfaces of K3T to M-theory are also discussed.",0
"Unintegrated gluon distributions sensitive to the transverse spatial distribution of gluons in the proton are extracted from data on exclusive and diffractive final states at HERA in the dipole approach. These unintegrated gluon distributions can be used to compute inclusive hadron production in p+p collisions at the LHC. In this paper, we consider a number of saturation models with differering dynamical assumptions that give good fits to the available HERA data. We apply these models to study the rapidity and transverse momentum dependence of the LHC data up to $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV. We examine the sensitivity of these results to parameters that are not constrained by the HERA data and comment on similarities and differences with previous work. We compute the n-particle inclusive multiplicity distribution and show that the LHC p+p results are in agreement with predictions for multi-particle production in the Color Glass Condensate approach. This result has significant ramifications for the interpretation of multi-particle correlations in high multiplicity events at the LHC.",0
"We study the spectrum of the prompt emission and the X-ray and optical afterglow fluxes of 54 X-Ray Rich Gamma Ray Burst (XRRs) and X-Ray Flashes (XRFs), observed by BeppoSax and HETE-2. A comparison is then performed with classical Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs). The goal of this paper is to investigate the nature of XRRs/XRFs, as high redshift GRBs or off-axis GRBs, analyzing both their prompt and afterglow properties. We find that the XRR/XRF spectral indexes of the Band function are similar to those of classical GRBs, whereas the peak energy is lower by a factor of 4. We study the optical and X-Ray afterglow properties of the XRRs/XRFs; in particular we analyze the XRR 011030 afterglow. We find that the X-ray and optical flux distributions and the lightcurves of the XRRs/XRFs sample are consistent with those of classical GRBs; in particular, they show evidence of a break and no rising temporal slope. We compare these results with the afterglow predictions of the high redshift scenario, where XRFs are GRBs at higher redshift and of the off-axis scenario, where the observed differences are due to viewing angle effects. In this last framework, we consider jets with a homogeneous, a -2 power-law shaped and a Gaussian luminosity angular distribution. We find that the high redshift scenario can explain some events but not the total sample of XRRs/XRFs. The off-axis model may be consistent with our findings when a homogeneous jet is considered. However, given the uncertainties on the selection effects in our sample, a Gaussian jet viewed at small angles from the Gaussian core and a power-law shaped cannot be ruled out.",0
"A new type of field emission display(FED) based on an edge-enhance electron emission from metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) thin film structure is proposed. The electrons produced by an avalanche breakdown in the semiconductor near the edge of a top metal electrode are initially injected to the thin film of an insulator with a negative electron affinity (NEA), and then are injected into vacuum in proximity to the top electrode edge. The condition for the deep-depletition breakdown near the edge of the top metal electrode is analytically found in terms of ratio of the insulator thickness to the maximum (breakdown) width of the semiconductor depletition region: this ratio should be less than 2/(3 \pi - 2) = 0.27. The influence of a neighboring metal electrode and an electrode thickness on this condition are analyzed. Different practical schemes of the proposed display with a special reference to M/CaF_2/Si structure are considered.",0
"We revisit the notion of reduced spectra $sp_{\Cal {F}} (\phi)$ for bounded measurable functions $\phi \in L^{\infty} (J,\Bbb{X})$, ${\Cal {F}}\subset L^1_{loc}(J,\Bbb{X})$. We show that it can not be obtained via Carleman spectra unless $\phi\in BUC(J,\Bbb{X})$ and ${\Cal {F}} \subset BUC(J,\Bbb{X})$. In section 3, we give two examples which seem to be of independent interest for spectral theory. In section 4, we prove a spectral criteria for bounded mild solutions of evolution equation (*) $\frac{d u(t)}{dt}= A u(t) + \phi (t) $, $u(0)=x\in \Bbb{X}$, $t\in {J}$, where $A$ is a closed linear operator on $\Bbb{X}$ and $\phi\in L^{\infty} ({J}, \Bbb{X})$ where $ {J} \in\{\r_+,\r\}$.",0
"We study operators acting on a tensor product Hilbert space and investigate their product numerical range, product numerical radius and separable numerical range. Concrete bounds for the product numerical range for Hermitian operators are derived. Product numerical range of a non-Hermitian operator forms a subset of the standard numerical range containing the barycenter of the spectrum. While the latter set is convex, the product range needs not to be convex nor simply connected. The product numerical range of a tensor product is equal to the Minkowski product of numerical ranges of individual factors.",0
"In effective field theory physical quantities, in particular observables, are expressed as a power series in terms of a small expansion parameter. For non-perturbative systems, for instance nuclear physics, this requires the non-perturbative treatment of at least a part of the interaction (or the potential, if we are dealing with a non-relativistic system). This is not entirely trivial and as a consequence different interpretations on how to treat these systems have appeared. A practical approach is to expand the effective potential, where this potential is later fully iterated in the Schr\""""odinger equation for obtaining amplitudes and observables. The expectation is that this will lead to observables that will have an implicit power counting expansion. Here we explicitly check whether the amplitudes are actually following the same power counting as the potential. It happens that reality does not necessarily conform to expectations and the amplitudes will often violate the power counting with which the potential has been expanded. A more formal approach is to formulate the expansion directly in terms of amplitudes and observables, which is the original aim of the effective field theory idea. Yet this second approach is technically complicated. We explore here the possibility of constructing potentials that when fully iterated will make sure that amplitudes indeed are expansible in terms of a small expansion parameter.",0
"We report measurements of absolute transition frequencies and hyperfine coupling constants for the 8S_{1/2}, 9S_{1/2}, 7D_{3/2}, and 7D_{5/2} states in ^{133}Cs vapor. The stepwise excitation through either the 6P_{1/2} or 6P_{3/2} intermediate state is performed directly with broadband laser light from a stabilized femtosecond laser optical-frequency comb. The laser beam is split, counter-propagated and focused into a room-temperature Cs vapor cell. The repetition rate of the frequency comb is scanned and we detect the fluorescence on the 7P_{1/2,3/2} -> 6S_{1/2} branches of the decay of the excited states. The excitations to the different states are isolated by the introduction of narrow-bandwidth interference filters in the laser beam paths. Using a nonlinear least-squares method we find measurements of transition frequencies and hyperfine coupling constants that are in agreement with other recent measurements for the 8S state and provide improvement by two orders of magnitude over previously published results for the 9S and 7D states.",0
Mathematicians occasionally discover interesting truths even when they are playing with mathematical ideas with no thoughts about possible consequences of their actions. This paper describes two specific instances of this phenomenon. The discussion touches upon the theme of the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics as well as the ethical obligations of mathematicians.,0
"We investigate the importance of quantum orbital fluctuations in the orthorhombic and monoclinic phases of the Mott insulators LaVO3 and YVO3. First, we construct ab-initio material-specific t2g Hubbard models. Then, by using dynamical mean-field theory, we calculate the spectral matrix as a function of temperature. Our Hubbard bands and Mott gaps are in very good agreement with spectroscopy. We show that in orthorhombic LaVO3, quantum orbital fluctuations are strong and that they are suppressed only in the monoclinic 140 K phase. In YVO3 the suppression happens already at 300 K. We show that Jahn-Teller and GdFeO3-type distortions are both crucial in determining the type of orbital and magnetic order in the low temperature phases.",0
"The quantum cohomology algebra of a projective manifold X is the cohomology H(X,Q) endowed with a different algebra structure, which takes into account the geometry of rational curves in X. We show that this algebra takes a remarkably simple form for complete intersections when the dimension is large enough w.r.t. the degree. As a reward we get a number of surprising enumerative formulas relating lines, conics and twisted cubics on X.",0
"The lowest-lying collective modes of a trapped Bose gas in an optical lattice are studied in the Bose-Hubbard model. An exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian is performed in a one-dimensional five-particle system in order to find the lowest few eigenstates. Dipole and breathing character of the eigenstates is confirmed in the limit where the tunneling dominates the dynamics, but under Mott-like conditions the excitations do not correspond to oscillatory modes.",0
"Intraneural accumulation of misfolded proteins is a common feature of several neurodegenerative pathologies including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and Familial Encephalopathy with Neuroserpin Inclusion Bodies (FENIB). FENIB is a rare disease due to a point mutation in neuroserpin which accelerates protein aggregation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here we show that cholesterol depletion induced either by prolonged exposure to statins or by inhibiting the sterol regulatory binding-element protein (SREBP) pathway also enhances aggregation of neuroserpin proteins. These findings can be explained considering a computational model of protein aggregation under non-equilibrium conditions, where a decrease in the rate of protein clearance improves aggregation. Decreasing cholesterol in cell membranes affects their biophysical properties, including their ability to form the vesicles needed for protein clearance, as we illustrate by a simple mathematical model. Taken together, these results suggest that cholesterol reduction induces neuroserpin aggregation, even in absence of specific neuroserpin mutations. The new mechanism we uncover could be relevant also for other neurodegenerative diseases associated with protein aggregation.",0
"The Hipparcos catalog contains stars suspected to be {\delta} Scuti variables for which extensive ground-based observations and characterization of variability are necessary. Our aim was to characterize variability of 13 candidates to {\delta} Scuti type stars. We obtained 24 215 CCD images and analyzed stellar light curves using the Period04 program. Twelve {\delta} Scuti candidate stars have been characterized as pulsating with frequencies intrinsic to {\delta} Scuti stars: HIP 2923, HIP 5526, HIP 5659, HIP 11090, HIP 17585, HIP 74155, HIP 101473, HIP 106219, HIP 107786, HIP 113487, HIP 115093, HIP 115856. Five of them (HIP 2923, HIP 5526, HIP 11090, HIP 115856 and HIP 106219) may be hybrid {\delta} Scuti-{\gamma} Doradus pulsators. One more candidate, HIP 106223, is a variable star with longer periods of pulsations which are intrinsic to {\gamma} Doradus.",0
"The paper analyzes special cyclic Jacobi methods for symmetric matrices of order $4$. Only those cyclic pivot strategies that enable full parallelization of the method are considered. These strategies, unlike the serial pivot strategies, can force the method to be very slow or very fast within one cycle, depending on the underlying matrix. Hence, for the global convergence proof one has to consider two or three adjacent cycles. It is proved that for any symmetric matrix $A$ of order~$4$ the inequality $S(A^{[2]})\leq(1-10^{-5})S(A)$ holds, where $A^{[2]}$ results from $A$ by applying two cycles of a particular parallel method. Here $S(A)$ stands for the Frobenius norm of the strictly upper-triangular part of $A$. The result holds for two special parallel strategies and implies the global convergence of the method under all possible fully parallel strategies. It is also proved that for every $\epsilon>0$ and $n\geq4$ there exist a symmetric matrix $A(\epsilon)$ of order $n$ and a cyclic strategy, such that upon completion of the first cycle of the appropriate Jacobi method the inequality $S(A^{[1]})> (1-\epsilon)S(A(\epsilon))$ holds.",0
"By providing new insights into the distribution of a protein's torsion angles, recent statistical models for this data have pointed the way to more efficient methods for protein structure prediction. Most current approaches have concentrated on bivariate models at a single sequence position. There is, however, considerable value in simultaneously modeling angle pairs at multiple sequence positions in a protein. One area of application for such models is in structure prediction for the highly variable loop and turn regions. Such modeling is difficult due to the fact that the number of known protein structures available to estimate these torsion angle distributions is typically small. Furthermore, the data is """"sparse"""" in that not all proteins have angle pairs at each sequence position. We propose a new semiparametric model for the joint distributions of angle pairs at multiple sequence positions. Our model accommodates sparse data by leveraging known information about the behavior of protein secondary structure. We demonstrate our technique by predicting the torsion angles in a loop from the globin fold family. Our results show that a template-based approach can now be successfully extended to modeling the notoriously difficult loop and turn regions.",0
"A major stumbling block to progress in understanding basic human interactions, such as getting out of bed or opening a refrigerator, is lack of good training data. Most past efforts have gathered this data explicitly: starting with a laundry list of action labels, and then querying search engines for videos tagged with each label. In this work, we do the reverse and search implicitly: we start with a large collection of interaction-rich video data and then annotate and analyze it. We use Internet Lifestyle Vlogs as the source of surprisingly large and diverse interaction data. We show that by collecting the data first, we are able to achieve greater scale and far greater diversity in terms of actions and actors. Additionally, our data exposes biases built into common explicitly gathered data. We make sense of our data by analyzing the central component of interaction -- hands. We benchmark two tasks: identifying semantic object contact at the video level and non-semantic contact state at the frame level. We additionally demonstrate future prediction of hands.",0
"Let $\phi$ be a spherical Hecke-Maass cusp form on the non-compact space $\mathrm{PGL}_3(\mathbb{Z})\backslash\mathrm{PGL}_3(\mathbb{R})$. We establish various pointwise upper bounds for $\phi$ in terms of its Laplace eigenvalue $\lambda_\phi$. These imply, for $\phi$ arithmetically normalized and tempered at the archimedean place, the bound $\|\phi\|_\infty\ll_\epsilon \lambda_{\phi}^{39/40+\epsilon}$ for the global sup-norm (without restriction to a compact subset). On the way, we derive a new uniform upper bound for the $\mathrm{GL}_3$ Jacquet-Whittaker function.",0
"We improve the Sobolev-type embeddings due to Gagliardo and Nirenberg in the setting of rearrangement invariant (r.i.) spaces. In particular we concentrate on seeking the optimal domains and the optimal ranges for these embeddings between r.i. spaces and mixed norm spaces. As a consequence, we prove that the classical estimate for the standard Sobolev space by Poornima, O'Neil and Peetre (1 <=p<n), and by Hansson, Brezis and Wainger and Maz'ya (p=n) can be further strengthened by considering mixed norms on the target spaces.",0
"In this paper, a stabilized second order in time accurate linear exponential time differencing (ETD) scheme for the no-slope-selection thin film growth model is presented. An artificial stabilizing term $A\tau^2\frac{\partial\Delta^2 u}{\partial t}$ is added to the physical model to achieve energy stability, with ETD-based multi-step approximations and Fourier collocation spectral method applied in the time integral and spatial discretization of the evolution equation, respectively. Long time energy stability and detailed $\ell^{\infty}(0,T; \ell^2)$ error analysis are provided based on the energy method, with a careful estimate of the aliasing error. In addition, numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the energy decay and convergence rate.",0
"A number of approaches to the arrival time problem employ a complex potential of a simple step function type and the arrival time distribution may then be calculated using the stationary scattering wave functions. Here, it is shown that in the Zeno limit (in which the potential becomes very large), the arrival time distribution may be obtained in a clear and simple way using a path integral representation of the propagator together with the path decomposition expansion (in which the propagator is factored across a surface of constant time). This method also shows that the same result is obtained for a wide class of complex potentials.",0
"Learning can be seen as approximating an unknown function by interpolating the training data. Kriging offers a solution to this problem based on the prior specification of a kernel. We explore a numerical approximation approach to kernel selection/construction based on the simple premise that a kernel must be good if the number of interpolation points can be halved without significant loss in accuracy (measured using the intrinsic RKHS norm $\|\cdot\|$ associated with the kernel). We first test and motivate this idea on a simple problem of recovering the Green's function of an elliptic PDE (with inhomogeneous coefficients) from the sparse observation of one of its solutions. Next we consider the problem of learning non-parametric families of deep kernels of the form $K_1(F_n(x),F_n(x'))$ with $F_{n+1}=(I_d+\epsilon G_{n+1})\circ F_n$ and $G_{n+1} \in \operatorname{Span}\{K_1(F_n(x_i),\cdot)\}$. With the proposed approach constructing the kernel becomes equivalent to integrating a stochastic data driven dynamical system, which allows for the training of very deep (bottomless) networks and the exploration of their properties. These networks learn by constructing flow maps in the kernel and input spaces via incremental data-dependent deformations/perturbations (appearing as the cooperative counterpart of adversarial examples) and, at profound depths, they (1) can achieve accurate classification from only one data point per class (2) appear to learn archetypes of each class (3) expand distances between points that are in different classes and contract distances between points in the same class. For kernels parameterized by the weights of Convolutional Neural Networks, minimizing approximation errors incurred by halving random subsets of interpolation points, appears to outperform training (the same CNN architecture) with relative entropy and dropout.",0

"This paper deals with the problem of string stability in a chain of acceleration-controlled vehicles. It is known that string stability cannot be achieved, with any linear controller, when the vehicles' control inputs are based on relative distances to a fixed number of predecessors. We extend the set of impossible settings by including elements like dynamic sensor parts and local inter-vehicular communication, as in cooperative adaptive cruise control. It is also known that a weaker form of string stability is achievable by adding absolute velocity measurements (e.g. """"time-headway"""" policy). We show that a stronger property can also be achieved, provided steady-state control gain is infinite e.g. by using integral control.",0
"Since 1995, more than 1500 exoplanets have been discovered around a large diversity of host stars (from M- to A-type stars). Tidal dissipation in stellar convective envelopes is a key actor that shapes the orbital architecture of short-period systems. Our objective is to understand and evaluate how tidal dissipation in the convective envelope of low-mass stars (from M to F types) depends on their mass, evolutionary stage and rotation. Using a simplified two-layer assumption, we compute analytically the frequency-averaged tidal dissipation in their convective envelope. This dissipation is due to the conversion into heat of the kinetic energy of tidal non wave-like/equilibrium flow and inertial waves because of the viscous friction applied by turbulent convection. Using grids of stellar models allows us to study the variation of the dissipation as a function of stellar mass and age on the Pre-Main-Sequence and on the Main-Sequence for stars with masses spanning from $0.4$ to $1.4M_{\odot}$. As shown by observations, tidal dissipation in stars varies over several orders of magnitude as a function of stellar mass, age and rotation. During their Pre-Main-Sequence, all low-mass stars have an increase of the frequency-averaged tidal dissipation for a fixed angular velocity in their convective envelope until they reach a critical aspect and mass ratios. Next, the dissipation evolves on the Main Sequence to an asymptotic value that becomes maximum for $0.6M_{\odot}$ K-type stars and that decreases by several orders of magnitude with increasing stellar mass. Finally, the rotational evolution of low-mass stars strengthens the importance of tidal dissipation during the Pre-Main-Sequence for star-planet and multiple star systems.",0
"This paper reviews recent advances in photonic-assisted radio-frequency arbitrary waveform generation (RF-AWG), with emphasis on programmable ultrabroadband microwave and millimeter-wave waveforms. The key enabling components in these techniques are programmable optical pulse shaping, frequency-to-time mapping via dispersive propagation, and high-speed photodetection. The main advantages and challenges of several different photonic RF-AWG schemes are discussed. We further review some proof-of-concept demonstrations of ultrabroadband RF-AWG applications, including high-resolution ranging and ultrabroadband non-line-of-sight channel compensation. Finally, we present recent progress toward RF-AWG with increased time aperture and time-bandwidth product.",0
"Strong charge-spin coupling is found in a layered transition-metal trichalcogenide NiPS3, a van derWaals antiferromagnet, from our study of the electronic structure using several experimental and theoretical tools: spectroscopic ellipsometry, x-ray absorption and photoemission spectroscopy, and density-functional calculations. NiPS3 displays an anomalous shift in the optical spectral weight at the magnetic ordering temperature, reflecting a strong coupling between the electronic and magnetic structures. X-ray absorption, photoemission and optical spectra support a self-doped ground state in NiPS3. Our work demonstrates that layered transition-metal trichalcogenide magnets are a useful candidate for the study of correlated-electron physics in two-dimensional magnetic material.",0
"In this first of two papers, we present a new method for searching for oscillatory features in the primordial power spectrum. A wide variety of models predict these features in one of two different flavors: logarithmically spaced oscillations and linearly spaced oscillations. The proposed method treats the oscillations as perturbations on top of the scale-invariant power spectrum, allowing us to vary all cosmological parameters. This perturbative approach reduces the computational requirements for the search as the transfer functions and their derivatives can be precomputed. We show that the most significant degeneracy in the analysis is between the distance to last scattering and the overall amplitude at low frequencies. For models with logarithmic oscillations, this degeneracy leads to an uncertainty in the phase. For linear spaced oscillations, it affects the frequency of the oscillations. In this first of two papers, we test our code on simulated Planck-like data, and show we are able to recover fiducial input oscillations with an amplitude of a few times order 10^{-2}. We apply the code to WMAP9-year data and confirm the existence of two intriguing resonant frequencies for log spaced oscillations. For linear spaced oscillations we find a single resonance peak. We use numerical simulations to assess the significance of these features and conclude that the data do not provide compelling evidence for the existence of oscillatory features in the primordial spectrum.",0
"Business Intelligence, not as a tool of a product but as a new approach is propounded in organizations to make tough decisions in business as shortly as possible. Hospital managers often need business intelligence in their fiscal, operational, and clinical reports and indices. The main goal of recognition and ranking CSF is implementation of a business intelligent system in hospitals to increase success factor of application of business intelligence in health and treatment sector. This paper is an application and descriptive-analytical one, in which we use questionnaires to gather data and we used SPSS and LISREL to analyze them. Its statistical society is managers and personnel of Hasheminejad hospital and case studies are selected by Cochran formula. The findings show that all three organizational, process, and technological factors equally affect implementation of business intelligence based on Yeoh & Koronis approach, where the assumptions are based upon it. The proposed model for CSFs of business intelligence in hospitals include: declaring perspective, goals and strategies, development of human and financial resources, clarification of organizational culture, documentation and process mature, management support, etc. Business intelligence implementation is affected by different components. Center of Hasheminejad hospital BI system as a leader in providing quality health care, partially succeeded to take advantage of the benefits the organization in passing the information revolution but the development of this system to achieve intelligent hospital and its certainty is a high priority, thus it can`t be said that the hospital-wide BI system is quite favorable. In this regard, it can be concluded that Hasheminejad hospital requires practical model for business intelligence systems development.",0
"Let X be a compact oriented Riemannian manifold and let $\phi:X\to S^1$ be a circle-valued Morse function. Under some mild assumptions on $\phi$, we prove a formula relating: (a) the number of closed orbits of the gradient flow of $\phi$ of any given degree; (b) the torsion of a ``Morse complex'', which counts gradient flow lines between critical points of $\phi$; and (c) a kind of Reidemeister torsion of X determined by the homotopy class of $\phi$. When $\dim(X)=3$ and $b_1(X)>0$, we state a conjecture analogous to Taubes's ``SW=Gromov'' theorem, and we use it to deduce (for closed manifolds, modulo signs) the Meng-Taubes relation between the Seiberg- Witten invariants and the ``Milnor torsion'' of X.",0
"One of the main goals of the study of high transverse momentum (P_T) observables in the context of ultrarelativisic heavy-ion collisions is the determination of properties of the produced QCD matter. In particular, the transport coefficients qhat and ehat, characterizing the interaction of the medium with a high p_T parton, are accessible via high P_T probes. However, a precision extraction of their temperature dependence from current data faces the problem that neither the spacetime geometry of the evolving matter droplet nor the link between thermodynamics and transport coefficients is unambiguously known, and various conjectured scenarios how thermodynamics and transport coefficients behave close to the phase transition exist. While often a behaviour with the energy density qhat ~ epsilon^3/4 is assumed which leads to a parametric decrease of the scaled qhat(T)/T^3 close to the critical temperature T_C, other scenarios expect instead a near T_C enhancement of jet quenching. In this work, the systematic response of both the extraction of qhat and v_2 at high P_T to modification of jet quenching close to T_C is systematically investigated within YaJEM, a well-tested in-medium shower evolution Monte-Carlo (MC) code.",0
"This work addresses the problem of transient stabilization of a power grid, following a destabilizing disturbance. The model considered is the cascade interconnection of seven New England test models with the disturbance (e.g., a powerline failure) occurring in the first grid and propagating forward, emulating a wide-area blackout. We consider a data-driven control framework based on the Koopman operator theory, where a linear predictor, evolving on a higher dimensional (embedded) state-space, is built from observed data and subsequently used within a model predictive control (MPC) framework, allowing for the use of efficient computational tools of linear MPC to control this highly nonlinear dynamical system.",0
"This thesis deals with the problem of singularities in a family of extensions of General Relativity in the Metric-Affine formalism. I introduce the Metric-Affine formalism as a framework in which study extensions of GR. I review its features and motivate it through its application in Bravais crystals, where ideal crystals can be described through Riemannian formalism, but a crystal with defects have to be described with in terms of an independent connection. The simplest way to construct solutions different from GR in this formalism is to take a quadratic gravity lagrangian with an electrovacuum stress-energy tensor. This way, charged black hole solutions are obtained. The geometry of these new charged black hole solutions is analysed. Far from the sources, the geometry of these new solutions is equal to the GR one up to $1/r^4$ corrections. However, instead of a central singularity, they have a wormhole structure, which can be completely regular or where the curvature scalars diverge, depending on the mass and charge of the black hole. I study the geodesics around the wormhole throat and conclude that the geodesics are always complete even in the case of a curvature divergence. To analyse in more detail the geometry, I also study the evolution of a scalar wave sent towards the wormhole. The evolution is shown to be regular and I calculate the transmission coefficients and transmission cross section for a naked wormhole. Finally, I study the same case for a Born-Infeld lagrangian in an arbitrary number of dimension ($d>4$). In this setting, the wormhole structure is also present and the geodesics are still complete, therefore showing that the metric-affine formalism can resolve singularities for a variety of models, and is not a particular feature of the quadratic Lagrangian for $d=4$.",0
"Early sensory deprivation such as blindness or deafness shapes brain development in multiple ways. While it is established that deprived brain areas start to be engaged in the processing of stimuli from the remaining modalities and in high-level cognitive tasks, some reports have also suggested the possibility of structural and functional changes in non-deprived brain areas. We compared resting-state functional network organization of the brain in early-deaf adults and hearing controls by examining global network segregation and integration. Relative to hearing controls, deaf adults exhibited an altered modular organization, with regions of the salience network coupled with the fronto-parietal network. They showed weaker connections between auditory and somatomotor regions, stronger coupling between the fronto-parietal network and several other large-scale networks (visual, memory, cingulo-opercular and somatomotor), and an enlargement of the default mode network. Their overall functional segregation of brain networks was also lower. Our findings suggest that brain plasticity in deaf adults is not limited to changes in auditory cortex but additionally alters the coupling between other large-scale networks. These widespread functional connectivity changes may provide a mechanism for the superior behavioral performance of the deaf in visual and attentional tasks.",0
"An asymmetric \b{eta}-sheet structure of spider silk is said to induce optical second harmonic generation. In this paper, using an in-house non-scanning type femtosecond pulse laser second harmonic generation microscope, we characterized the behavior of the \b{eta}-sheet of spider silk under an applied external force. The orientation of the \b{eta}-sheets was more unidirectional when the silk was extended. One of the origins of the high mechanical strength of the dragline is suggested to be the physical arrangement of its \b{eta}-sheets.",0
"This paper presents relevant modern mathematical formulations for (classical) gauge field theories, namely, ordinary differential geometry, noncommutative geometry, and transitive Lie algebroids. They provide rigorous frameworks to describe Yang-Mills-Higgs theories or gravitation theories, and each of them improves the paradigm of gauge field theories. A brief comparison between them is carried out, essentially due to the various notions of connection. However they reveal a compelling common mathematical pattern on which the paper concludes.",0
"We study theoretically and numerically the steady state diffusion controlled reaction $A+B\rightarrow\emptyset$, where currents $J$ of $A$ and $B$ particles are applied at opposite boundaries. For a reaction rate $\lambda$, and equal diffusion constants $D$, we find that when $\lambda J^{-1/2} D^{-1/2}\ll 1$ the reaction front is well described by mean field theory. However, for $\lambda J^{-1/2} D^{-1/2}\gg 1$, the front acquires a Gaussian profile - a result of noise induced wandering of the reaction front center. We make a theoretical prediction for this profile which is in good agreement with simulation. Finally, we investigate the intrinsic (non-wandering) front width and find results consistent with scaling and field theoretic predictions.",0
"In this philosophical paper, we explore computational and biological analogies to address the fine-tuning problem in cosmology. We first clarify what it means for physical constants or initial conditions to be fine-tuned. We review important distinctions such as the dimensionless and dimensional physical constants, and the classification of constants proposed by Levy-Leblond. Then we explore how two great analogies, computational and biological, can give new insights into our problem. This paper includes a preliminary study to examine the two analogies. Importantly, analogies are both useful and fundamental cognitive tools, but can also be misused or misinterpreted. The idea that our universe might be modelled as a computational entity is analysed, and we discuss the distinction between physical laws and initial conditions using algorithmic information theory. Smolin introduced the theory of """"Cosmological Natural Selection"""" with a biological analogy in mind. We examine an extension of this analogy involving intelligent life. We discuss if and how this extension could be legitimated. Keywords: origin of the universe, fine-tuning, physical constants, initial conditions, computational universe, biological universe, role of intelligent life, cosmological natural selection, cosmological artificial selection, artificial cosmogenesis.",0
In the 2-dimensional anisotropic Heisenberg model with XY-symmetry there are non-planar vortices which exhibit a localized structure of the z-components of the spins around the vortex center. We study how thermal noise induces a transition of this structure from one polarization to the opposite one. We describe the vortex core by a discrete Hamiltonian and consider a stationary solution of the Fokker-Planck equation. We find a bimodal distribution function and calculate the transition rate using Langer's instanton theory (1969). The result is compared with Langevin dynamics simulations for the full many-spin model.,0
"In 2010, Tom Halverson and Georgia Benkart introduced the Motzkin algebra, a generalization of the Temperley-Lieb algebra, whose elements are diagrams that can be multiplied by stacking one on top of the other. Halverson and Benkart gave a diagrammatic algorithm for decomposing any Motzkin diagram into diagrams of three subalgebras: the Right Planar Rook algebra, the Temperley-Lieb algebra, and the Left Planar Rook algebra. We first explore the Right and Left Planar Rook monoids, by finding presentations for these monoids by generators and relations, using a counting argument to prove that our relations suffice. We then turn to the newly-developed Motzkin monoid, where we describe Halverson's decomposition algorithm algebraically, find a presentation by generators and relations, and use a counting argument but with a much more sophisticated algorithm.",0
"Incident angle dependence of reactions between graphene and hydrogen atoms are obtained qualitatively by classical molecular dynamics simulation under the NVE condition with modified Brenner reactive empirical bond order (REBO) potential. Chemical reaction depends on two parameters, i.e., polar angle $\theta$ and azimuthal angle $\phi$ of the incident hydrogen. From the simulation results, it is found that the reaction rates strongly depend on polar angle $\theta$. Reflection rate becomes larger with increasing $\theta$, and the $\theta$ dependence of adsorption rate is also found. The $\theta$ dependence is caused by three dimensional structure of the small potential barrier which covers adsorption sites. $\phi$ dependence of penetration rate is also found for large $\theta$.",0
"We propose two novel manipulation strategies for increasing and decreasing the difficulty of C-tests automatically. This is a crucial step towards generating learner-adaptive exercises for self-directed language learning and preparing language assessment tests. To reach the desired difficulty level, we manipulate the size and the distribution of gaps based on absolute and relative gap difficulty predictions. We evaluate our approach in corpus-based experiments and in a user study with 60 participants. We find that both strategies are able to generate C-tests with the desired difficulty level.",0
"We present RSLR, an implicit higher-order characterization of the class PP of those problems which can be decided in probabilistic polynomial time with error probability smaller than 1/2. Analogously, a (less implicit) characterization of the class BPP can be obtained. RSLR is an extension of Hofmann's SLR with a probabilistic primitive, which enjoys basic properties such as subject reduction and confluence. Polynomial time soundness of RSLR is obtained by syntactical means, as opposed to the standard literature on SLR-derived systems, which use semantics in an essential way.",0
"We present exact analytical black hole solutions with conformal anomaly in AdS space and discuss the thermodynamical properties of these black hole solutions. These black holes can have a positive, zero and negative constant curvature horizon, respectively. For the black hole with a positive constant curvature horizon, there exists a minimal horizon determined by the coefficient of the trace anomaly, the black hole with a smaller horizon is thermodynamically unstable, while it is stable for the case with a larger horizon. The Hawking-Page transition happens in this case. For the black hole with a Ricci flat horizon, the black hole is always thermodynamically stable and there is no Hawking-Page transition. In the case of the black hole with a negative constant curvature horizon, there exists a critical value for the coefficient of the trace anomaly, under this critical value, the black hole is always thermodynamical stable and the Hawking-Page transition does not happen. When the coefficient is beyond the critical value, the black hole with a smaller horizon is thermodynamically unstable, but it becomes stable for the case with a larger horizon, the Hawking-Page transition always happens in this case. The latter is a new feature for the black holes with a negative constant curvature horizon.",0

"Finding an optimal key assignment (subject to given constraints) for a key predistribution scheme in wireless sensor networks is a difficult task. Hence, most of the practical schemes are based on probabilistic key assignment, which leads to sub-optimal schemes requiring key storage linear in the total number of nodes. A graph theoretic framework is introduced to study the fundamental tradeoffs between key storage, average key path length (directly related to the battery consumption) and resilience (to compromised nodes) of key predistribution schemes for wireless sensor networks. Based on the proposed framework, a lower bound on key storage is derived for a given average key path length. An upper bound on the compromising probability is also given. This framework also leads to the design of key assignment schemes with a storage complexity of the same order as the lower bound.",0
"We clarify the relationship between different multiple polylogarithms in weight~4 by writing suitable linear combinations of a given type of iterated integral I_{n_1,...,n_d}(z_1,...,z_d), in depth d>1 and weight \sum_i n_i=4 in terms of the classical tetralogarithm Li_4. In the process, we prove a statement conjectured by Goncharov which can be rephrased as writing the sum of iterated integrals I_{3,1}(V(x,y),z), where V(x,y) denotes a formal version of the five term relation for the dilogarithm, in terms of Li_4-terms (we need 122 such).",0
"Extracting shape information from object bound- aries is a well studied problem in vision, and has found tremen- dous use in applications like object recognition. Conversely, studying the space of shapes represented by curves satisfying certain constraints is also intriguing. In this paper, we model and analyze the space of shapes represented by a 3D curve (space curve) formed by connecting n pieces of quarter of a unit circle. Such a space curve is what we call a Tangle, the name coming from a toy built on the same principle. We provide two models for the shape space of n-link open and closed tangles, and we show that tangles are a subset of trigonometric splines of a certain order. We give algorithms for curve approximation using open/closed tangles, computing geodesics on these shape spaces, and to find the deformation that takes one given tangle to another given tangle, i.e., the Log map. The algorithms provided yield tangles upto a small and acceptable tolerance, as shown by the results given in the paper.",0
"As a pilot survey for the forthcoming 6dF Galaxy Redshift Survey, spectroscopy of galaxies selected in J (1.2 mu) with the DENIS survey was performed at the UKST using the FLAIR II multi-object spectroscope. 69 galaxy redshifts (z's) were obtained in a high |b| field and an additional 12 z's in a low latitude (b=-17 deg), obscured field. This study illustrates the feasibility of obtaining z's with optical spectra on galaxies selected at much longer wavelengths. It validated a very preliminary algorithm for star/galaxy separation for high |b| DENIS objects, with 99% reliability for J < 13.9. However, the FLAIR II z determinations required substantially longer integration times to achieve 90% completeness than expected from previous optical surveys at comparable depth. This is mainly due to a degradation in overall fibre throughput due to known problems with ageing of the prism-cement-fibre interface with exposure to UV light. Our low |b| (high extinction) field required 2.5 times more exposure time for less than 50% of successful z measurements. Among the J <= 13.9 galaxies with measured z's, only 37+/-6% display emission lines, in comparison with 60% of emission-line galaxies (ELGs) in optical samples of comparable depth. The ELGs are, on average, 0.5 mag bluer in B-J than non-ELGs of the same luminosity. We confirm a previous optically-based result that the fraction of ELGs increases rapidly with decreasing galaxy luminosity. The J-band luminosity function is estimated. Our high latitude field displays a concentration of galaxies at cz ~ 38000 km/s suggesting a possible supercluster. A radial velocity is reported for a galaxy lying near the projected centre of the Abell 1434 cluster of galaxies, for which no cluster z is currently available.",0
"The production of charged pions, kaons and (anti)protons has been measured at mid-rapidity ($-0.5 < y < 0$) in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV using the ALICE detector at the LHC. Exploiting particle identification capabilities at high transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$), the previously published $p_{\rm T}$ spectra have been extended to include measurements up to 20 GeV/$c$ for seven event multiplicity classes. The $p_{\rm T}$ spectra for pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV, needed to interpolate a pp reference spectrum, have also been extended up to 20 GeV/$c$ to measure the nuclear modification factor ($R_{\rm pPb}$) in non-single diffractive p-Pb collisions. At intermediate transverse momentum ($2 < p_{\rm T} < 10$\,GeV/$c$) the proton-to-pion ratio increases with multiplicity in p-Pb collisions, a similar effect is not present in the kaon-to-pion ratio. The $p_{\rm T}$ dependent structure of such increase is qualitatively similar to those observed in pp and heavy-ion collisions. At high $p_{\rm T}$ ($>10$ GeV/$c$), the particle ratios are consistent with those reported for pp and Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC energies. At intermediate $p_{\rm T}$ the (anti)proton $R_{\rm pPb}$ shows a Cronin-like enhancement, while pions and kaons show little or no nuclear modification. At high $p_{\rm T}$ the charged pion, kaon and (anti)proton $R_{\rm pPb}$ are consistent with unity within statistical and systematic uncertainties.",0
In this letter we present some new results on modular theory and its application in quantum field theory. In doing this we develop some new proposals how to generalize concepts of geometrical action. Therefore the spirit of this letter is more on a programmatic side with many details remaining to be elaborated.,0
"The fractional Aharonov-Bohm oscillation (FABO) of narrow quantum rings with two electrons has been studied and has been explained in an analytical way, the evolution of the period and amplitudes against the magnetic field can be exactly described. Furthermore, the dipole transition of the ground state was found to have essentially two frequencies, their difference appears as an oscillation matching the oscillation of the persistent current exactly. A number of equalities relating the observables and dynamical parameters have been found.",0
"The bond order wave (BOW) phase of half-filled linear Hubbard-type models is narrow and difficult to characterize aside from a few ground state properties. The BOW phase of a frustrated Heisenberg spin chain is wide and tractable. It has broken inversion symmetry C_i in a regular array and finite gap E_m to the lowest triplet state. The spin-BOW is exact in finite systems at a special point. Its elementary excitations are spin-1/2 solitons that connect BOWs with opposite phase. The same patterns of spin densities and bond orders appear in the BOW phase of Hubbard-type models. Infrared (IR) active lattice phonons or molecular vibrations are derivatives of P, the polarization along the stack. Molecular vibrations that are forbidden in regular arrays become IR active when C_i symmetry is broken. 1:1 alkali-TCNQ salts contain half-filled regular TCNQ- stacks at high temperature, down to 100 K in the Rb-TCNQ(II) polymorph whose magnetic susceptibility and polarized IR spectra indicate a BOW phase. More complete modeling will require explicit electronic coupling to phonons and molecular vibrations.",0
"We introduce a class of Adapted Increasingly Rarely Markov Chain Monte Carlo (AirMCMC) algorithms where the underlying Markov kernel is allowed to be changed based on the whole available chain output but only at specific time points separated by an increasing number of iterations. The main motivation is the ease of analysis of such algorithms. Under the assumption of either simultaneous or (weaker) local simultaneous geometric drift condition, or simultaneous polynomial drift we prove the $L_2-$convergence, Weak and Strong Laws of Large Numbers (WLLN, SLLN), Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and discuss how our approach extends the existing results. We argue that many of the known Adaptive MCMC algorithms may be transformed into the corresponding Air versions, and provide an empirical evidence that performance of the Air version stays virtually the same.",0
"This paper focuses on two main issues; first one is the impact of combination of multi-sensor images on the supervised learning classification accuracy using segment Fusion (SF). The second issue attempts to undertake the study of supervised machine learning classification technique of remote sensing images by using four classifiers like Parallelepiped (Pp), Mahalanobis Distance (MD), Maximum-Likelihood (ML) and Euclidean Distance(ED) classifiers, and their accuracies have been evaluated on their respected classification to choose the best technique for classification of remote sensing images. QuickBird multispectral data (MS) and panchromatic data (PAN) have been used in this study to demonstrate the enhancement and accuracy assessment of fused image over the original images using ALwassaiProcess software. According to experimental result of this study, is that the test results indicate the supervised classification results of fusion image, which generated better than the MS did. As well as the result with Euclidean classifier is robust and provides better results than the other classifiers do, despite of the popular belief that the maximum-likelihood classifier is the most accurate classifier.",0
"We present a phenomenological study of a CP-violating two-Higgs-doublet Model with type-II Yukawa couplings at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In the light of recent LHC data, we focus on the parameter space that survives the current and past experimental constraints as well as theoretical bounds on the model. Once the phenomenological scenario is set, we analyse the scope of the LHC in exploring this model through the discovery of a charged Higgs boson produced in association with a W boson, with the former decaying into the lightest neutral Higgs and a second W state, altogether yielding a b\bar b W^+W^- signature, of which we exploit the W^+W^- semileptonic decays.",0
"Using an analysis similar to that of Imry and Wortis, it is shown that the apparent first order superconductor to metal transition, which has been claimed to exist at low values of the magnetic field in a two-dimensional field-tuned system at zero temperature,can be consistentlyinterpreted as a sharp crossover from a strong superconductor to an inhomogeneous state, which is a weak superconductor. The true zero-temperature superconductor to insulator transition within the inhomogenous state is conjectured to be that of randomly diluted XY model. An explaination of the observed finite temperature approximate scaling of resistivity close to the critical point is speculated within this model.",0
"A new qualitative stringlike picture for mesons is proposed which leads to a simple and intuitively clear generalization of linear radial Regge trajectories to the case of massive quarks. The obtained universal relation is successfully tested in the sector of unflavored vector mesons, where many radial excitations are known. Some new predictions are given. Our results suggest that the quark masses can be easily estimated from the spectra of radially excited mesons.",0
"Many common graph data mining tasks take the form of identifying dense subgraphs (e.g. clustering, clique-finding, etc). In biological applications, the natural model for these dense substructures is often a complete bipartite graph (biclique), and the problem requires enumerating all maximal bicliques (instead of just identifying the largest or densest). The best known algorithm in general graphs is due to Dias et al., and runs in time O(M |V|^4 ), where M is the number of maximal induced bicliques (MIBs) in the graph. When the graph being searched is itself bipartite, Zhang et al. give a faster algorithm where the time per MIB depends on the number of edges in the graph. In this work, we present a new algorithm for enumerating MIBs in general graphs, whose run time depends on how """"close to bipartite"""" the input is. Specifically, the runtime is parameterized by the size k of an odd cycle transversal (OCT), a vertex set whose deletion results in a bipartite graph. Our algorithm runs in time O(M |V||E|k^2 3^(k/3) ), which is an improvement on Dias et al. whenever k <= 3log_3(|V|). We implement our algorithm alongside a variant of Dias et al.'s in open-source C++ code, and experimentally verify that the OCT-based approach is faster in practice on graphs with a wide variety of sizes, densities, and OCT decompositions.",0
"Hybrid silicon pixel detectors are currently used in the innermost tracking system of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment. Radiation tolerance up to fluences expected for a few years of running of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has already been proved, although some degradation of the part of the silicon detector closer to the interaction point is expected. During the LHC upgrade phases, the level of dose foreseen for the silicon pixel detector will be much higher. To face this aspect, dedicated irradiation tests with fluences above $\mathcal{O}(10^{15})$ n$_{\textrm{eq}}$/cm$^2$ have been performed on the silicon sensor and readout chip. Changes in the operation of the sensor and readout chip as a function of the fluence are presented. The charge collection efficiency has been studied: partial recovery of the detector efficiency can be achieved by operating the detectors in a controlled environment and at higher bias voltage.",0
"We present a holographic realization of large Nc massless QCD in two dimensions using a D2/D8 brane construction. The flavor axial anomaly is dual to a three dimensional Chern-Simons term which turns out to be of leading order, and it affects the meson spectrum and holographic renormalization in crucial ways. The massless flavor bosons that exist in the spectrum are found to decouple from the heavier mesons, in agreement with the general lore of non-Abelian bosonization. We also show that an external dynamical photon acquires a mass through the three dimensional Chern-Simons term as expected from the Schwinger mechanism. Massless two dimensional QCD at large Nc exhibits anti-vector-meson dominance due to the axial anomaly.",0
"One of the primary aspects of sustainable development involves accurate understanding and modeling of environmental phenomena. Many of these phenomena exhibit variations in both space and time and it is imperative to develop a deeper understanding of techniques that can model space-time dynamics accurately. In this paper we propose NOSTILL-GP - NOn-stationary Space TIme variable Latent Length scale GP, a generic non-stationary, spatio-temporal Gaussian Process (GP) model. We present several strategies, for efficient training of our model, necessary for real-world applicability. Extensive empirical validation is performed using three real-world environmental monitoring datasets, with diverse dynamics across space and time. Results from the experiments clearly demonstrate general applicability and effectiveness of our approach for applications in environmental monitoring.",0
"We propose a new multi-component two-dimensional Toda lattice hierarchy (mc2dTLH) which includes two-dimensional Toda lattice equation with self-consistent sources (2dTLSCS) as the first non-trivial equation. The Lax representations for this mc2dTLH are presented. We construct a non-auto-B\""""acklund Darboux transformation (DT) for 2dTLSCS by applying the method of variation of constant (MVC) to ordinary DT of 2dTLSCS. This non-auto-B\""""acklund DT enables us to obtain various solutions such as solitons, rational solutions etc., to 2dTLSCS.",0
"The goal of these notes is to fill some gaps in the literature about random walks in the Cauchy domain of attraction, which has been in many cases left aside because of its additional technical difficulties. We prove here several results in that case: a Fuk-Nagaev inequality and a local version of it ; a large deviation theorem ; two types of local large deviation theorems. We also derive two important applications of these results: a sharp estimate of the tail of the first ladder epochs, and renewal theorems -- extending standard renewal theorems to the case of random walks. Most of our techniques carry through to the case of random walks in the domain of attraction of an $\alpha$-stable law with $\alpha \in(0,2)$, so we also present results in that case, since some of them seem to be missing in the literature.",0
"Double-lobed radio galaxies a few 100s of kpc in extent, like Cygnus A, are common at redshifts of 1 to 2, arising from some 10 per cent of the most powerful Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). At higher redshifts they are rare, with none larger than a few 10s of kpc known above redshift z~4. Recent studies of the redshift evolution of powerful-jetted objects indicate that they may constitute a larger fraction of the AGN population above redshift 2 than appears from a simple consideration of detected GHz radio sources. The radio band is misleading as the dramatic (1+z)^4 boost in the energy density of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) causes inverse Compton scattering to dominate the energy losses of relativistic electrons in the extended lobes produced by jets, making them strong X-ray, rather than radio, sources. Here we investigate limits to X-ray lobes around two distant quasars, ULASJ112001.48+064124.3 at z = 7.1 and SDSSJ1030+0524 at z=6.3, and find that powerful jets could be operating yet be currently undetectable. Jets may be instrumental in the rapid build-up of billion Msun black hole at a rate that violates the Eddington limit.",0
"In this paper, we give explicit rates in the central limit theorem and in the almost sure invariance principle for general R d-valued cocycles that appear in the study of the left random walk on linear groups. Our method of proof lies on a suitable martingale approximation and on a careful estimation of some coupling coefficients linked with the underlying Markov structure. Concerning the martingale part, the available results in the literature are not accurate enough to give almost optimal rates whether in the central limit theorem for the Wasserstein distance, or in the strong approximation. A part of this paper is devoted to circumvent this issue. We then exhibit near optimal rates both in the central limit theorem in terms of Wasserstein distance and in the almost sure invariance principle for R d-valued martingales with stationary increments having moments of order p $\in$]2, 3] (the case of sequences of reversed martingale differences is also considered). Note also that, as an application of our results for general R d-valued cocycles, a special attention is paid to the Iwasawa cocycle and the Cartan projection for reductive Lie groups.",0
"Let $ \lambda ^2 \in \mathbb N $, and in dimensions $ d\geq 5$, let $ A_{\lambda } f (x)$ denote the average of $ f \;:\; \mathbb Z ^{d} \to \mathbb R $ over the lattice points on the sphere of radius $\lambda$ centered at $x$. We prove $ \ell ^{p}$ improving properties of $ A_{\lambda }$. \begin{equation*} \lVert A_{\lambda }\rVert_{\ell ^{p} \to \ell ^{p'}} \leq C_{d,p, \omega (\lambda ^2 )} \lambda ^{d ( 1-\frac{2}p)}, \qquad \tfrac{d-1}{d+1} < p \leq \frac{d} {d-2}. \end{equation*} It holds in dimension $ d =4$ for odd $ \lambda ^2 $. The dependence is in terms of $ \omega (\lambda ^2 )$, the number of distinct prime factors of $ \lambda ^2 $. These inequalities are discrete versions of a classical inequality of Littman and Strichartz on the $ L ^{p}$ improving property of spherical averages on $ \mathbb R ^{d}$, in particular they are scale free, in a natural sense. The proof uses the decomposition of the corresponding multiplier whose properties were established by Magyar-Stein-Wainger, and Magyar. We then use a proof strategy of Bourgain, which dominates each part of the decomposition by an endpoint estimate.",0
Influence of equilibrium thermal 1/f-type mobility fluctuations on time-of-flight measurements is considered. We show that it can explain experimental time dependencies of transient photocurrents.,0
"We study quantum coherence in a semiconductor charge qubit formed from a GaAs double quantum dot containing a single electron. Voltage pulses are applied to depletion gates to drive qubit rotations and non-invasive state readout is achieved using a quantum point contact charge detector. We measure a maximum coherence time of ~7 ns at the charge degeneracy point, where the qubit level splitting is first-order-insensitive to gate voltage fluctuations. We compare measurements of the coherence time as a function of detuning with predictions from a 1/f noise model.",0
"Quantum statistics originate from the physics of state preparation. It is therefore wrong to think of quantum states as fundamental. In fact, quantum states are merely summaries of dynamical processes that randomize the properties of the system by drawing on the inexhaustible reservoir of quantum fluctuations provided by the physical tools used to control the quantum system. The mathematical form of the """"state vector"""" is actually an expression of the laws of causality which describe the relations between physical properties in terms of the action of transformations. These laws of causality directly associate the macroscopic effects of a physical property in an interaction with the environment with dynamical changes to the system caused by the microscopic properties of that environment.",0
"Greene, Morrison and Plesser \cite{GMP} have recently suggested a general method for constructing a mirror map between a $d$-dimensional Calabi-Yau hypersurface and its mirror partner for $d > 3$. We apply their method to smooth hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces and compute the Chern numbers of holomorphic curves on these hypersurfaces. As anticipated, the results satisfy nontrivial integrality constraints. These examples differ from those studied previously in that standard methods of algebraic geometry which work in the ordinary projective space case for low degree curves are not generally applicable. In the limited special cases in which they do work we can get independent predictions, and we find agreement with our results.",0
We have performed analytically the transverse momentum integrations in the real corrections to the longitudinal \gamma^*_L impact factor and carried out numerically the remaining integrations. I outline the analytical integration and present the numerical results: we have performed a numerical test and computed those parts of the impact factor that depend upon the energy scale s_0.,0
"We construct an exactly soluble Hamiltonian on the D=3 cubic lattice, whose ground state is a topological phase of bosons protected by time reversal symmetry, i.e a symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase. In this model anyonic excitations are shown to exist at the surface but not in the bulk. The statistics of these surface anyons is explicitly computed and shown to be identical to the 3-fermion Z2 model, a variant of Z2 topological order which cannot be realized in a purely D=2 system with time reversal symmetry. Thus the model realizes a novel surface termination for SPT phases, which only becomes available in D=3: that of a fully symmetric gapped surface with topological order. The 3D phase found here is also outside the group cohomology classification that appears to capture all SPT phases in lower dimensions. It is identified with a phase previously predicted from a field theoretic analysis, whose surface is roughly `half' of a Kitaev E8 phase. Our construction utilizes the Walker-Wang prescription to create a 3D confined phase with surface anyons,which can be extended to other symmetry classes and topological orders.",0
"From reducing stress and loneliness, to boosting productivity and overall well-being, pets are believed to play a significant role in people's daily lives. Many traditional studies have identified that frequent interactions with pets could make individuals become healthier and more optimistic, and ultimately enjoy a happier life. However, most of those studies are not only restricted in scale, but also may carry biases by using subjective self-reports, interviews, and questionnaires as the major approaches. In this paper, we leverage large-scale data collected from social media and the state-of-the-art deep learning technologies to study this phenomenon in depth and breadth. Our study includes four major steps: 1) collecting timeline posts from around 20,000 Instagram users, 2) using face detection and recognition on 2-million photos to infer users' demographics, relationship status, and whether having children, 3) analyzing a user's degree of happiness based on images and captions via smiling classification and textual sentiment analysis, 3) applying transfer learning techniques to retrain the final layer of the Inception v3 model for pet classification, and 4) analyzing the effects of pets on happiness in terms of multiple factors of user demographics. Our main results have demonstrated the efficacy of our proposed method with many new insights. We believe this method is also applicable to other domains as a scalable, efficient, and effective methodology for modeling and analyzing social behaviors and psychological well-being. In addition, to facilitate the research involving human faces, we also release our dataset of 700K analyzed faces.",0
"We give a generalization of the notion of a Cartan-Ehresmann connection from Lie algebras to L-infinity algebras and use it to study the obstruction theory of lifts through higher String-like extensions of Lie algebras. We find (generalized) Chern-Simons and BF-theory functionals this way and describe aspects of their parallel transport and quantization. It is known that over a D-brane the Kalb-Ramond background field of the string restricts to a 2-bundle with connection (a gerbe) which can be seen as the obstruction to lifting the PU(H)-bundle on the D-brane to a U(H)-bundle. We discuss how this phenomenon generalizes from the ordinary central extension U(1) -> U(H) -> PU(H) to higher categorical central extensions, like the String-extension BU(1) -> String(G) -> G. Here the obstruction to the lift is a 3-bundle with connection (a 2-gerbe): the Chern-Simons 3-bundle classified by the first Pontrjagin class. For G = Spin(n) this obstructs the existence of a String-structure. We discuss how to describe this obstruction problem in terms of Lie n-algebras and their corresponding categorified Cartan-Ehresmann connections. Generalizations even beyond String-extensions are then straightforward. For G = Spin(n) the next step is """"Fivebrane structures"""" whose existence is obstructed by certain generalized Chern-Simons 7-bundles classified by the second Pontrjagin class.",0
"The theory of summability of divergent series is a major branch of mathematical analysis that has found important applications in engineering and science. It addresses methods of assigning natural values to divergent sums, whose prototypical examples include the Abel summation method, the Cesaro means, and Borel summability method. In this paper, we introduce a new summability method for divergent series, and derive an asymptotic expression to its error term. We show that it is both regular and linear, and that it arises quite naturally in the study of local polynomial approximations of analytic functions. Because the proposed summability method is conceptually simple and can be implemented in a few lines of code, it can be quite useful in practice for computing the values of divergent sums.",0
"We investigate how the dynamical production of quantum entanglement for weakly coupled, composite quantum systems is influenced by the chaotic dynamics of the corresponding classical system, using coupled kicked tops. The linear entropy for the subsystem (a kicked top) is employed as a measure of entanglement. A perturbative formula for the entanglement production rate is derived. The formula contains a correlation function that can be evaluated only from the information of uncoupled tops. Using this expression and the assumption that the correlation function decays exponentially which is plausible for chaotic tops, it is shown that {\it the increment of the strength of chaos does not enhance the production rate of entanglement} when the coupling is weak enough and the subsystems (kicked tops) are strongly chaotic. The result is confirmed by numerical experiments. The perturbative approach is also applied to a weakly chaotic region, where tori and chaotic sea coexist in the corresponding classical phase space, to reexamine a recent numerical study that suggests an intimate relationship between the linear stability of the corresponding classical trajectory and the entanglement production rate.",0
"The recent discovery of isotopes with Z=110--111 suggests evidence for (1) a monopole--monopole interaction that does not appear explicitly in Nilsson--Strutinsky mass systematics, and (2) a competition between $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ dynamical symmetries that has been predicted for this region. Our calculations suggest that these new isotopes are near spherical, and may represent a true island of superheavy nuclei, but shifted downward in neutron number by these new physical effects.",0
"Firstly, we consider Yang-Mills theory on ${\mathbb R}^{3,1}$ with an adjoint Higgs field spontaneously breaking a compact gauge group $G$ to a subgroup $H$, so that the Higgs vacuum manifold forms the coset $G/H$. It is shown that in the low-energy limit, when the Higgs vacuum value is large, the 4d Yang-Mills-Higgs theory reduces to the Faddeev sigma model on ${\mathbb R}^{3,1}$ with $G/H$ as target. Its action contains the standard two-derivative sigma-model term as well as the four-derivative Skyrme-type term, which stabilizes solutions against scaling. Secondly, we put the Higgs field in the bi-fundamental representation of $G=\textrm{U}_+(N)\times\textrm{U}_-(N)$, realizing the simplest $A_2$-type quiver gauge theory. Breaking $G$ to $H{=}\,\textrm{diag}(G)$, the vacuum manifold $G/H\cong\textrm{U}(N)$ is a group. In this case, when the Higgs vacuum value is large, the 4d $A_2$-quiver gauge theory reduces to the Skyrme sigma model on ${\mathbb R}^{3,1}$ with U$(N)$ as target. Thus, both the Skyrme and the Faddeev model arise as effective field theories in the infrared of Yang-Mills-Higgs models.",0
"We provide a comprehensive microscopic understanding of the nucleation of topological quantum liquids, a general mechanism where interactions between non-Abelian anyons cause a transition to another topological phase, which we study in the context of Kitaev's honeycomb lattice model. For non-Abelian vortex excitations arranged on superlattices, we observe the nucleation of several distinct Abelian topological phases whose character is found to depend on microscopic parameters such as the superlattice spacing or the spin exchange couplings. By reformulating the interacting vortex superlattice in terms of an effective model of Majorana fermion zero modes, we show that the nature of the collective many-anyon state can be fully traced back to the microscopic pairwise vortex interactions. Due to RKKY-type sign oscillations in the interactions, we find that longer-range interactions beyond nearest neighbor can influence the collective state and thus need to be included for a comprehensive picture. The omnipresence of such interactions implies that corresponding results should hold for vortices forming an Abrikosov lattice in a p-wave superconductor, quasiholes forming a Wigner crystal in non-Abelian quantum Hall states or topological nanowires arranged in regular arrays.",0
For the lithium dimer we calculate cross sections for absorption of radiation from the vibrational-rotational levels of the ground X [singlet Sigma g +] electronic state to the vibrational levels and continua of the excited A [singlet Sigma u +] and B [singlet Pi u] electronic states. Theoretical and experimental data are used to characterize the molecular properties taking advantage of knowledge recently obtained from photoassociation spectroscopy and ultra-cold atom collision studies. The quantum-mechanical calculations are carried out for temperatures in the range from 1000 to 2000 K and are compared with previous calculations and measurements.,0
"In this article we present exact calculations that substantiate a clear picture relating the confining force of QCD to the zero-modes of the Faddeev-Popov (FP) operator $\mathcal{M}(A) = - \partial \cdot D(A)$. This is done in two steps. First we calculate the spectral decomposition of the FP operator and show that the ghost propagator $\mathcal{G}(k; A) = \langle \vec{k}| \mathcal{M}^{-1}(A) | \vec{k} \rangle$ in an external gauge potential $A$ is enhanced at low $k$ in Fourier space for configurations $A$ on the Gribov horizon. This results from the new formula in the low-$k$ regime $\mathcal{G}^{ab}(k,A) = \delta^{ab} \lambda_{|\vec{k}|}^{-1}(gA)$, where $\lambda_{|\vec{k}|}(gA)$ is the eigenvalue of the FP operator that emerges from $\lambda_{|\vec{k}|}(0) = \vec{k}^2$ at $A$ = 0. Next we derive a strict inequality signaling the divergence of the color-Coulomb potential at low momentum $k$ namely, $\widetilde{\mathcal{V}}(k) \geq k^2 G^2(k)$ for $k \to 0$, where $\widetilde{\mathcal{V}}(k)$ is the Fourier transform of the color-Coulomb potential $\mathcal{V}(r)$ and $G(k)$ is the ghost propagator in momentum space. The first result holds in the Landau and Coulomb gauges, whereas the second holds in the Coulomb gauge only. We propose a new numerical lattice gauge fixing that should be closer to the present analytic approach than other numerical gauges.",0
"Recommender systems are critical tools to match listings and travelers in two-sided vacation rental marketplaces. Such systems require high capacity to extract user preferences for items from implicit signals at scale. To learn those preferences, we propose a Simple Deep Personalized Recommendation System to compute travelers' conditional embeddings. Our method combines listing embeddings in a supervised structure to build short-term historical context to personalize recommendations for travelers. Deployed in the production environment, this approach is computationally efficient and scalable, and allows us to capture non-linear dependencies. Our offline evaluation indicates that traveler embeddings created using a Deep Average Network can improve the precision of a downstream conversion prediction model by seven percent, outperforming more complex benchmark methods for online shopping experience personalization.",0
"All eigenstates and eigenvalues are determined for the spin- 1/2 $XXZ$ chain $H = 2J \sum_i ( S_{i}^{x} S_{i + 1}^{x} + S_{i}^{y} S_{i + 1}^{y} + \Delta S_i^z S_{i + 1}^{z})$ for rings with up to N=16 spins, for anisotropies $\Delta=0 , \cos(0.3\pi)$, and 1. The dynamic spin pair correlations $< S_{l+n}^{\mu}(t) S_l^{\mu} > , (\mu=x,z)$, the dynamic structure factors $S^{\mu}(q,\omega)$, and the intermediate structure factors $I^{\mu}(q,t)$ are calculated for arbitrary temperature T. It is found, that for all T, $S^{z}(q,\omega)$ is mainly concentrated on the region $|\omega| < \varepsilon_2(q)$, where $\varepsilon_2(q)$ is the upper boundary of the two-spinon continuum, although excited states corresponding to a much broader frequency spectrum contribute. This is also true for the Haldane-Shastry model and the frustrated Heisenberg model. The intermediate structure factors $I^{\mu}(q,t)$ for $\Delta \neq 0$ show exponential decay for high T and large q. Within the accessible time range, the time-dependent spin correlation functions do not display the long-time signatures of spin diffusion.",0
"Dark matter trapped in the Sun produces a flux of all flavors of neutrinos, which then reach the Earth after propagating out of the Sun and oscillating from the production point to the detector. The typical signal which is looked at refers to the muon neutrino component and consists of a flux of up-going muons in a neutrino detector. We propose instead a novel signature: the possibility of looking at the tau neutrino component of the dark matter signal, which is almost background-free in the downward-going direction, since the tau neutrino amount in atmospheric neutrinos is negligible and in the down-going baseline atmospheric muon-neutrinos have no time to sizably oscillate. We analyze the prospects of studying the downward-going tau neutrinos from dark matter annihilation (or decay) in the Sun in Cherenkov detectors, by looking at hadronic showers produced in the charged-current tau neutrino interactions and subsequent tau decay. We discuss the various sources of background (namely the small tau neutrino component in atmospheric neutrinos, both from direct production and from oscillations; tau neutrinos from solar corona interactions; the galactic tau neutrino component) as well as sources of background due to misidentification of electron and muon events. We find that the downward-going tau neutrinos signal has potentially very good prospects for Mton scale Cherenkov detectors, the main limitation being the level of misidentification of non-tau events, which need to be kept at level of percent. Several tens of events per year (depending on the dark matter mass and annihilation/decay channel) are potentially collectible with a Mton scale detector, and a 5 sigma significance discovery is potentially reachable for dark matter masses in the range from 20 to 300 GeV with a few years of exposure on a Mton detector.",0
"Minor bodies of the solar system can be used to measure the spectrum of the Sun as a star by observing sunlight reflected by their surfaces. To perform an accurate measurement of the radial velocity of the Sun as a star by this method, it is necessary to take into account the Doppler shifts introduced by the motion of the reflecting body. Here we discuss the effect of its rotation. It gives a vanishing contribution only when the inclinations of the body rotation axis to the directions of the Sun and of the Earth observer are the same. When this is not the case, the perturbation of the radial velocity does not vanish and can reach up to about 2.4 m/s for an asteroid such as 2 Pallas that has an inclination of the spin axis to the plane of the ecliptic of about 30 degrees. We introduce a geometric model to compute the perturbation in the case of a uniformly reflecting body of spherical or triaxial ellipsoidal shape and provide general results to easily estimate the magnitude of the effect.",0
"Time-of-flight inelastic neutron scattering measurements on Sr2IrO4 single crystals were performed to access the spin Hamiltonian in this canonical Jeff=1/2 spin-orbital Mott insulator. The momentum of magnetic scattering at all inelastic energies that were measured is revealed to be $L$-independent, indicative of idealized two-dimensional in-plane correlations. By probing the in-plane energy and momentum dependence up to ~80 meV we model the magnetic excitations and define a spin-gap of 0.6(1) meV. Collectively the results indicate that despite the strong spin-orbit entangled isospins an isotropic two-dimensional S=1/2 Heisenberg model Hamiltonian accurately describes the magnetic interactions, pointing to a robust analogy with unconventional superconducting cuprates.",0
"A shift-invariant space is a space of functions that is invariant under integer translations. Such spaces are often used as models for spaces of signals and images in mathematical and engineering applications. This paper characterizes those shift-invariant subspaces S that are also invariant under additional (non-integer) translations. For the case of finitely generated spaces, these spaces are characterized in terms of the generators of the space. As a consequence, it is shown that principal shift-invariant spaces with a compactly supported generator cannot be invariant under any non-integer translations.",0
"New elliptic cylindrical wavelets are introduced, which exploit the relationship between analysing filters and Floquet's solution of Mathieu differential equations. It is shown that the transfer function of both multiresolution filters is related to the solution of a Mathieu equation of odd characteristic exponent. The number of notches of these analysing filters can be easily designed. Wavelets derived by this method have potential application in the fields of optics, microwaves and electromagnetism.",0
"Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) entails clinical evaluation of multiple cognition metrics and biomarkers. Metrics such as the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive test (ADAS-cog) comprise multiple subscores that quantify different aspects of a patient's cognitive state such as learning, memory, and language production/comprehension. Although computer-aided diagnostic techniques for classification of a patient's current disease state exist, they provide little insight into the relationship between changes in brain structure and different aspects of a patient's cognitive state that occur over time in AD. We have developed a Convolutional Neural Network architecture that can concurrently predict the trajectories of the 13 subscores comprised by a subject's ADAS-cog examination results from a current minimally preprocessed structural MRI scan up to 36 months from image acquisition time without resorting to manual feature extraction. Mean performance metrics are within range of those of existing techniques that require manual feature selection and are limited to predicting aggregate scores.",0
"We present a theoretical investigation of a lattice Tonks-gas that is created by inelastic, instead of elastic interactions. An analytical calculation shows that in the limit of strong two-body losses, the dynamics of the system is effectively that of a Tonks gas. We also derive an analytic expression for the effective loss rate. We find good agreement between these analytical results and results from a rigorous numerical calculation. The Tonks character of the gas is visible both in a reduced effective loss rate and in the momentum distribution of the gas.",0
"For $1$-dimensional Legendrian submanifolds of $1$-jet spaces, we extend the functorality of the Legendrian contact homology DG-algebra (DGA) from embedded exact Lagrangian cobordisms, as in \cite{EHK}, to a class of immersed exact Lagrangian cobordisms by considering their Legendrian lifts as conical Legendrian cobordisms. To a conical Legendrian cobordism $\Sigma$ from $\Lambda_-$ to $\Lambda_+$, we associate an immersed DGA map, which is a diagram $$\alg(\Lambda_+) \stackrel{f}{\rightarrow} \alg(\Sigma) \stackrel{i}{\hookleftarrow} \alg(\Lambda_-), $$ where $f$ is a DGA map and $i$ is an inclusion map. This construction gives a functor between suitably defined categories of Legendrians with immersed Lagrangian cobordisms and DGAs with immersed DGA maps. In an algebraic preliminary, we consider an analog of the mapping cylinder construction in the setting of DG-algebras and establish several of its properties. As an application we give examples of augmentations of Legendrian twist knots that can be induced by an immersed filling with a single double point but cannot be induced by any orientable embedded filling.",0
"This project proposes to reuse the DAFNE accelerator complex for producing a high intensity (up to 10^10), high-quality beam of high-energy (up to 500 MeV) positrons for HEP experiments, mainly - but not only - motivated by light dark particles searches. Such a facility would provide a unique source of ultra-relativistic, narrow-band and low-emittance positrons, with a high duty factor, without employing a cold technology, that would be an ideal facility for exploring the existence of light dark matter particles, produced in positron-on-target annihilations into a photon+missing mass, and using the bump-hunt technique. The PADME experiment, that will use the extracted beam from the DAFNE BTF, is indeed limited by the low duty-factor (10^-5=200 ns/20 ms). The idea is to use a variant of the third of integer resonant extraction, with the aim of getting a <10^-6 m rad emittance and, at the same time, tailoring the scheme to the peculiar optics of the DAFNE machine. In alternative, the possibility of kicking the positrons by means of channelling effects in crystals can be evaluated. This would not only increase the extraction efficiency but also improve the beam quality, thanks to the high collimation of channelled particles.",0
"We study canonical quantization of a closed Euclidean universe with a cosmological constant and a massless scalar field. The closed Euclidean universe with an ordinary matter state can be matched at a finite radius only with the closed Lorentzian universe with the Wick-rotated exotic state. The exotic state provides the Lorentzian universe with a potential barrier extending from the cosmological singularity to the classical turning point and corresponding to the Euclidean geometry through the Wick-rotation, and avoid the singularity problem at the matching boundary. We find analytically the approximate wave functions for quantum creation of the Universe from the {\it nothingness}. We prescribe the Hartle-Hawking's no-boundary wave function, Linde's wave function and Vilenkin's tunneling wave function. In particular, we find the wave function for the Euclidean geometry, whose semiclassical solution is regular at the matching boundary with the Lorentzian geometry but singular at the cosmological singularity.",0
"We employ gravitational-wave radiometry to map the gravitational waves stochastic background expected from a variety of contributing mechanisms and test the assumption of isotropy using data from Advanced LIGO's first observing run. We also search for persistent gravitational waves from point sources with only minimal assumptions over the 20 - 1726 Hz frequency band. Finding no evidence of gravitational waves from either point sources or a stochastic background, we set limits at 90% confidence. For broadband point sources, we report upper limits on the gravitational wave energy flux per unit frequency in the range $F_{\alpha,\Theta}(f) < (0.1 - 56) \times 10^{-8}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ (f/25 Hz)$^{\alpha-1}$ depending on the sky location $\Theta$ and the spectral power index $\alpha$. For extended sources, we report upper limits on the fractional gravitational wave energy density required to close the Universe of $\Omega(f,\Theta) < (0.39-7.6) \times 10^{-8}$ sr$^{-1}$ (f/25 Hz)$^\alpha$ depending on $\Theta$ and $\alpha$. Directed searches for narrowband gravitational waves from astrophysically interesting objects (Scorpius X-1, Supernova 1987 A, and the Galactic Center) yield median frequency-dependent limits on strain amplitude of $h_0 <$ (6.7, 5.5, and 7.0) $\times 10^{-25}$ respectively, at the most sensitive detector frequencies between 130 - 175 Hz. This represents a mean improvement of a factor of 2 across the band compared to previous searches of this kind for these sky locations, considering the different quantities of strain constrained in each case.",0
"Crystalline plasticity is strongly interlinked with dislocation mechanics and nowadays is relatively well understood. Concepts and physical models of plastic deformation in amorphous materials on the other hand - where the concept of linear lattice defects is not applicable - still are lagging behind. We introduce an eigenstrain-based finite element lattice model for simulations of shear band formation and strain avalanches. Our model allows us to study the influence of surfaces and finite size effects on the statistics of avalanches. We find that even with relatively complex loading conditions and open boundary conditions, critical exponents describing avalanche statistics are unchanged, which validates the use of simpler scalar lattice-based models to study these phenomena.",0
"In the online Steiner tree problem, a sequence of points is revealed one-by-one: when a point arrives, we only have time to add a single edge connecting this point to the previous ones, and we want to minimize the total length of edges added. For two decades, we know that the greedy algorithm maintains a tree whose cost is O(log n) times the Steiner tree cost, and this is best possible. But suppose, in addition to the new edge we add, we can change a single edge from the previous set of edges: can we do much better? Can we maintain a tree that is constant-competitive? We answer this question in the affirmative. We give a primal-dual algorithm, and a novel dual-based analysis, that makes only a single swap per step (in addition to adding the edge connecting the new point to the previous ones), and such that the tree's cost is only a constant times the optimal cost. Previous results for this problem gave an algorithm that performed an amortized constant number of swaps: for each n, the number of swaps in the first n steps was O(n). We also give a simpler tight analysis for this amortized case.",0
"We explore the effects of UV absorbing material on the shape of the EUV continuum radiation emitted by the active galactic nucleus, and on the relative strengths of emission lines, formed in the narrow line regions of Seyfert galaxies, excited by this continuum. Within a sample of Seyfert 1.5 galaxies, objects with flatter soft X-ray slopes tend to have lower values of He II 4686/H-beta, which implies a correlation between the observed spectral energy distribution of the ionizing continuum and the narrow emission line strengths. Objects with the flattest soft X-ray continua tend to possess high column density UV absorption and it is plausible that the differences in narrow emission line ratios among these galaxies are an indication of the effects of absorbing material internal to the narrow line region, rather than intrinsic differences in continuum shape. We have generated a set of photoionization models to examine the effect of a range of UV absorbers on the ionizing continuum and, hence, the resulting conditions in a typical narrow line cloud. Our results indicate that a low ionization UV absorber with large covering factor will indeed produce the combination of narrow line ratios and soft X-ray spectral characteristics observed in several Seyfert 1.5 galaxies. Our results also suggest that low ionization UV absorption may be more common than currently believed.",0
"A discrete-time intersymbol interference channel with additive Gaussian noise is considered, where only the receiver has knowledge of the channel impulse response. An approach for combining decision-feedback equalization with channel coding is proposed, where decoding precedes the removal of intersymbol interference. This is accomplished by combining the recently proposed integer-forcing equalization approach with cyclic block codes. The channel impulse response is linearly equalized to an integer-valued response. This is then utilized by leveraging the property that a cyclic code is closed under (cyclic) integer-valued convolution. Explicit bounds on the performance of the proposed scheme are also derived.",0
"The cosmic-ray positron flux calculated using the cosmic-ray nuclei interactions in our Galaxy cannot explain observed data above 10 GeV. An excess in the measured positron flux is therefore open to interpretation. Nearby pulsars, located within sub-kiloparsec range of the Solar system, are often invoked as plausible sources contributing to the excess. We show that an additional, sub-dominant population of sources together with the contributions from a few nearby pulsars can explain the latest positron excess data from the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS). We simultaneously model, using the DRAGON code, propagation of cosmic-ray proton, Helium, electron and positron and fit their respective flux data. Our fit to the Boron to Carbon ratio data gives a diffusion spectral index of 0.45, which is close to the Kraichnan turbulent spectrum.",0
"An unconstrained nonlinear binary optimization problem of selecting a maximum expected value subset of items is considered. Each item is associated with a profit and probability. Each of the items succeeds or fails independently with the given probabilities, and the profit is obtained in the event that all selected items succeed. The objective is to select a subset that maximizes the total value times the product of probabilities of the chosen items. The problem is proven NP-hard by a nontrivial reduction from subset sum. Then we develop a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for this problem.",0
"We report the results from a 17O Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) study of the high temperature superconducting cuprate (HTSC), RuSr2EuCu2O8. This compound has recently been found to exhibit the coexistence of magnetic order and superconductivity. At 9 T, the magnetic order in the RuO2 layers is predominately ferromagnetic. We measured the 17O NMR spectra from 10 K to 330 K and find the occurrence of an increasing 17O NMR shift with increasing temperature for temperatures above ~200 K, providing direct evidence that RuSr2RCu2O8 is similar to a very underdoped HTSC. The analysis of the NMR shift and spectral width of the 17O NMR line gives a small but measurable hyperfine field of ~9 mT from the Ru moment at the oxygen site in the copper oxygen planes. We show that the 17O NMR linewidth is governed by dipolar contributions from the Ru moment.",0
"We present the angular distribution of the rare B decay, $B \to K^* (\to K \pi) \ell^+ \ell^-$. By studying the azimuthal angle distribution in the low invariant mass region of dileptons, we can probe new physics effects efficiently. In particular, this distribution is found to be quite sensitive to the ratio of the contributions from two independent magnetic moment operators, which also contribute to $B \to K^* \gamma$. Therefore, our method can be very useful when new physics is introduced without changing the total decay rate of the $b \to s \gamma$. The angular distributions are compared with the predictions of the standard model, and are shown for the cases when the afore-mentioned ratio is different from the standard model prediction.",0
"We study the diffusion process in binary mixtures using transition probabilities that depend on a mean-field potential. This approach reproduces the Darken equation, a relationship between the intrinsic and the tracer diffusion coefficients, $D_A$ and $D_A^*$, through the thermodynamic factor $\Phi$ (a function of the derivative of the activity coefficient against molar fraction). The mean-field approach allows us to go beyond the Darken equation and separately specify the dependence of $D_A$ and $D_A^*$ on the thermodynamic factor. We obtain that $\Phi$ appears in the expression for $D_A^*$, but the intrinsic diffusivity $D_A$ turns out to be independent of $\Phi$. Experimental results taken from the literature on diffusion in metal alloys are consistent with this theoretical prediction.",0
"It is shown that the existence of static, cylindrically symmetric wormholes does not require violation of the weak or null energy conditions near the throat, and cylindrically symmetric wormhole geometries can appear with less exotic sources than wormholes whose throats have a spherical topology. Examples of exact wormhole solutions are given with scalar, spinor and electromagnetic fields as sources, and these fields are not necessarily phantom. In particular, there are wormhole solutions for a massless, minimally coupled scalar field in the presence of a negative cosmological constant, and for an azimuthal Maxwell electromagnetic field. All these solutions are not asymptotically flat. A no-go theorem is proved, according to which a flat (or string) asymptotic behavior on both sides of a cylindrical wormhole throat is impossible if the energy density of matter is everywhere nonnegative.",0
"Let R be a sufficiently saturated o-minimal expansion of a real closed field, let O be the convex hull of the rationals in R, and let st: O^n \to \mathbb{R}^n be the standard part map. For X \subseteq R^n define st(X):=st(X \cap O^n). We let \mathbb{R}_{\ind} be the structure with underlying set \mathbb{R} and expanded by all sets of the form st(X), where X \subseteq R^{n} is definable in R and n=1,2,.... We show that the subsets of \mathbb{R}^n that are definable in \mathbb{R}_{\ind} are exactly the finite unions of sets of the form st(X) \setminus st(Y), where X,Y \subseteq R^n are definable in R. A consequence of the proof is a partial answer to a question by Hrushovski, Peterzil and Pillay about the existence of measures with certain invariance properties on the lattice of bounded definable sets in R^n.",0
"This work concerns the moment map $\mu$ associated with the standard representation of a classical Lie algebra. For applications to deformation quantization it is desirable that $S/(\mu)$, the coordinate algebra of the zero fibre of $\mu$, be Koszul. The main result is that this algebra is not Koszul for the standard representation of $\mathfrak{sl}_{n}$, and of $\mathfrak{sp}_{n}$. This is deduced from a computation of the Betti numbers of $S/(\mu)$ as an $S$-module, which are of interest also from the point of view of commutative algebra.",0
"We report a new Lobachevsky University database (LUDB) of ECG signals that contains 200 samples of 10-second 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) from different subjects. The boundaries of the ECG signal complexes are manually annotated by cardiologists for all samples and independently for each lead. The database is representative of a variety of signal morphologies. In addition, all records have an attributed diagnosis. These features make LUDB a promising tool for validating ECG delineation algorithms across a broad range of ECG signal shapes and patient diagnoses. A case study for the recently proposed wavelet-based algorithm is presented.",0
"We propose a general statistical framework for clustering multiple time series that exhibit nonlinear dynamics into an a-priori-unknown number of sub-groups. Our motivation comes from neuroscience, where an important problem is to identify, within a large assembly of neurons, subsets that respond similarly to a stimulus or contingency. Upon modeling the multiple time series as the output of a Dirichlet process mixture of nonlinear state-space models, we derive a Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm for full Bayesian inference that alternates between sampling cluster assignments and sampling parameter values that form the basis of the clustering. The Metropolis step employs recent innovations in particle-based methods. We apply the framework to clustering time series acquired from the prefrontal cortex of mice in an experiment designed to characterize the neural underpinnings of fear.",0
"We show that the weakly dissipative Camassa-Holm, Degasperis-Procesi, Hunter-Saxton, and Novikov equations can be reduced to their non-dissipative versions by means of an exponentially time-dependent scaling. Hence, up to a simple change of variables, the non-dissipative and dissipative versions of these equations are equivalent. Similar results hold also for the equations in the so-called b-family of equations as well as for the two-component and \mu-versions of the above equations.",0
"Recently, for a family of ungraded Dirac operators over some space $B$ J. Lott constructed an index gerbe. In the present paper we show (in analogy to the holonomy formula for the determinant bundle in the graded case) that the holonomy of the index gerbe (a priori a hermitean line bundle with connection over the free loop space $LB$) coincides with an adiabatic limit of determinant bundles of an associated family of graded Dirac operators over $LB$.",0
"We argue that a certain type of many minds (and many worlds) interpretations of quantum mechanics due to Lockwood (and Deutsch) do not provide a coherent interpretation of the quantum mechanical probabilistic algorithm. By contrast, in Albert and Loewer's version of the many minds interpretation there is a coherent interpretation of the quantum mechanical probabilities. We consider Albert and Loewer's probability interpretation in the context of Bell-type and GHZ-type states and argue that it exhibits a certain form of nonlocality which is, however, much weaker than Bell's nonlocality.",0

"The equilibrium equations for wide, developable, Moebius strips undergoing large deformations have recently been derived, and solved, numerically. We use these results to compute the eigenvalues and eigenstates of non-interacting electrons confined to Moebius strips of linking number up to 1.5 and of arbitrary width. The inverse participation ratio is used to show that electrons are increasingly localised to the higher curvature regions of the higher-width structures, where sharp creases could form channels for particle transport. Our geometric formulation could be used to study transport properties of Moebius strip and other components in nanoscale devices.",0
"Calcification and mineralization are fundamental physiological processes, yet the mechanisms of calcification, in trabecular bone and in calcified lesions in atherosclerotic calcification, are unclear. Recently, it was shown in in vitro experiments that vascular-derived mesenchymal stem cells can display self-organized calcified patterns. These patterns were attributed to activator/inhibitor dynamics in the style of Turing, with bone morphogenetic protein 2 acting as an activator, and matrix GLA protein acting as an inhibitor. Motivated by this qualitative activator-inhibitor dynamics, we employ a prototype Gierer-Meinhardt model used in the context of activator-inhibitor based biological pattern formation. Through a detailed analysis in one and two spatial dimensions, we explore the pattern formation mechanisms of steady state patterns, including their dependence on initial conditions. These patterns range from localized holes to labyrinths and localized peaks, or in other words, from dense to sparse activator distributions (respectively). We believe that an understanding of the wide spectrum of activator-inhibitor patterns discussed here is prerequisite to their biochemical control. The mechanisms of pattern formation suggest therapeutic strategies applicable to bone formation in atherosclerotic lesions in arteries (where it is pathological) and to the regeneration of trabecular bone (recapitulating normal physiological development).",0
We prove some probabilistic estimates for tensor products of random vectors. As an application we obtain embeddings of certain matrix spaces into $L_1$.,0
The paper addresses a problem of change identification in social group evolution. A new SGCI method for discovering of stable groups was proposed and compared with existing GED method. The experimental studies on a Polish blogosphere service revealed that both methods are able to identify similar evolution events even though both use different concepts. Some differences were demonstrated as well,0
"Highly spinning Kerr black holes with masses $M = 1 - 100\ M_{\odot}$ are subject to an efficient superradiant instability in the presence of bosons with masses $\mu \sim 10^{-10} - 10^{-12}\ {\rm eV}$. We observe that this matches the effective plasma-induced photon mass in diffuse galactic or intracluster environments ($\omega_{\rm pl} \sim 10^{-10} - 10^{-12}\ {\rm eV}$). This suggests that bare Kerr black holes within galactic or intracluster environments, possibly even including the ones produced in recently observed gravitational wave events, are unstable to formation of a photon cloud that may contain a significant fraction of the mass of the original black hole. At maximal efficiency, the instability timescale for a massive vector is milliseconds, potentially leading to a transient rate of energy extraction from a black hole in principle as large as $\sim 10^{55} \ {\rm erg \, s}^{-1}$. We discuss possible astrophysical effects this could give rise to, including a speculative connection to Fast Radio Bursts.",0
"The maximum integer skew-symmetric flow problem (MSFP) generalizes both the maximum flow and maximum matching problems. It was introduced by Tutte in terms of self-conjugate flows in antisymmetrical digraphs. He showed that for these objects there are natural analogs of classical theoretical results on usual network flows, such as the flow decomposition, augmenting path, and max-flow min-cut theorems. We give unified and shorter proofs for those theoretical results. We then extend to MSFP the shortest augmenting path method of Edmonds and Karp and the blocking flow method of Dinits, obtaining algorithms with similar time bounds in general case. Moreover, in the cases of unit arc capacities and unit ``node capacities'' the blocking skew-symmetric flow algorithm has time bounds similar to those established in Even and Tarjan (1975) and Karzanov (1973) for Dinits' algorithm. In particular, this implies an algorithm for finding a maximum matching in a nonbipartite graph in $O(\sqrt{n}m)$ time, which matches the time bound for the algorithm of Micali and Vazirani. Finally, extending a clique compression technique of Feder and Motwani to particular skew-symmetric graphs, we speed up the implied maximum matching algorithm to run in $O(\sqrt{n}m\log(n^2/m)/\log{n})$ time, improving the best known bound for dense nonbipartite graphs. Also other theoretical and algorithmic results on skew-symmetric flows and their applications are presented.",0
"In this paper, we investigate a numerical approximation of a general second order semilinear parabolic non-autonomous stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) driven by additive noise. Numerical approximations for autonomous SPDEs are thoroughly investigated in the literature while the non-autonomous case is not yet well understood. We discretize the non-autonomous SPDE in space by the finite element method and in time by the Magnus-type integrator. We provide a strong convergence proof of the fully discrete scheme toward the mild solution in the root-mean-square $L^2$ norm. Appropriate assumptions on the drift term and the noise allow to achieve optimal convergence order in time greater than $1/2$, without any logarithmic reduction of convergence order in time. In particular, for trace class noise, we achieve optimal convergence orders $\mathcal{O}\left(h^{2-\epsilon}+\Delta t\right)$, where $\epsilon$ is a positive number small enough. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate our theoretical results.",0
"Building on the successful experience in operating the DarkSide-50 detector, the DarkSide Collaboration is going to construct DarkSide-20k, a direct WIMP search detector using a two-phase Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) with an active (fiducial) mass of 23 t (20 t). The DarkSide-20k LArTPC will be deployed within a shield/veto with a spherical Liquid Scintillator Veto (LSV) inside a cylindrical Water Cherenkov Veto (WCV). Operation of DarkSide-50 demonstrated a major reduction in the dominant $^{39}$Ar background when using argon extracted from an underground source, before applying pulse shape analysis. Data from DarkSide-50, in combination with MC simulation and analytical modeling, shows that a rejection factor for discrimination between electron and nuclear recoils of $\gt3\times10^9$ is achievable. This, along with the use of the veto system, is the key to unlocking the path to large LArTPC detector masses, while maintaining an """"instrumental background-free"""" experiment, an experiment in which less than 0.1 events (other than $\nu$-induced nuclear recoils) is expected to occur within the WIMP search region during the planned exposure. DarkSide-20k will have ultra-low backgrounds than can be measured in situ. This will give sensitivity to WIMP-nucleon cross sections of $1.2\times10^{-47}$ cm$^2$ ($1.1\times10^{-46}$ cm$^2$) for WIMPs of $1$ TeV$/c^2$ ($10$ TeV$/c^2$) mass, to be achieved during a 5 yr run producing an exposure of 100 t yr free from any instrumental background. DarkSide-20k could then extend its operation to a decade, increasing the exposure to 200 t yr, reaching a sensitivity of $7.4\times10^{-48}$ cm$^2$ ($6.9\times10^{-47}$ cm$^2$) for WIMPs of $1$ TeV$/c^2$ ($10$ TeV$/c^2$) mass.",0
"We resolve 182 individual giant molecular clouds (GMCs) larger than 2.5 $\times$ 10$^{5}$ \Msun in the inner disks of five large nearby spiral galaxies (NGC 2403, NGC 3031, NGC 4736, NGC 4826, and NGC 6946) to create the largest such sample of extragalactic GMCs within galaxies analogous to the Milky Way. Using a conservatively chosen sample of GMCs most likely to adhere to the virial assumption, we measure cloud sizes, velocity dispersions, and $^{12}$CO (J=1-0) luminosities and calculate cloud virial masses. The average conversion factor from CO flux to H$_{2}$ mass (or \xcons) for each galaxy is 1-2 \xcounits, all within a factor of two of the Milky Way disk value ($\sim$2 \xcounits). We find GMCs to be generally consistent within our errors between the galaxies and with Milky Way disk GMCs; the intrinsic scatter between clouds is of order a factor of two. Consistent with previous studies in the Local Group, we find a linear relationship between cloud virial mass and CO luminosity, supporting the assumption that the clouds in this GMC sample are gravitationally bound. We do not detect a significant population of GMCs with elevated velocity dispersions for their sizes, as has been detected in the Galactic center. Though the range of metallicities probed in this study is narrow, the average conversion factors of these galaxies will serve to anchor the high metallicity end of metallicity-\xco trends measured using conversion factors in resolved clouds; this has been previously possible primarily with Milky Way measurements.",0
"Software and hardware architectures are prone to modifications. We demonstrate how a mathematically founded powerful refinement calculus for a class of architectures, namely pipe and filter architectures, can be used to modify a system in a provably correct way. The calculus consists of basic rules to add and to remove filters (components) and pipes (channels) to a system. A networking example demonstrates some of the features of our calculus. The calculus is simple, flexible and compositional. Thus it allows us to build more complex and specific rules that e.g. embed models of existing architectures or define design patterns as transformation rules.",0
"We study the emergence of pattern formation and chaotic dynamics in the one-dimensional (1D) generalized Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (gKS) equation by means of a time-series analysis, in particular a nonlinear forecasting method which is based on concepts from chaos theory and appropriate statistical methods. We analyze two types of temporal signals, a local one and a global one, finding in both cases that the dynamical state of the gKS solution undergoes a transition from high-dimensional chaos to periodic pulsed oscillations through low-dimensional deterministic chaos with increasing the control parameter of the system. Our results demonstrate that the proposed nonlinear forecasting methodology allows to elucidate the dynamics of the system in terms of its predictability properties.",0
"We study theoretically the topological quantum phase transition in Cavity QED lattice. We predict the condition for non-topological phase to the topological phase transition conditions for three different model Hamiltonians in cavity QED lattice. We study these topological quantum phase transition through winding number, which is a topological invariant quantity. We argue that the appearance of topological phase in these systems where the discrete Z 2 symmetry broken. We show that the non-topological state is the vacuum state of the system where each cavity contains fermionic type excitations from light-matter interaction whereas the topological state of system contains Majorana modes of excitations at the end cavity of the lattice.",0
"In this article, we construct a supersymmetric real mass deformation for the adjoint chiral multiplets in the gauge theory describing the dynamics of a stack of D2-branes in type II string theory. We do so by placing the D2-branes into the T-dual of a supersymmetric NS fluxbrane background. We furthermore note that this background is the string theoretic realization of an Omega-deformation of flat space in the directions transverse to the branes where the deformation parameters satisfy \epsilon_1 = - \epsilon_2. This \Omega-deformation therefore serves to give supersymmetric real masses to the chiral multiplets of the 3D gauge theory. To illustrate the physical effect of the real mass term, we derive BPS-saturated classical solutions for the branes rotating in this background. Finally, we reproduce all the same structure in the presence of NS fivebranes and comment on the relationship to the gauge theory/spin-chain correspondence of Nekrasov and Shatashvili.",0
"We describe an algorithm for distinguishing hyperbolic components in the parameter space of quadratic rational maps with a periodic critical point. We then illustrate computer images of the hyperbolic components of the parameter spaces V1 - V4, which were produced using our algorithm. We also resolve the singularities of the projective closure of V5 by blowups, giving an alternative proof that as an algebraic curve, the geometric genus of V5 is 1. This explains why we are unable to produce an image for V5.",0
Limits on $\beta^+$EC and ECEC processes in $^{112}$Sn and on $\beta^-\beta^-$ decay of $^{124}$Sn to the excited states of $^{124}$Te have been obtained using a 380 cm$^3$ HPGe detector and an external source consisting of natural tin. A limit with 90% C.L. on the $^{112}$Sn half-life of $0.92\times 10^{20}$ y for the ECEC(0$\nu$) transition to the $0^+_3$ excited state in $^{112}$Cd (1871.0 keV) has been established. This transition is discussed in the context of a possible enhancement of the decay rate by several orders of magnitude given that the ECEC$(0\nu)$ process is nearly degenerate with an excited state in the daughter nuclide. Prospects for investigating such a process in future experiments are discussed. The $\beta^-\beta^-$ decay limits for $^{124}$Sn to the excited states of $^{124}$Te were obtained on the level of $(0.8-1.2)\times 10^{21}$ y at the 90% C.L.,0
"We show that a smooth projective complex manifold of dimension greater than two endowed with an elliptic fiber space structure and with finite fundamental group always contains a rational curve, provided its canonical bundle is relatively trivial. As an application of this result, we prove that any Calabi-Yau manifold that admits a fibration onto a curve whose general fibers are abelian varieties always contains a rational curve.",0
"We present new Fokker-Planck models of the evolution of globular clusters, including gravitational tidal shocks. We extend our calculations beyond the core collapse by adopting three-body binary heating. Effects of the shocks are included by adding the tidal shock diffusion coefficients to the ordinary Fokker-Planck equation: the first order heating term, <dE>, and the second order energy dispersion term, <dE^2>. As an example, we investigate the evolution of models for the globular cluster NGC 6254. Using the Hipparcos proper motions, we are now able to construct orbits of this cluster in the Galaxy. Tidal shocks accelerate significantly both core collapse and the evaporation of the cluster and shorten the destruction time from 24 Gyr to 18 Gyr. We examine various types of adiabatic corrections and find that they are critical for accurate calculation of the evolution. Without adiabatic corrections, the destruction time of the cluster is twice as short. We examine cluster evolution for a wide range of the concentration and tidal shock parameters, and determine the region of the parameter space where tidal shocks dominate the evolution. We present fitting formulae for the core collapse time and the destruction time, covering all reasonable initial conditions. In the limit of strong shocks, the typical value of the core collapse time decreases from 10 t_{rh} to 3 t_{rh} or less, while the destruction time is just twice that number. The effects of tidal shocks are rapidly self-limiting: as clusters lose mass and become more compact, the importance of the shocks diminishes. This implies that tidal shocks were more important in the past.",0
"The breaking of SO(10) to SU(3)_C x U(1)_EM can be accomplished by just four Higgs fields: the symmetric rank-two tensor, S(54); a pair of spinors, C(16) and Cbar(16bar); and a vector, T(10). This setup is also able to generate realistic fermion masses. The heavy color triplets in the vector and spinor fields mediate proton decay via dimension-five operators. The experimental bounds on proton decay constrain the structure and size of the Yukawa operators.",0
"The scattering equations on the Riemann sphere give rise to remarkable formulae for tree-level gauge theory and gravity amplitudes. Adamo, Casali and Skinner conjectured a one-loop formula for supergravity amplitudes based on scattering equations on a torus. We use a residue theorem to transform this into a formula on the Riemann sphere. What emerges is a framework for loop integrands on the Riemann sphere that promises to have wide application, based on off-shell scattering equations that depend on the loop momentum. We present new formulae, checked explicitly at low points, for supergravity and super-Yang-Mills amplitudes and for n-gon integrands at one loop. Finally, we show that the off-shell scattering equations naturally extend to arbitrary loop order, and we give a proposal for the all-loop integrands for supergravity and planar super-Yang-Mills theory.",0
"This paper proposes a class of $M$-channel spectral graph filter banks with a symmetric structure, that is, the transform has sampling operations and spectral graph filters on both the analysis and synthesis sides. The filter banks achieve maximum decimation, perfect recovery, and orthogonality. Conventional spectral graph transforms with decimation have significant limitations with regard to the number of channels, the structures of the underlying graph, and their filter design. The proposed transform uses sampling in the graph frequency domain. This enables us to use any variation operators and apply the transforms to arbitrary graphs even when the filter banks have symmetric structures. We clarify the perfect reconstruction conditions and show design examples. An experiment on graph signal denoising conducted to examine the performance of the proposed filter bank is described.",0
"We enhance the tribracket counting invariant with \textit{tribracket brackets}, skein invariants of tribracket-colored oriented knots and links analogously to biquandle brackets. This infinite family of invariants includes the classical quantum invariants and tribracket cocycle invariants as special cases, as well as new invariants. We provide explicit examples as well as questions for future work.",0
"We study the performance of the euro/Swiss franc exchange rate in the extraordinary period from September 6, 2011 and January 15, 2015 when the Swiss National Bank enforced a minimum exchange rate of 1.20 Swiss francs per euro. Based on the analogy between Brownian motion in finance and physics, the first-order effect of such a steric constraint would enter a priori in the form of a repulsive entropic force associated with the paths crossing the barrier that are forbidden. Non-parametric empirical estimates of drift and volatility show that the predicted first-order analogy between economics and physics are incorrect. The clue is to realise that the random walk nature of financial prices results from the continuous anticipations of traders about future opportunities, whose aggregate actions translate into an approximate efficient market with almost no arbitrage opportunities. With the Swiss National Bank stated commitment to enforce the barrier, traders's anticipation of this action leads to a vanishing drift together with a volatility of the exchange rate that depends on the distance to the barrier. We give direct quantitative empirical evidence that this effect is well described by Krugman's target zone model [P.R. Krugman. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 106(3):669-682, 1991]. Motivated by the insights from this economical model, we revise the initial economics-physics analogy and show that, within the context of hindered diffusion, the two systems can be described with the same mathematics after all. Using a recently proposed extended analogy in terms of a colloidal Brownian particle embedded in a fluid of molecules associated with the underlying order book, we derive that, close to the restricting boundary, the dynamics of both systems is described by a stochastic differential equation with a very small constant drift and a linear diffusion coefficient.",0
"In present work, we shall develope a protocol to estimate the average fidelity for the bipartite system. We show that the average fidelity should be known if the three measurable quantities, the average survive probability of the product state and the the average survive probablity of each subsystem, have been decided. Our protocol can be also applied to decide the selected element of the quantum proess matrix.",0
An experiment for the advanced undergraduate laboratory allowing students to directly observe the effect of photon polarisation on Compton scattering is described. An initially unpolarised beam of photons is polarised via Compton scattering and analysed through a subsequent scattering. The experiment is designed to use equipment typically available at an undergraduate physics laboratory. The experimental results are compared with a Geant4 simulation and geometry effects are discussed.,0
"We proposed, in our previous paper, to characterize the Hirota-Miwa equation by means of the theory of triangulated category. We extend our argument in this paper to support the idea. In particular we show in detail how the singularity confinement, a phenomenon which was proposed to characterize integrable maps, can be associated with the projective resolution of the triangulated category.",0
"When deploying a testbed infrastructure for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), one of the most challenging feature is to provide repeatable mobility. Wheeled robots, usually employed for such tasks, strive to adapt to the wide range of environments where WSNs are deployed, from chaotic office spaces to potato fields in the farmland. For this reson, these robot systems often require expensive customization steps that, for example, adapt their localization and navigation system. To avoid these issues, in this paper we present the design of Gondola, a parametric robot infrastructure based on pulling wires, rather than wheels, that avoids the most common problems of wheeled robot and easily adapts to many WSN's scenarios. Different from wheeled robots, wich movements are constrained on a 2-dimensional plane, Gondola can easily move in 3-dimensional spaces with no need of a complex localization system and an accuracy that is comparable with off-the-shelf wheeled robots.",0
"Report II is concerned with the extended results of distance function wavelets (DFW). The fractional DFW transforms are first addressed relating to the fractal geometry and fractional derivative, and then, the discrete Helmholtz-Fourier transform is briefly presented. The Green second identity may be an alternative devise in developing the theoretical framework of the DFW transform and series. The kernel solutions of the Winkler plate equation and the Burger's equation are used to create the DFW transforms and series. Most interestingly, it is found that the translation invariant monomial solutions of the high-order Laplace equations can be used to make very simple harmonic polynomial DFW series. In most cases of this study, solid mathematical analysis is missing and results are obtained intuitively in the conjecture status.",0
We perform fully relativistic calculations of binary neutron stars in quasi-equilibrium circular orbits. We integrate Einstein's equations together with the relativistic equation of hydrostatic equilibrium to solve the initial value problem for equal-mass binaries of arbitrary separation. We construct sequences of constant rest mass and identify the innermost stable circular orbit and its angular velocity. We find that the quasi-equilibrium maximum allowed mass of a neutron star in a close binary is slightly larger than in isolation.,0
"We derive an asymptotically accurate formula for the beam waist of ultrashort, tightly-focused fundamental linearly-polarized, radially-polarized, and azimuthally-polarized modes in free space. We compute the exact beam waist via numerical cubature to ascertain the accuracy with which our formula approximates the exact beam waist over a broad range of parameters of practical interest. Based on this, we describe a method of choosing parameters in the model given the beam waist and pulse duration of a laser pulse.",0
"In this paper, we construct maximally monotone operators that are not of Gossez's dense-type (D) in many nonreflexive spaces. Many of these operators also fail to possess the Br{\o}nsted-Rockafellar (BR) property. Using these operators, we show that the partial inf-convolution of two BC--functions will not always be a BC--function. This provides a negative answer to a challenging question posed by Stephen Simons. Among other consequences, we deduce that every Banach space which contains an isomorphic copy of the James space $\mathbf{J}$ or its dual $\mathbf{J}^*$, or $c_0$ or its dual $\ell^1$, admits a non type (D) operator.",0
"Heterostructures composed of dissimilar two-dimensional nanomaterials can have nontrivial physical and mechanical properties promising for many applications. Interestingly, in some cases, it is possible to create heterostructures composed of weakly and strongly stretched domains with the same chemical composition, as it has been demonstrated for some polymer chains, DNA, and intermetallic nanowires supporting this effect of two-phase stretching. These materials at relatively strong tension forces split into domains with smaller and larger tensile strain. Within this region, average strain increases at constant tensile force due to the growth of the domain with the larger strain in the expense of the domain with smaller strain. Here the two-phase stretching phenomenon is described for graphene nanoribbons with the help of molecular dynamics simulations. This unprecedented feature of graphene revealed in our study is related to the peculiarities of nucleation and motion of the domain walls separating the domains with different elastic strain. It turns out that the loading-unloading curves exhibit a hysteresis-like behavior due to the energy dissipation during the domain wall nucleation and motion. Here, we originally put forward the idea of implementing graphene nanoribbons as elastic dampers, efficiently converting mechanical strain energy into heat during cyclic loading-unloading through elastic extension where domains with larger and smaller strain coexist. Furthermore, in the regime of two-phase stretching, graphene nanoribbon is a heterostructure for which the fraction of domains with larger and smaller strain, and consequently its physical and mechanical properties, can be tuned in a controllable manner by applying elastic strain and/or heat.",0
"Many quantum measurements, such as photodetection, can be destructive. In photodetection, when the detector clicks a photon has been absorbed and destroyed. Yet the lack of a click also gives information about the presence or absence of a photon. In monitoring the emission of photons from a source, one decomposes the strong measurement into a series of weak measurements, which describe the evolution of the state during the measurement process. Motivated by this example of destructive photon detection, a simple model of destructive weak measurements using qubits was studied in [1]. It has shown that the model can achieve any positive-operator valued measurement (POVM) with commuting POVM elements including projective measurements. In this paper, we use a different approach for decomposing any POVM into a series of weak measurements. The process involves three steps: randomly choose, with certain probabilities, a set of linearly independent POVM elements; perform that POVM by a series of destructive weak measurements; output the result of the series of weak measurements with certain probabilities. The probabilities of the outcomes from this process agree with those from the original POVM, and hence this model of destructive weak measurements can perform any qubit POVM.",0
"In this work, we study the dynamical robustness in a system consisting of both active and inactive oscillators. We analytically show that the dynamical robustness of such system is determined by the cross link density between active and inactive subpopulations, which depends on the specific process of inactivation. It is the multi-valued dependence of the cross link density on the control parameter, i.e., the ratio of inactive oscillators in the system, that leads to the fluctuation of the critical points. We further investigate how different network topologies and inactivation strategies affect the fluctuation. Our results explain why the fluctuation is more obvious in heterogeneous networks than in homogeneous ones, and why the low-degree nodes are crucial in terms of dynamical robustness. The analytical results are supported by numerical verifications.",0
"We study the time-averaged upper level occupation probability in a strongly driven two level system, particularly its dependence on the driving amplitude, frequency and the energy level separation. In contrast to the case of weak driving, when the positions of the resonances almost do not depend on the driving amplitude, in the case of the strong diving their positions are strongly amplitude-dependent. We study these resonances in the concrete system -- the strongly driven phase-biased Cooper-pair box, which is considered to be weakly coupled to the tank circuit.",0
"The fragmentation of the Affleck-Dine condensate is studied by utilizing 3+1 dimensional numerical simulations. The 3+1 dimensional simulations confirm that the fragmentation process is very similar to the results obtained by 2+1 dimensional simulations. We find, however, that the average size of Q-balls in 3+1 dimensions is somewhat larger that in 2+1 dimensions. A filament type structure in the charge density is observed during the fragmentation process. The resulting final Q-ball distribution is strongly dependent on the initial conditions of the condensate and approaches a thermal one as the energy-charge ratio of the Affleck-Dine condensate increases.",0
"The tail of the distribution of a sum of a random number of independent and identically distributed nonnegative random variables depends on the tails of the number of terms and of the terms themselves. This situation is of interest in the collective risk model, where the total claim size in a portfolio is the sum of a random number of claims. If the tail of the claim number is heavier than the tail of the claim sizes, then under certain conditions the tail of the total claim size does not change asymptotically if the individual claim sizes are replaced by their expectations. The conditions allow the claim number distribution to be of consistent variation or to be in the domain of attraction of a Gumbel distribution with a mean excess function that grows to infinity sufficiently fast. Moreover, the claim number is not necessarily required to be independent of the claim sizes.",0
"The theory of planetary dynamos and its applications to observed phenomena of planetary magnetism are outlined. It is generally accepted that convection flows driven by thermal or compositional buoyancy are the most likely source for the sustenance of global planetary magnetic fields. While the existence of dynamos in electrically conducting fluid planetary cores provides constraints on properties of the latter, the lack of knowledge about time dependences of the magnetic fields and about their toroidal components together with the restricted parameter regions accessible to theory have prevented so far a full understanding of the phenomena of planetary magnetism.",0
"The Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM) can provide the correct neutralino relic abundance and baryon number asymmetry of the universe. Both may be efficiently generated in the presence of CP violating phases, light charginos and neutralinos, and a light top squark. Due to the coannihilation of the neutralino with the light stop, we find a large region of parameter space in which the neutralino relic density is consistent with WMAP and SDSS data. We perform a detailed study of the additional constraints induced when CP violating phases, consistent with the ones required for baryogenesis, are included. We explore the possible tests of this scenario from present and future electron Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) measurements, direct neutralino detection experiments, collider searches and the b -> s gamma decay rate. We find that the EDM constraints are quite severe and that electron EDM experiments, together with stop searches at the Tevatron and Higgs searches at the LHC, will provide a definite test of our scenario of electroweak baryogenesis in the next few years.",0
"One of the many open questions concerning Ionic Liquids (ILs) is the existence of nanoscale supramolecular domains which characterize the bulk. The hypothesis of their existence does not meet a general consensus since their definition seems to be based on ad hoc arbitrary criteria rather than on general and solid first principles of physics. In this work, we propose a suitable definition of supramolecular domains based on first principles of statistical mechanics. Such principles can be realized through the application of a recently developed computational tool which employs adaptive molecular resolution. The method can identify the smallest region of a liquid for which the atomistic details are strictly required, while the exterior plays the role of a generic structureless thermodynamic reservoir. We consider four different imidazolium-based ILs and show that indeed one can quantitatively represent the liquid as a collection of atomistically self-contained nanodroplets embedded in a generic thermodynamic bath. Such nanodroplets express a characteristic length scale for heterogeneity in ILs.",0
"Massive gravity is an old idea: trading geometry for mass. Much effort has been expended on establishing a healthy model, culminating in the current ghost-free version. We summarize here our recent findings -- that it is still untenable -- because it is locally acausal: CTC solutions can be constructed in a small neighborhood of any event.",0
"The dynamics of gravitational waves is investigated in full 3+1 dimensional numerical relativity, emphasizing the difficulties that one might encounter in numerical evolutions, particularly those arising from non-linearities and gauge degrees of freedom. Using gravitational waves with amplitudes low enough that one has a good understanding of the physics involved, but large enough to enable non-linear effects to emerge, we study the coupling between numerical errors, coordinate effects, and the nonlinearities of the theory. We discuss the various strategies used in identifying specific features of the evolution. We show the importance of the flexibility of being able to use different numerical schemes, different slicing conditions, different formulations of the Einstein equations (standard ADM vs. first order hyperbolic), and different sets of equations (linearized vs. full Einstein equations). A non-linear scalar field equation is presented which captures some properties of the full Einstein equations, and has been useful in our understanding of the coupling between finite differencing errors and non-linearites. We present a set of monitoring devices which have been crucial in our studying of the waves, including Riemann invariants, pseudo-energy momentum tensor, hamiltonian constraint violation, and fourier spectrum analysis.",0
"A large number of new black widow and redback energetic millisecond pulsars with irradiated stellar companions have been discovered through radio searches of unidentified \emph{Fermi} sources. We construct a 3D emission model of these systems to predict the high-energy emission components from particles accelerated to several TeV in the intrabinary shocks, and its predicted modulation at the binary orbital period. Synchrotron emission is expected at X-ray energies and such modulated emission has already been detected by \emph{Chandra} and \emph{XMM-Newton} in some systems. Synchrotron and inverse Compton emission from relativistic particles in the pulsar wind and intrabinary shock can probe the unknown physics of pulsar winds and relativistic shock acceleration in these compact binaries. Orbitally-modulated emission in the GeV and TeV bands may be detectable under some favorable conditions.",0
The hadron production in $e^+e^-$ collisions is studied assuming that particles originate in a hadron gas at thermal and chemical equilibrium. The parameters of the hadron gas are determined with a fit to the average multiplicities of various hadron species measured at LEP and PEP-PETRA colliders. An impressive agreement is found between the predictions of this model and data for almost all particles over a range of production rate of four orders of magnitude. The temperature values found at the centre of mass energies of LEP and PEP-PETRA are around $165$ MeV.,0
"We have investigated some features of the density and arrival time distributions of Cherenkov photons in extensive air showers using the CORSIKA simulation package. The main thrust of this study is to see the effect of hadronic interaction models on the production pattern of Cherenkov photons with respect to distance from the shower core. Such studies are very important in ground based $\gamma$-ray astronomy for an effective rejection of huge cosmic ray background, where the atmospheric Cherenkov technique is being used extensively within the energy range of some hundred GeV to few TeV. We have found that for all primary particles, the density distribution patterns of Cherenkov photons follow the negative exponential function with different coefficients and slopes depending on the type of primary particle, its energy and the type of interaction model combinations. Whereas the arrival time distribution patterns of Cherenkov photons follow the function of the form $t (r) = t_{0}e^{\Gamma/r^{\lambda}}$, with different values of the function parameters. There is no significant effect of hadronic interaction model combinations on the density and arrival time distributions for the $\gamma$-ray primaries. However, for the hadronic showers, the effects of the model combinations are significant under different conditions.",0
"This paper is concerned with the two--phase obstacle problem, a type of a variational free boundary problem. We recall the basic estimates of Repin and Valdman (2015) and verify them numerically on two examples in two space dimensions. A solution algorithm is proposed for the construction of the finite element approximation to the two--phase obstacle problem. The algorithm is not based on the primal (convex and nondifferentiable) energy minimization problem but on a dual maximization problem formulated for Lagrange multipliers. The dual problem is equivalent to a quadratic programming problem with box constraints. The quality of approximations is measured by a functional a posteriori error estimate which provides a guaranteed upper bound of the difference of approximated and exact energies of the primal minimization problem. The majorant functional in the upper bound contains auxiliary variables and it is optimized with respect to them to provide a sharp upper bound. A space density of the nonlinear related part of the majorant functional serves as an indicator of the free boundary.",0
"Still and multi-media images are subject to transformations for compression, steganographic embedding and digital watermarking. In a major program of activities we are engaged in the modeling, design and analysis of digital content. Statistical and pattern classification techniques should be combined with understanding of run length, transform coding techniques, and also encryption techniques.",0
Decomposing the Higgs potential $\mathcal{V}_{higgs}$ of next - to - Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (n-MSSM) \ as the sum of three contributions like $\mathcal{V}_{ch}+\mathcal{V}_{kah}+\mathcal{V}_{expl}$ and assuming the two following things: $\left( a\right) $ $\mathcal{V}_{higgs}$ dominated by $\mathcal{V}_{ch}$ coming from the chiral sector of supersymmetry: $\mathcal{V}_{ch}=\left \vert \mathrm{\nu }\right \vert ^{2}\mathcal{U}$ with $\left \vert \mathrm{\nu }\right \vert $ large and $\frac{\mathrm{r}}{\left \vert \mathrm{\nu }\right \vert }<<1$; and $\left( b\right) $ replacing the chiral down Higgs superfield doublet $\left( \boldsymbol{H}_{d}\right) ^{i}$ of n-MSSM by a chiral anti-doublet $\left( \boldsymbol{\Phi}_{d}\right) _{i}$; we derive the explicit geometry of the Higgs fields in the ground state $\left \vert \Sigma _{higgs}\right \rangle $ found to be given by two intersecting conifolds. We show as well that the property $\tan \beta _{susy}=1$ living at singularity $r=0$ is a supersymmetric signal; and deviation away reads in terms of the Kahler parameter $r$ and the $\vartheta_{_{W}}$- Weinberg angle as $\tan \beta \simeq1+\frac{\mathrm{r}}{2\left \vert \mathrm{\nu }\right \vert }\sin^{2}\vartheta _{_{W}}$. Other related issues are also studied.,0
"A pseudo-Galois extension is shown to be a depth two extension. Studying its left bialgebroid, we construct an enveloping Hopf algebroid for the semi-direct product of groups, or more generally involutive Hopf algebras, and their module algebras. It is a type of cofibered sum of two inclusions of the Hopf algebra into the semi-direct product and its derived right crossed product. Van Oystaeyen and Panaite observe that this Hopf algebroid is non-trivially isomorphic to a Connes-Moscovici Hopf algebroid, which raises interesting comparative questions.",0
"A modern radar may be designed to perform multiple functions, such as surveillance, tracking, and fire control. Each function requires the radar to execute a number of transmit-receive tasks. A radar resource management (RRM) module makes decisions on parameter selection, prioritization, and scheduling of such tasks. RRM becomes especially challenging in overload situations, where some tasks may need to be delayed or even dropped. In general, task scheduling is an NP-hard problem. In this work, we develop the branch-and-bound (B&B) method which obtains the optimal solution but at exponential computational complexity. On the other hand, heuristic methods have low complexity but provide relatively poor performance. We resort to machine learning-based techniques to address this issue; specifically we propose an approximate algorithm based on the Monte Carlo tree search method. Along with using bound and dominance rules to eliminate nodes from the search tree, we use a policy network to help to reduce the width of the search. Such a network can be trained using solutions obtained by running the B&B method offline on problems with feasible complexity. We show that the proposed method provides near-optimal performance, but with computational complexity orders of magnitude smaller than the B&B algorithm.",0
"Several early Universe scenarios predict a direction-dependent spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations. This translates into the violation of the statistical isotropy of cosmic microwave background radiation. Previous searches for statistical anisotropy mainly focussed on a quadrupolar direction-dependence characterised by a single multipole vector and an overall amplitude $g_*$. Generically, however, the quadrupole has a more complicated geometry described by two multipole vectors and $g_*$. This is the subject of the present work. In particular, we limit the amplitude $g_*$ for different shapes of the quadrupole by making use of Planck 2015 maps. We also constrain certain inflationary scenarios which predict this kind of more general quadrupolar statistical anisotropy.",0
"Here we propose the generalized statistical multifragmentation model which includes the liquid phase pressure of the most general form. This allows us to get rid of the absolute incompressibility of the nuclear liquid. Also the present model employes a very general form the surface tension coefficient of nuclear fragments. Such a model is solved analytically for finite volumes by the Laplace-Fourier transform method to isobaric ensemble. A complete analysis of the isobaric partition singularities of this model is also done for finite volumes. It is shown that the real part of any simple pole of the isobaric partition defines the free energy of the corresponding state, whereas its imaginary part, depending on the sign, defines the inverse decay/formation time of this state. The developed formalism allows us to exactly define the finite volume analogs of gaseous, liquid and mixed phases of the class of similar models from the first principles of statistical mechanics and demonstrate the pitfalls of earlier works. The finite width effects for large nuclear fragments and quark gluon bags are also discussed.",0
"Combined analyses of the Higgs boson production and decay rates as well as its coupling strengths to vector bosons and fermions are presented. The combinations include the results of the analyses of the $H\to\gamma\gamma,\, ZZ^*,\, WW^*,\, Z\gamma,\, b\bar{b},\, \tau\tau$ and $\mu\mu$ decay modes, and the constraints on the associated production with a pair of top quarks and on the off-shell coupling strengths of the Higgs boson. The results are based on the LHC proton-proton collision datasets, with integrated luminosities of up to 4.7 $\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV and 20.3 $\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV, recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2011 and 2012. Combining all production modes and decay channels, the measured signal yield, normalised to the Standard Model expectation, is $1.18^{+0.15}_{-0.14}$. The observed Higgs boson production and decay rates are interpreted in a leading-order coupling framework, exploring a wide range of benchmark coupling models both with and without assumptions on the Higgs boson width and on the Standard Model particle content in loop processes. The data are found to be compatible with the Standard Model expectations for a Higgs boson at a mass of 125.36 GeV for all models considered.",0
"Optical mushroom shaped billiards offer a unique opportunity to isolate and study non-dispersive, marginally unstable periodic orbits. Here we show that the openness of the cavity to external fields presents unanticipated consequences for the far-field distribution, including directional emission. This is mediated by interactions of marginally unstable periodic orbits with chaotic modes and is potentially relevant for the design of microcavity lasers. We also show that such orbits are robust against perturbations to the shape of the cavity, despite the non-generic character of the classical counterpart and the lack of structural stability of the corresponding classical orbits.",0
Tumour cells have to acquire a number of capabilities if a neoplasm is to become a cancer. One of these key capabilities is increased motility which is needed for invasion of other tissues and metastasis. This paper presents a qualitative mathematical model based on game theory and computer simulations using cellular automata. With this model we study the circumstances under which mutations that confer increased motility to cells can spread through a tumour made of rapidly proliferating cells. The analysis suggests therapies that could help prevent the progression towards malignancy and invasiveness of benign tumours.,0
"We consider mixed integer linear programs where free integer variables are expressed in terms of nonnegative continuous variables. When this model only has two integer variables, Dey and Louveaux characterized the intersection cuts that have infinite split rank. We show that, for any number of integer variables, the split rank of an intersection cut generated from a bounded convex set $P$ is finite if and only if the integer points on the boundary of $P$ satisfy a certain """"2-hyperplane property"""". The Dey-Louveaux characterization is a consequence of this more general result.",0
"The cold dark matter (CDM) scenario for structure formation in the Universe is very attractive and has many successes; however, when its spectrum of density perturbations is normalized to the COBE anisotropy measurement the level of inhomogeneity predicted on small scales is too large. This can be remedied by a tau neutrino of mass $1\MeV - 10\MeV$ and lifetime $0.1\sec - 100\sec$ whose decay products include electron neutrinos because it allows the total energy density in relativistic particles to be doubled without interfering with nucleosynthesis. The anisotropies predicted on the degree scale for ``$\tau$CDM'' are larger than standard CDM. Experiments at $e^\pm$ colliders may be able to probe such a mass range.",0
"Based on a gambling formulation of quantum mechanics, we derive a Gleason-type theorem that holds for any dimension n of a quantum system, and in particular for n = 2. The theorem states that the only logically consistent probability assignments are exactly the ones that are definable as the trace of the product of a projector and a density matrix operator. In addition, we detail the reason why dispersion-free probabilities are actually not valid, or rational, probabilities for quantum mechanics, and hence should be excluded from consideration.",0
"We investigate the design of the optimal routing path in a moving vehicles involved the internet of things (IoT). In our model, jammers exist that may interfere with the information exchange between wireless nodes, leading to worsened quality of service (QoS) in communications. In addition, the transmit power of each battery-equipped node is constrained to save energy. We propose a three-step optimal routing path algorithm for reliable and energy-efficient communications. Moreover, results show that with the assistance of moving vehicles, the total energy consumed can be reduced to a large extend. We also study the impact on the optimal routing path design and energy consumption which is caused by path loss, maximum transmit power constrain, QoS requirement, etc.",0
We find evidence for dust in the intervening QSO absorbers from the spectra of QSOs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 1. No evidence is found for the 2175 A feature which is present in the Milky Way dust extinction curve. The extinction curve resembles the SMC extinction curve. The observed Delta(g-i) excess for QSOs with strong absorption systems appears to be a result of the reddening due to dust in the intervening absorbers.,0
"Amyloid precursor with 770 amino acids dimerizes and aggregates, as do its c terminal 99 amino acids and amyloid 40,42 amino acids fragments. The titled question has been discussed extensively, and here it is addressed further using thermodynamic scaling theory to analyze mutational trends in structural factors and kinetics. Special attention is given to Family Alzheimer's Disease mutations outside amyloid 42. The scaling analysis is connected to extensive docking simulations which included membranes, thereby confirming their results and extending them to Amyloid precursor.",0
"Cubical rectangles are being defined and explored here over the $n-$dimensional geometric cube $Q_n.$ They form a new class of geometric objects that includes all the edges and all the squares of the $n-$cube. We enumerate and characterize them here in order to construct new posets, transforming into special lattices that will be called rectangular lattices. We show that rectangular lattices are closely related to the class of cubical lattices, that is, the face lattice of the $n-$cube.",0

"Associated to every finite simplicial complex $K$, there is a moment-angle complex $\mathcal {Z}_{K}$. In this paper, we use some algebraic invariants to solve the $B$-rigidity problem for some special simplicial compelexes.",0
"Recent precision cosmological parameter constraints imply that the spatial curvature of the Universe is essentially dynamically negligible - but only if relatively strong assumptions are made about the equation of state of dark energy (DE). When these assumptions are relaxed, strong degeneracies arise that make it hard to disentangle DE and curvature, degrading the constraints. We show that forthcoming 21cm intensity mapping experiments such as HIRAX are ideally designed to carry out model-independent curvature measurements, as they can measure the clustering signal at high redshift with sufficient precision to break many of the degeneracies. We consider two different model-independent methods, based on `avoiding' the DE-dominated regime and non-parametric modelling of the DE equation of state respectively. Our forecasts show that HIRAX will be able to improve upon current model-independent constraints by around an order of magnitude, reaching percent-level accuracy even when an arbitrary DE equation of state is assumed. In the same model-independent analysis, the sample variance limit for a similar survey is another order of magnitude better.",0
"The merger of two white dwarfs is expected to result in a central fast rotating core surrounded by a debris disk, in which magnetorotational instabilities give rise to a hot magnetized corona and a magnetized outflow. The dissipation of magnetic energy via reconnection could lead to the acceleration of cosmic-rays in the expanding material, which would result in high energy neutrinos. We discuss the possibility of using these neutrino signals as probes of the outflow dynamics, magnetic energy dissipation rate and cosmic-ray acceleration efficiency. Importantly, the accompanying high-energy gamma-rays are absorbed within these sources because of the large optical depth, so these neutrino sources can be regarded as hidden cosmic-ray accelerators that are consistent with the non-detection of gamma-rays with Fermi-LAT. While the cosmic-ray generation rate is highly uncertain, if it reaches $\sim10^{45}\,\rm erg\,Mpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}$, the diffuse neutrino flux could contribute a substantial fraction of the IceCube observations. We also evaluate the prospect of observing individual merger events, which provides a means for testing such sources in the future.",0
"Semantic segmentation is a crucial task in biomedical image processing, which recent breakthroughs in deep learning have allowed to improve. However, deep learning methods in general are not yet widely used in practice since they require large amount of data for training complex models. This is particularly challenging for biomedical images, because data and ground truths are a scarce resource. Annotation efforts for biomedical images come with a real cost, since experts have to manually label images at pixel-level on samples usually containing many instances of the target anatomy (e.g. in histology samples: neurons, astrocytes, mitochondria, etc.). In this paper we provide a framework for Deep Active Learning applied to a real-world scenario. Our framework relies on the U-Net architecture and overall uncertainty measure to suggest which sample to annotate. It takes advantage of the uncertainty measure obtained by taking Monte Carlo samples while using Dropout regularization scheme. Experiments were done on spinal cord and brain microscopic histology samples to perform a myelin segmentation task. Two realistic small datasets of 14 and 24 images were used, from different acquisition settings (Serial Block-Face Electron Microscopy and Transmitting Electron Microscopy) and showed that our method reached a maximum Dice value after adding 3 uncertainty-selected samples to the initial training set, versus 15 randomly-selected samples, thereby significantly reducing the annotation effort. We focused on a plausible scenario and showed evidence that this straightforward implementation achieves a high segmentation performance with very few labelled samples. We believe our framework may benefit any biomedical researcher willing to obtain fast and accurate image segmentation on their own dataset. The code is freely available at https://github.com/neuropoly/deep-active-learning.",0
"We have searched for infrared emission from supernova remnants (SNRs) included in the Spitzer Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire (GLIMPSE) field. At the positions of 100 known SNRs, we made 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 um band images covering the radio continuum emitting area of each remnant. In-depth examinations of four band images based on the radio continuum images of SNRs result in the identification of sixteen infrared SNRs in the GLIMPSE field. Eight SNRs show distinct infrared emission in nearly all the four bands, and the other eight SNRs are visible in more than one band. We present four band images for all identified SNRs, and RGB-color images for the first eight SNRs. These images are the first high resolution (<2"""") images with comparative resolution of the radio continuum for SNRs detected in the mid-infrared region. The images typically show filamentary emission along the radio enhanced SNR boundaries. Most SNRs are well identified in the 4.5 and 5.8 um bands. We give a brief description of the infrared features of the identified SNRs.",0
"We propose theoretically that a magnetic field can realize spin-triplet superconductivity in repulsively interacting electron systems having strong ferromagnetic spin fluctuations. We confirm the general idea for the low-density Hubbard model on a triangular lattice, whose Fermi surface consists of disconnected pieces, by calculating the pairing susceptibility in a moderate magnetic field with the quantum Monte-Carlo method combined with the dynamical cluster approximation.",0
"To account for the range of stellar metallicities in local galaxies and for the increasing importance of low metallicities at higher redshift we present chemically consistent models for the spectral and chemical evolution of galaxies over cosmological timescales.

"Open clusters and young stellar associations are attractive sites to search for planets and to test theories of planet formation, migration, and evolution. We present our search for, and characterization of, transiting planets in the ~800 Myr old Praesepe (Beehive, M44) Cluster from K2 light curves. We identify seven planet candidates, six of which we statistically validate to be real planets, the last of which requires more data. For each host star we obtain high-resolution NIR spectra to measure its projected rotational broadening and radial velocity, the latter of which we use to confirm cluster membership. We combine low-resolution spectra with the known cluster distance and metallicity to provide precise temperatures, masses, radii, and luminosities for the host stars. Combining our measurements of rotational broadening, rotation periods, and our derived stellar radii, we show that all planetary orbits are consistent with alignment to their host star's rotation. We fit the K2 light curves, including priors on stellar density to put constraints on the planetary eccentricities, all of which are consistent with zero. The difference between the number of planets found in Praesepe and Hyades (8 planets) and a similar dataset for Pleiades (0 planets, ~125 Myr) suggests a trend with age, but may be due to incompleteness of current search pipelines for younger, faster-rotating stars. We see increasing evidence that some planets continue to lose atmosphere past 800 Myr, as now two planets at this age have radii significantly larger than their older counterparts from Kepler.",0
"The recently synthesized silicene as well as theoretically discussed germanene are examples of buckled honeycomb structures. The buckled structures allow one to manipulate asymmetry between two underlying sublattices of honeycomb structures. Here by taking germanene as a prototype of buckled honeycomb lattices, we explore magnetism induced by breaking sublattice symmetry through saturating chemical bonds on one-side of the buckled honeycomb lattice. It is shown that when fractions of chemical bonds on one-side are saturated, two narrow bands always exist at half filling. Furthermore, the narrow bands generally support flat band ferromagnetism in the presence of the Hubbard $U$ interaction. The induced magnetization is directly related to the saturation fraction and is thus controllable in magnitude through the saturation fraction. Most importantly, we find that depending on the saturation fraction, the ground state of an one-side saturated germanene may become a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator characterized by a Chern number that vanishes for larger magnetization. The non-vanishing Chern number for smaller magnetization implies that the associated quantum Hall effect tends to survive at high temperatures. Our findings provide a potential method to engineer buckled honeycomb structures into high-temperature QAH insulators.",0
"We evaluate the master integrals for the two-loop, planar box-diagrams contributing to the elastic scattering of muons and electrons at next-to-next-to leading-order in QED. We adopt the method of differential equations and the Magnus exponential series to determine a canonical set of integrals, finally expressed as a Taylor series around four space-time dimensions, with coefficients written as combination of generalised polylogarithms. The electron is treated as massless, while we retain full dependence on the muon mass. The considered integrals are also relevant for crossing-related processes, such as di-muon production at $e^+ e^-$-colliders, as well as for the QCD corrections to $top$-pair production at hadron colliders.",0
"Conducting experiments and documenting results is daily business of scientists. Good and traceable documentation enables other scientists to confirm procedures and results for increased credibility. Documentation and scientific conduct are regulated and termed as """"good laboratory practice."""" Laboratory notebooks are used to record each step in conducting an experiment and processing data. Originally, these notebooks were paper based. Due to computerised research systems, acquired data became more elaborate, thus increasing the need for electronic notebooks with data storage, computational features and reliable electronic documentation. As a new approach to this, a scientific data management system (DataFinder) is enhanced with features for traceable documentation. Provenance recording is used to meet requirements of traceability, and this information can later be queried for further analysis. DataFinder has further important features for scientific documentation: It employs a heterogeneous and distributed data storage concept. This enables access to different types of data storage systems (e. g. Grid data infrastructure, file servers). In this chapter we describe a number of building blocks that are available or close to finished development. These components are intended for assembling an electronic laboratory notebook for use in Grid environments, while retaining maximal flexibility on usage scenarios as well as maximal compatibility overlap towards each other. Through the usage of such a system, provenance can successfully be used to trace the scientific workflow of preparation, execution, evaluation, interpretation and archiving of research data. The reliability of research results increases and the research process remains transparent to remote research partners.",0
"We work on the task of automatically designing a treatment plan from the findings included in the medical certificate written by the dentist. To develop an artificial intelligence system that deals with free-form certificates written by dentists, we annotate the findings and utilized the natural language processing approach. As a result of the experiment using 990 certificates, 0.585 F1-score was achieved for the task of extracting orthodontic problems from findings, and 0.584 correlation coefficient with the human ranking was achieved for the treatment prioritization task.",0
We study numerically the region above the critical temperature of the four dimensional Random Field Ising Model. Using a cluster dynamic we measure the connected and disconnected magnetic susceptibility and the connected and disconnected overlap susceptibility. We use a bimodal distribution of the field with $ h_R=0.35T $ for all temperatures and a lattice size L=16. Through a least-square fit we determine the critical exponents $ \gamma $ and $ \bar{\gamma} $. We find the magnetic susceptibility and the overlap susceptibility diverge at two different temperatures. This is coherent with the existence of a glassy phase above $ T_c $. Accordingly with other simulations we find $ \bar{\gamma}=2\gamma $. In this case we have a scaling theory with two indipendet critical exponents,0
"Geographic locations of cellular base stations sometimes can be well fitted with spatial homogeneous Poisson point processes. In this paper we make a complementary observation: In the presence of the log-normal shadowing of sufficiently high variance, the statistics of the propagation loss of a single user with respect to different network stations are invariant with respect to their geographic positioning, whether regular or not, for a wide class of empirically homogeneous networks. Even in perfectly hexagonal case they appear as though they were realized in a Poisson network model, i.e., form an inhomogeneous Poisson point process on the positive half-line with a power-law density characterized by the path-loss exponent. At the same time, the conditional distances to the corresponding base stations, given their observed propagation losses, become independent and log-normally distributed, which can be seen as a decoupling between the real and model geometry. The result applies also to Suzuki (Rayleigh-log-normal) propagation model. We use Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to empirically study the quality of the Poisson approximation and use it to build a linear-regression method for the statistical estimation of the value of the path-loss exponent.",0
"Chas and Sullivan proved the existence of a Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra structure in the homology of free loop spaces on closed finite dimensional smooth manifolds using chains and chain homotopies. This algebraic structure involves an associative product called the loop product, a Lie bracket called the loop bracket, and a square 0 operator called the BV operator. Cohen and Jones gave a homotopy theoretic description of the loop product in terms of spectra. In this paper, we give an explicit homotopy theoretic description of the loop bracket and, using this description, we give a homological proof of the BV identity connecting the loop product, the loop bracket, and the BV operator. The proof is based on an observation that the loop bracket and the BV derivation are given by the same cycle in the free loop space, except that they differ by parametrization of loops.",0
"In this paper, we generalize a result by Berman and Billig on weight modules over Lie algebras with polynomial multiplication. More precisely, we show that a highest weight module with an exp-polynomial ``highest weight'' has finite dimensional weight spaces. We also get a class of irreducible weight modules with finite dimensional weight spaces over generalized Virasoro algebras which do not occur over the classical Virasoro algebra.",0
"We present the technical realization of a compact system for performing experiments with cold $^{87}{\text{Rb}}$ and $^{39}{\text{K}}$ atoms in microgravity in the future. The whole system fits into a capsule to be used in the drop tower Bremen. One of the advantages of a microgravity environment is long time evolution of atomic clouds which yields higher sensitivities in atom interferometer measurements. We give a full description of the system containing an experimental chamber with ultra-high vacuum conditions, miniaturized laser systems, a high-power thulium-doped fiber laser, the electronics and the power management. In a two-stage magneto-optical trap atoms should be cooled to the low $\mu$K regime. The thulium-doped fiber laser will create an optical dipole trap which will allow further cooling to sub-$\mu$K temperatures. The presented system fulfills the demanding requirements on size and power management for cold atom experiments on a microgravity platform, especially with respect to the use of an optical dipole trap. A first test in microgravity, including the creation of a cold Rb ensemble, shows the functionality of the system.",0
"We explicitly calculate the $AdS_2 \times S^2 \times T^6$ transfer-matrix eigenvalues in the massless sector using the exact integrable S-matrix, for up to 5 particles. This enables us to conjecture the general pattern. We use the conjectured form of the eigenvalues to write down a set of massless Bethe ansatz equations. The same procedure applies to the relativistic as well as to the non-relativistic situation. In the relativistic case, the right and left modes decouple. We speculate that the relativistic massless Bethe ansatz we obtain in that case might capture the integrable structure of an underlying 2D critical theory. We finally take advantage of some remarkable simplifications to make progress in the massive case as well.",0
"The HBT-Analyzer is an universal tool for particle correlations analysis under the ROOT environment. It provides an efficient mixing mechanism, a wide range of correlation and monitoring functions, and a set of cuts that are applicable on different levels of analysis. Thanks to an object oriented design it is very easily extensible for particular user needs. It also enables easy resolution studies of Monte-Carlo simulated data. The general concept and design is presented as well as example analysis results obtained within ALICE experiment.",0
"For any subcritical index of regularity $s>3/2$, we prove the almost global well posedness for the 2-dimensional semilinear wave equation with the cubic nonlinearity in the derivatives, when the initial data are small in the Sobolev space $H^s\times H^{s-1}$ with certain angular regularity. The main new ingredient in the proof is an endpoint version of the generalized Strichartz estimates in the space $L^2_t L_{|x|}^\infty L^2_\theta ([0,T]\times \R^2)$. In the last section, we also consider the general semilinear wave equations with the spatial dimension $n\ge 2$ and the order of nonlinearity $p\ge 3$.",0
"I summarize the excitement of my role primarily in the early years of X-ray Astronomy. As a """"second-generation"""" X-ray astronomer, I was privileged to participate in the enormous advance of the field, both technically and astrophysically, that occurred in the late 1960's and 1970's. The remainder of my career has concentrated on the design, construction, calibration, operation, and scientific maintenance of the """"cathedral"""" that is the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. I contrast my early experiences with the current environment for the design and development of instrumentation, especially X-ray optics, which are absolutely essential for the development of the discipline. I express my concerns for the future of X-ray astronomy and offer specific suggestions that I hope will advance the discipline at a more effective and rapid pace.",0
"We study the secular dynamics of compact binaries (consisting of white dwarfs, neutron stars or black holes) with tertiary companions in hierarchical triple systems. As the inner binary (with initially negligible eccentricity) undergoes orbital decay due to gravitational radiation, its eccentricity can be excited by gravitational forcing from the tertiary. This excitation occurs when the triple system passes through an """"apsidal precession resonance"""", when the precession rate of the inner binary, driven by the gravitational perturbation of the external companion and general relativity, matches the precession rate of the outer binary. The eccentricity excitation requires the outer companion to be on an eccentric orbit, with the mutual inclination between the inner and outer orbits less than $\sim 40^\circ$. Gravitational wave (GW) signals from the inner binary can be significantly modified as the system evolves through the apsidal precession resonance. For some system parameters (e.g., a white dwarf binary with a brown dwarf tertiary), the resonance can happen when the binary emits GWs in the $10^{-4}-10^{-1}$~Hz range (the sensitivity band of LISA).",0

"Cuprous oxide (Cu2O) films from 25 nm to 1500 nm were electrodeposited on n-Si(100) and Ni/n-Si(100) substrates from aqueous solution at room temperature. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy imaging show that the Cu2O structure and morphology is strongly affected by the substrate choice, with V shape and U shape columnar growth on n-Si(100) and Ni/n-Si(100), respectively. Atomic force microscopy reveals the presence of rounded grains at the surface in both cases. Anomalous and normal roughening are observed in films grown on n-Si and Ni, respectively, but estimates of scaling exponents are not conclusive. On the other hand, the distributions of local heights, roughness, and extremal heights show good agreement with those of the fourth order linear stochastic equation of Mullins and Herring (MH). Thus, surface dynamics in both systems is dominated by diffusion of adsorbed molecules, with no large scale effect of possible inhomogeneities in mass flux from the solution or in reaction and adsorption rates. In growth on n-Si substrates, the noise amplitude of the MH equation increases in time as t^{0.8}, while the coefficient of the curvature-related term is time-independent. Step edge energy barriers restrict the mass flux across grain boundaries, thus a broad size distribution of initial grains leads to coarsening of the larger ones. This explains their V shape in the thickest films and establishes a connection with the anomalous roughening. These effects are reduced in films grown on Ni/n-Si, which initially have much larger grains with narrower size distributions and, consequently, smaller fluctuations in coarse grained growth rates.",0
Constraints on the Equation of State for symmetric matter (equal neutron and proton numbers) have been extracted from energetic collisions of heavy ions over a range of energies. Collisions of neutron-deficient and neutron-rich heavy ions now provide initial constraints on the EoS of neutron-rich matter at sub-saturation densities from isospin diffusions and neutron proton ratios. This article reviews the experimental constraints on the density dependence of Symmetry Energy at sub-saturation density.,0
"In the context of the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence, we investigate the Higgs branch CFT$_2$. Witten showed that states localised near the small instanton singularity can be described in terms of vector multiplet variables. This theory has a planar, weak-coupling limit, in which anomalous dimensions of single-trace composite operators can be calculated. At one loop, the calculation reduces to finding the spectrum of a spin-chain with nearest-neighbour interactions. This CFT$_2$ spin-chain matches precisely the one that was previously found as the weak-coupling limit of the integrable system describing the AdS$_3$ side of the duality. We compute the one-loop dilatation operator in a non-trivial compact subsector and show that it corresponds to an integrable spin-chain Hamiltonian. This provides the first direct evidence of integrability on the CFT$_2$ side of the correspondence.",0
"We establish the binary nonlinearization approach of the spectral problem of the super AKNS system, and then use it to obtain the super finite-dimensional integrable Hamiltonian system in supersymmetry manifold $\mathbb{R}^{4N|2N}$.

"We present the EUV fluxes derived from the recent """"combined stellar structure and atmosphere models"""" (CoStar models). The atmosphere models in particular account for the stellar wind and include non-LTE effects and line blanketing. We provide an extensive set of calculations from tracks between 20 and 120 Msun at Z=0.02 (solar metallicity) and Z=0.004. They cover the entire parameter space of O3--B0 stars of all luminosity classes. Model uncertainties are discussed in the light of recent EUV and X-ray observations. We show the importance of using adequate O star ionising fluxes for the interpretation of HII regions, young starbursts and related objects.",0
"Biaxial compression of centimetre-scale graphene, freely standing on the surface of water is studied. Within this platform, we report full stress-strain compression of graphene identifying elastic and plastic deformations. The Young's modulus follows a scaling law and falls two orders of magnitude below the commonly reported values with microscale graphene samples. Such results strongly confirm that graphene - in its very natural form - lacks any intrinsic elastic parameters. Different functionalization/manipulation of graphene lattice affects the mechanics of graphene differently; particularly the effect of the sp3 hybridization and crystalline voids on the yield strength of graphene is explored. Crumpling of graphene is accompanied by gradual generation and transformation of wrinkles which brings about viscoelasticity in graphene, observed for the first time in this paper. Additionally, we report a peculiar correlation between the morphology and the distribution of the strain in graphene lattice.",0
"This paper analyzes output feedback control of a class of unknown nonlinear systems in the presence of measurement noise using multiple high-gain observers (MHGO). It is well-known that single high-gain observers (HGO) are not able to provide satisfactory performance when the system output is contaminated by noise. More specifically, there is a trade-off between the convergence speed of state estimation and the bound of steady estimation error in HGO when the output measurement is contaminated by noise. In the presented scheme, the output feedback controller utilizes the state estimation obtained from an appropriate combination of information provided by a bank of HGOs. The proposed strategy is capable of mitigating the destructive effects of measurement noise and speeding up the convergence process, and it does that because it introduces an extra design parameter. The performance recovery capabilities of MHGO-based controllers and the stability of the closed-loop system are discussed. Simulations are performed on an underwater vehicle system and a mechanical system to evaluate the performance of the MHGO-based controller. Furthermore, a detailed comparison between the MHGO-based controller and controllers based on conventional HGO, HGO with switching gain, and multi-observer approach is provided, which shows the superiority of the MHG-based controller over the other methods.",0
Quantum phases of electrons in the filling factor range $2 \leq\nu\leq 3$ are probed by the weak optical emission from the partially populated second Landau level and spin wave measurements. Observations of optical emission include a multiplet of sharp peaks that exhibit a strong filling factor dependence. Spin wave measurements by resonant inelastic light scattering probe breaking of spin rotational invariance and are used to link this optical emission with collective phases of electrons. A remarkably rapid interplay between emission peak intensities manifests phase competition in the second Landau level.,0
"Gesture and signature passwords are two-dimensional figures created by drawing on the surface of a touchscreen with one or more fingers. Prior results about their security have used resilience to either shoulder surfing, a human observation attack, or dictionary attacks. These evaluations restrict generalizability since the results are: non-comparable to other password systems (e.g. PINs), harder to reproduce, and attacker-dependent. Strong statements about the security of a password system use an analysis of the statistical distribution of the password space, which models a best-case attacker who guesses passwords in order of most likely to least likely. Estimating the distribution of recognition passwords is challenging because many different trials need to map to one password. In this paper, we solve this difficult problem by: (1) representing a recognition password of continuous data as a discrete alphabet set, and (2) estimating the password distribution through modeling the unseen passwords. We use Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) to represent time series data as symbols and develop Markov chains to model recognition passwords. We use a partial guessing metric, which demonstrates how many guesses an attacker needs to crack a percentage of the entire space, to compare the security of the distributions for gestures, signatures, and Android unlock patterns. We found the lower bounds of the partial guessing metric of gestures and signatures are much higher than the upper bound of the partial guessing metric of Android unlock patterns.",0
"Constitutions help define domestic political orders, but are known to be influenced by two international mechanisms: one that reflects global temporal trends in legal development, and another that reflects international network dynamics such as shared colonial history. We introduce the provision space; the growing set of all legal provisions existing in the world's constitutions over time. Through this we uncover a third mechanism influencing constitutional change: hierarchical dependencies between legal provisions, under which the adoption of essential, fundamental provisions precedes more advanced provisions. This third mechanism appears to play an especially important role in the emergence of new political rights, and may therefore provide a useful roadmap for advocates of those rights. We further characterise each legal provision in terms of the strength of these mechanisms.",0
"Let $(X, f)$ be a topological dynamical system and $\mathcal {F}$ be a Furstenberg family (a collection of subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ with hereditary upward property). A point $x\in X$ is called an $\mathcal {F}$-transitive point if for every non-empty open subset $U$ of $X$ the entering time set of $x$ into $U$, $\{n\in \mathbb{N}: f^{n}(x) \in U\}$, is in $\mathcal {F}$; the system $(X,f)$ is called $\mathcal {F}$-point transitive if there exists some $\mathcal {F}$-transitive point. In this paper, we first discuss the connection between $\mathcal {F}$-point transitivity and $\mathcal {F}$-transitivity, and show that weakly mixing and strongly mixing systems can be characterized by $\mathcal {F}$-point transitivity, completing results in [Transitive points via Furstenberg family, Topology Appl. 158 (2011), 2221--2231]. We also show that multi-transitivity, $\Delta$-transitivity and multi-minimality can also be characterized by $\mathcal {F}$-point transitivity, answering two questions proposed by Kwietniak and Oprocha [On weak mixing, minimality and weak disjointness of all iterates, Erg. Th. Dynam. Syst., 32 (2012), 1661--1672].",0
"We prove that, given any finite link L in R^3, there is a high energy complex-valued eigenfunction of the harmonic oscillator such that its nodal set contains a union of connected components diffeomorphic to L. This solves a problem of Berry on the existence of knotted zeros in bound states of a quantum system.",0
"We use IllustrisTNG, a suite of gravity and MHD simulations, to study the demographics and properties of jellyfish galaxies in the full cosmological context. By jellyfish galaxies, we mean satellites orbiting in massive groups and clusters that exhibit highly asymmetric distributions of gas and gas tails. We use the TNG100 run and select galaxies at redshifts $z\le0.6$ with stellar mass exceeding $10^{9.5}{\rm M_\odot}$ and with host halo masses of $10^{13}-10^{14.6}\,{\rm M_\odot}$. Among more than about 6000 (2600) galaxies with stars (and some gas), we identify 800 jellyfish galaxies by visually inspecting their gas and stellar mass maps in random projections. About $31\%$ of cluster satellites are found with signatures of ram-pressure stripping and gaseous tails stemming from the main luminous bodies. This is a lower limit, since the random orientation entails a loss of about $30\%$ of galaxies that in an optimal projection would otherwise be identified as jellyfish. The connection with ram-pressure stripping is further confirmed by a series of findings: jellyfish galaxies are more frequent at intermediate and large cluster-centric distances ($r/R_{\rm 200c}\gtrsim 0.25$); they move through the ICM with larger bulk velocities and Mach numbers than the general cluster population, typically orbiting supersonically and experiencing larger ram pressures. Furthermore, the gaseous tails usually extend in opposite directions to the galaxy trajectory, with no relation between tail orientation and the host's center. The frequency of jellyfish galaxies shows a very weak dependence on redshift $(0\le z\le0.6)$ but larger fractions of disturbed gaseous morphologies occur in more massive hosts and at smaller satellite masses. Finally, jellyfish galaxies are late infallers ($< 2.5-3$ Gyrs ago, at $z=0$) and the emergence of gaseous tails correlates well with the presence of bow shocks in the ICM.",0
"In this paper, we let $\Hecke$ be the Hecke algebra associated with a finite Coxeter group $W$ and with one-parameter, over the ring of scalars $\Alg=\mathbb{Z}(q, q^{-1})$. With an elementary method, we introduce a cellular basis of $\Hecke$ indexed by the sets $E_J (J\subseteq S)$ and obtain a general theory of """"Specht modules"""". We provide an algorithm for $W\!$-graphs for the """"generic Specht module"""", which associates with the Kazhdan and Lusztig cell ( or more generally, a union of cells of $W$ ) containing the longest element of a parabolic subgroup $W_J$ for appropriate $J\subseteq S$. As an example of applications, we show a construction of $W\!$-graphs for the Hecke algebra of type $A$.",0
"Leptogenic Supersymmetry is a scenario characterized by copious lepton production in cascade decays. Due to the high lepton multiplicity and the lack of significant missing energy, leptogenic supersymmetry provides very clean channels which can be probed already with the early LHC data. Furthermore, the Higgs may be discovered in the h->b bbar mode because the leptons accompanying Higgs production efficiently suppress the background.",0
"In the solar neighborhood, where the typical relaxation timescale is larger than the cosmic age, at least 10\% to 15\% of Sun-like stars have planetary systems with Jupiter-mass planets. In contrast, dense star clusters, charactered by frequent close encounters, have been found to host very few planets. We carry out numerical simulations with different initial conditions to investigate the dynamical stability of planetary systems in star cluster environments.",0
We consider a smooth Poisson affine variety with the trivial canonical bundle over complex numbers. For such a variety the deformation quantization algebra A_h enjoys the conditions of the Van den Bergh duality theorem and the corresponding dualizing module is determined by an outer automorphism of A_h intrinsic to A_h. We show how this automorphism can be expressed in terms of the modular class of the corresponding Poisson variety. We also prove that the Van den Bergh dualizing module of the deformation quantization algebra A_h is free if and only if the corresponding Poisson structure is unimodular.,0
"The latest developments in 3D capturing, processing, and rendering provide means to unlock novel 3D application pathways. The main elements of an integrated platform, which target tele-immersion and future 3D applications, are described in this paper, addressing the tasks of real-time capturing, robust 3D human shape/appearance reconstruction, and skeleton-based motion tracking. More specifically, initially, the details of a multiple RGB-depth (RGB-D) capturing system are given, along with a novel sensors' calibration method. A robust, fast reconstruction method from multiple RGB-D streams is then proposed, based on an enhanced variation of the volumetric Fourier transform-based method, parallelized on the Graphics Processing Unit, and accompanied with an appropriate texture-mapping algorithm. On top of that, given the lack of relevant objective evaluation methods, a novel framework is proposed for the quantitative evaluation of real-time 3D reconstruction systems. Finally, a generic, multiple depth stream-based method for accurate real-time human skeleton tracking is proposed. Detailed experimental results with multi-Kinect2 data sets verify the validity of our arguments and the effectiveness of the proposed system and methodologies.",0
"The selective area growth of Ga-assisted GaAs nanowires (NWs) with a high vertical yield on Si(111) substrates is still challenging. Here, we explore different surface preparations and their impact on NW growth by molecular beam epitaxy. We show that boiling the substrate in ultrapure water leads to a significant improvement in the vertical yield of NWs (realizing 80%) grown on substrates patterned by electron-beam lithography (EBL). Tentatively, we attribute this improvement to a reduction in atomic roughness of the substrate in the mask opening. On this basis, we transfer our growth results to substrates processed by a technique that enables the efficient patterning of large arrays, nano imprint lithography (NIL). In order to obtain hole sizes below 50 nm, we combine the conventional NIL process with an indirect pattern transfer (NIL-IPT) technique. Thereby, we achieve smaller hole sizes than previously reported for conventional NIL and growth results that are comparable to those achieved on EBL patterned substrates.",0
"We present a new programming paradigm which can be useful, in particular, for implementing window interfaces and parallel algorithms. This paradigm allows a user to define operators which can contain nested operators. The new paradigm is called operator-oriented. One of the goals of this paradigm is to escape the complexity of objects definitions inherent in many object-oriented languages and to move to transparent algorithms definitions.",0
"The Research Unit in Bioinformatics at Rhodes University (RUBi), South Africa offers a Masters of Science in Bioinformatics. Growing demand for Bioinformatics qualifications results in applications from across Africa. Courses aim to bridge gaps in the diverse backgrounds of students who range from biologists with no prior computing exposure to computer scientists with no biology background. The programme is evenly split between coursework and research, with diverse modules from a range of departments covering mathematics, statistics, computer science and biology, with emphasis on application to bioinformatics research. The early focus on research helps bring students up to speed with working as a researcher. We measure success of the programme by the high rate of subsequent entry to PhD study: 10 out of 14 students who completed in the years 2011-2013.",0
"We investigate the effect of a density gradient on Chandrasekhar's dynamical friction formula based on the method of 2-body encounters in the local approximation. We apply these generalizations to the orbit evolution of satellite galaxies in Dark Matter haloes. We find from the analysis that the main influence occurs through a position-dependent maximum impact parameter in the Coulomb logarithm, which is determined by the local scale-length of the density distribution. We also show that for eccentric orbits the explicit dependence of the Coulomb logarithm on position yields significant differences for the standard homogeneous force. Including the velocity dependence of the Coulomb logarithm yields ambigous results. The orbital fits in the first few periods are further improved, but the deviations at later times are much larger. The additional force induced by the density gradient, the inhomogeneous force, is not antiparallel to the satellite motion and can exceed 10% of the homogeneous friction force in magnitude. However, due to the symmetry properties of the inhomogeneous force, there is a deformation and no secular effect on the orbit at the first order. Therefore the inhomogeneous force can be safely neglected for the orbital evolution of satellite galaxies. For the homogeneous force we compare numerical N-body calculations with semi-analytical orbits to determine quantitatively the accuracy of the generalized formulae of the Coulomb logarithm in the Chandresekhar approach. With the local scale-length as the maximum impact parameter we find a significant improvement of the orbital fits and a better interpretation of the quantitative value of the Coulomb logarithm.",0
"Recent empirical research has indicated that human graph reading performance improves when crossing angles increase. However, crossing angle has not been used as an aesthetic criterion for graph drawing algorithms so far. In this paper, we introduce a force-directed method that aims to construct graph drawings with large crossing angles. Experiments indicate that our method significantly increases crossing angles. Surprisingly, the experimental results further demonstrate that the resulting drawings produced by our method have fewer edge crossings, a shorter total edge length and more uniform edge lengths, compared to classical spring algorithms.",0
"Quantum oscillations are usually the manifestation of the underlying physical nature in condensed matter systems. Here we report a new type of log-periodic quantum oscillations in ultra-quantum three-dimensional topological materials. Beyond the quantum limit (QL), the log-periodic oscillations involving up to five oscillating cycles (5 peaks and 5 dips) are observed on the magnetoresistance (MR) of high quality single-crystal ZrTe5, virtually showing the clearest feature of discrete scale invariance (DSI). Further theoretical analyses show that the two-body quasi-bound states can be responsible for the DSI feature. Our work provides a new perspective on the ground state of topological materials beyond the QL.",0
"In this paper we demonstrate the necessity of including the generally omitted collective mode contributions in calculations of the Meissner effect for non-uniform superconductors. We consider superconducting pairing with non-zero center of mass momentum, as is relevant to high transition temperature cuprates, cold atoms, and quantum chromodynamic superconductors. For the concrete example of the Fulde-Ferrell phase we present a quantitative calculation of the superfluid density, showing the collective mode contributions are not only appreciable but that they derive from the amplitude mode of the order parameter. This latter mode (related to the Higgs mode in a charged system) is generally viewed as being invisible in conventional superconductors. However, our analysis shows that it is extremely important in pair-density wave type superconductors, where it destroys superfluidity well before the mean-field order parameter vanishes.",0
"The deep financial and economic crisis, which still characterizes these years, requires searching for tools in order to enhance knowledge sharing, creativity and innovation. The Internet is one of these tools that represents a practically infinite source of resources. In this perspective, the KnowInG project, funded by the STC programme MED, is aimed at developing the KnowInG Resource Centre (KRC), a sociotechnical system that works as a multiplier of innovation. KRC was conceived as a crowdsourcing platform allowing people, universities, research centres, organizations and companies to be active actors of creative and innovation processes from a local to a transnational level.",0
A continuum is hereditarily equivalent if it is homeomorphic to each of its non-degenerate sub-continua. We show in this paper that the arc and the pseudo-arc are the only non-degenerate hereditarily equivalent plane continua.,0
"Studies of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) usually focus on a language in which a specific aspect extension is integrated with a base language. Languages specified in this manner have a fixed, non-extensible AOP functionality. In this paper we consider the more general case of integrating a base language with a set of domain specific third-party aspect extensions for that language. We present a general mixin-based method for implementing aspect extensions in such a way that multiple, independently developed, dynamic aspect extensions can be subject to third-party composition and work collaboratively.",0
"For a finite group $G$, let $N(G)$ denote the set of conjugacy class sizes of $G$. We show that if every finite group $G$ with trivial center such that $N(G)$ equals to $N(Alt_n)$, where $n>1361$ and at least one of numbers $n$ or $n-1$ are decomposed into a sum of two primes, then $G\simeq Alt_n$.",0

"We explore the influence of dissipation on a paradigmatic driven-dissipative model where a collection of two level atoms interact with both quadratures of a quantum cavity mode. The closed system exhibits multiple phase transitions involving discrete and continuous symmetries breaking and all phases culminate in a multicritical point. In the open system, we show that infinitesimal dissipation erases the phase with broken continuous symmetry and radically alters the model's phase diagram. The multicritical point now becomes brittle and splits into two tricritical points where first- and second-order symmetry-breaking transitions meet. A quantum fluctuations analysis shows that, surprisingly, the tricritical points exhibit anomalous finite fluctuations, as opposed to standard tricritical points arising in $^3He-\text{}^4He$ mixtures. Our work has direct implications for a variety of fields, including cold atoms and ions in optical cavities, circuit-quantum electrodynamics as well as optomechanical systems.",0
"Ray stability is investigated in environments consisting of a range-independent background sound-speed profile on which a range-dependent perturbation, such as that produced by internal waves in deep ocean environments, is superimposed. Numerical results show that ray stability is strongly influenced by the background sound speed profile. Ray instability is shown to increase with increasing magnitude of alpha := I omega^{prime} / omega, where 2 pi / omega(I) is the range of a ray double loop and I is the ray action variable. The mechanism, shear-induced instability enhancement, by which alpha controls ray instability is described.",0
"Due to the rapidly increasing usage of personal mobile devices and the need of executing CVE applications in environments that have no previous network infrastructure, Mobile Collaborative Virtual Environments (MCVEs) systems will become ubiquitous in the future. In such systems, we enable users to act and interact in three dimensional world shared through their mobile devices in an ad-hoc network (MANET). A handful of interesting MCVE applications have been developed in a variety of domains, ranging from multiplayer games to virtual cities, virtual shopping malls, and various training simulations (i.e. military, emergency preparedness, Education, Medicine, etc.). The designers of such applications rely solely on network overhead, latency, limited bandwidth, and mobile device limitation. In this survey we present a number of ways to classify and analysis routing techniques that have been applied in Mobile Collaborative Environment Applications.",0
"The quaternionic spectral theorem has already been considered in the literature, see e.g. [22], [31], [32], however, except for the finite dimensional case in which the notion of spectrum is associated to an eigenvalue problem, see [21], it is not specified which notion of spectrum underlies the theorem. In this paper we prove the quaternionic spectral theorem for unitary operators using the $S$-spectrum. In the case of quaternionic matrices, the $S$-spectrum coincides with the right-spectrum and so our result recovers the well known theorem for matrices. The notion of $S$-spectrum is relatively new, see [17], and has been used for quaternionic linear operators, as well as for $n$-tuples of not necessarily commuting operators, to define and study a noncommutative versions of the Riesz-Dunford functional calculus. The main tools to prove the spectral theorem for unitary operators are the quaternionic version of Herglotz's theorem, which relies on the new notion of $q$-positive measure, and quaternionic spectral measures, which are related to the quaternionic Riesz projectors defined by means of the $S$-resolvent operator and the $S$-spectrum. The results in this paper restore the analogy with the complex case in which the classical notion of spectrum appears in the Riesz-Dunford functional calculus as well as in the spectral theorem.",0
"The question of how large Bell inequality violations can be, for quantum distributions, has been the object of much work in the past several years. We say that a Bell inequality is normalized if its absolute value does not exceed 1 for any classical (i.e. local) distribution. Upper and (almost) tight lower bounds have been given for the quantum violation of these Bell inequalities in terms of number of outputs of the distribution, number of inputs, and the dimension of the shared quantum states. In this work, we revisit normalized Bell inequalities together with another family: inefficiency-resistant Bell inequalities. To be inefficiency-resistant, the Bell value must not exceed 1 for any local distribution, including those that can abort. This makes the Bell inequality resistant to the detection loophole, while a normalized Bell inequality is resistant to general local noise. Both these families of Bell inequalities are closely related to communication complexity lower bounds. We show how to derive large violations from any gap between classical and quantum communication complexity, provided the lower bound on classical communication is proven using these lower bound techniques. This leads to inefficiency-resistant violations that can be exponential in the size of the inputs. Finally, we study resistance to noise and inefficiency for these Bell inequalities.",0
"The cosmological constant problem arises because the magnitude of vacuum energy density predicted by quantum mechanics is about 120 orders of magnitude larger than the value implied by cosmological observations of accelerating cosmic expansion. Recently, some of the current authors proposed that the stochastic nature of the quantum vacuum can resolve this tension [Q, Wang, Z. Zhu, and W. G. Unruh, Phys. Rev. D 95, 103504, 2017]. By treating the fluctuations in the vacuum seriously and allowing fluctuations up to some high-energy cutoff at which Quantum Field Theory is believed to break down, a parametric resonance effect arises that leads to a slow expansion and acceleration. In this work, we thoroughly examine the implications of this proposal by investigating the resulting dynamics. First, we improve upon numerical calculations in the original work and show that convergence issues had overshadowed some important effects. Correct calculations reverse some of the conclusions in [Q. Wang, Z. Zhu, and W. G. Unruh, Phys. Rev. D 95, 103504, 2017], however the premise that parametric resonance can explain a very slowly accelerating expansion appears to remain sound. After improving the resolution and efficiency of the numerical tests, we explore a wider range of cutoff energies, and examine the effects of multiple particle fields. We introduce a simple model using the Mathieu equation (a prototypical example of parametric resonance), and find that it closely matches numerical results in regimes where its assumptions are valid. Using this model, we extrapolate to find that in a universe with 28 bosonic fields and a high-energy cutoff 40 times higher than the Planck energy, the acceleration would be comparable to what is observed.",0
"We present an uncertainty quantification methodology for density estimation from Background Oriented Schlieren (BOS) measurements, in order to provide local, instantaneous, a-posteriori uncertainty bounds on each density measurement in the field of view. Displacement uncertainty quantification algorithms from cross-correlation based Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) are used to estimate the uncertainty in the dot pattern displacements obtained from cross-correlation for BOS and assess their feasibility. In order to propagate the displacement uncertainty through the density integration procedure, we also develop a novel methodology via the Poisson solver using sparse linear operators. Testing the method using synthetic images of a Gaussian density field showed agreement between the propagated density uncertainties and the true uncertainty. Subsequently the methodology is experimentally demonstrated for supersonic flow over a wedge, showing that regions with sharp changes in density lead to an increase in density uncertainty throughout the field of view, even in regions without these sharp changes. The uncertainty propagation is influenced by the density integration scheme, and for the Poisson solver the density uncertainty increases monotonically on moving away from the regions where the Dirichlet boundary conditions are specified.",0
"In this paper, utilizing recent theoretical results in high dimensional statistical modeling, we propose a model-free yet computationally simple approach to estimate the partially linear model $Y=X\beta+g(Z)+\varepsilon$. Motivated by the partial consistency phenomena, we propose to model $g(Z)$ via incidental parameters. Based on partitioning the support of $Z$, a simple local average is used to estimate the response surface. The proposed method seeks to strike a balance between computation burden and efficiency of the estimators while minimizing model bias. Computationally this approach only involves least squares. We show that given the inconsistent estimator of $g(Z)$, a root $n$ consistent estimator of parametric component $\beta$ of the partially linear model can be obtained with little cost in efficiency. Moreover, conditional on the $\beta$ estimates, an optimal estimator of $g(Z)$ can then be obtained using classic nonparametric methods. The statistical inference problem regarding $\beta$ and a two-population nonparametric testing problem regarding $g(Z)$ are considered. Our results show that the behavior of test statistics are satisfactory. To assess the performance of our method in comparison with other methods, three simulation studies are conducted and a real dataset about risk factors of birth weights is analyzed.",0
We study Witten's background independent open-string field theory in the presence of a constant B-field at one loop level. The Green's function and the partition function with a constant B-field are evaluated for an annulus.,0
"We propose that one of the best grounds for the materials design from the viewpoint of {\it electron correlation} such as ferromagnetism, superconductivity is the atomically controlled nanostructures and heterointerfaces, as theoretically demonstrated here from three examples with first-principles calculations: (i) Band ferromagnetism in a purely organic polymer of five-membered rings, where the flat-band ferromagnetism due to the electron-electron repulsion is proposed. (ii) Metal-induced gap states (MIGS) of about one atomic monolayer thick at insulator/metal heterointerfaces, recently detected experimentally, for which an exciton-mechanism superconductivity is considered. (iii) Alkali-metal doped zeolite, a class of nanostructured host-guest systems, where ferromagnetism has been experimentally discovered, for which a picture of the """"supercrystal"""" composed of """"superatoms"""" is proposed and Mott-insulator properties are considered. These indicate that design of electron correlation is indeed a promising avenue for nanostructures and heterointerfaces.",0
"In the present contribution, we discuss the behavior of Skyrme forces when they are employed to study both neutron stars and giant resonance states in 208Pb within the fully self-consistent Random Phase Approximation (RPA). We point out that clear correlations exist between the results for the isoscalar monopole and isovector dipole resonances (ISGMR and IVGDR), and definite quantities which characterize the equation of state (EOS) of uniform matter. We propose that the RPA results or, to some extent, the mentioned EOS parameters, are used as constraints when a force is fitted. This suggestion can be valid also when the fit of a more general energy density functional is envisaged. We use our considerations to select a limited number of Skyrme forces (10) out of a large sample of 78 interactions.",0
The current experimental status of neutrino physics is reviewed. It contains the evidences for a non-vanishing neutrino rest mass from neutrino oscillation searches. In addition an outlook is given on determining the various mixing matrix elements and mass differences more precisely with new experiments. Of special interest is the value of the mixing angle \theta_{13} determining the possibility of detecting leptonic CP violation in the future. The prospect for absolute mass measurements using beta and double beta decay as well as cosmological observations is presented.,0
"We prescribe a pseudo-Newtonian vector potential for studying accretion disks around Kerr black holes. The potential is useful to study the inner properties of disk not confined to the equatorial plane where general relativistic effect is indispensable. Therefore, we incorporate the essential properties of the metric at the inner radii through the pseudo-Newtonian potential derived from the general Kerr spacetime. The potential, reproducing most of the salient features of the general-relativity, is valid for entire regime of Kerr parameter. It reproduces the last stable circular orbit exactly as that in the Kerr geometry. It also reproduces last bound orbit and energy at last stable circular orbit with a maximum error ~7% and ~15% respectively upto an orbital inclination 30 degree.",0
"It is shown that $3$ disjoint sets with fixed Gaussian volumes that partition $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with nearly minimum total Gaussian surface area must be close to adjacent $120$ degree sectors, when $n\geq2$. These same results hold for any number $m\leq n+1$ of sets partitioning $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, conditional on the solution of a finite-dimensional optimization problem (similar to the endpoint case of the Plurality is Stablest Problem, or the Propeller Conjecture of Khot and Naor). When $m>3$, the minimal Gaussian surface area is achieved by the cones over a regular simplex. We therefore strengthen the Milman-Neeman Gaussian multi bubble theorem to a """"stability"""" statement. Consequently, we obtain the first known dimension-independent bounds for the Plurality is Stablest Conjecture for three candidates for a small amount of noise (and for $m>3$ candidates, conditional on the solution of a finite-dimensional optimization problem). In particular, we classify all stable local minima of the Gaussian surface area of $m$ sets. We focus exclusively on volume-preserving variations of the sets, avoiding the use of matrix-valued partial differential inequalities. Lastly, we remove the convexity assumption from our previous result on the minimum Gaussian surface area of a symmetric set of fixed Gaussian volume.",0
"We point out that type I string theory in the presence of internal magnetic fields provides a concrete realization of split supersymmetry. To lowest order, gauginos are massless while squarks and sleptons are superheavy. We build such realistic U(3)xU(2)xU(1) models on stacks of magnetized D9-branes. Though not unified into a simple group, these theories preserve the successful supersymmetric relation of gauge couplings, as they start out with equal SU(3) and SU(2) couplings and the correct initial sin^2\theta_W at the compactification scale of M_{GUT}\simeq 2x10^{16} GeV, and they have the minimal low-energy particle content of split supersymmetry. We also propose a mechanism in which the gauginos and higgsinos are further protected by a discrete R-symmetry against gravitational corrections, as the gravitino gets an invariant Dirac mass by pairing with a member of a Kaluza-Klein tower of spin-3/2 particles. In addition to the models proposed here, split supersymmetry offers novel strategies for realistic model-building. So, TeV-scale string models previously dismissed because of rapid proton decay, or incorrect sin^2\theta_W, or because there were no unused dimensions into which to dilute the strength of gravity, can now be reconsidered as candidates for realistic split theories with string scale near M_{GUT}, as long as the gauginos and higgsinos remain light.",0
"Boltzmann introduced in the 1870's a logarithmic measure for the connection between the thermodynamical entropy and the probabilities of the microscopic configurations of the system. His entropic functional for classical systems was extended by Gibbs to the entire phase space of a many-body system, and by von Neumann in order to cover quantum systems as well. Finally, it was used by Shannon within the theory of information. The simplest expression of this functional corresponds to a discrete set of $W$ microscopic possibilities, and is given by $S_{BG}= -k\sum_{i=1}^W p_i \ln p_i$ ($k$ is a positive universal constant; {\it BG} stands for {\it Boltzmann-Gibbs}). This relation enables the construction of BG statistical mechanics. The BG theory has provided uncountable important applications. Its application in physical systems is legitimate whenever the hypothesis of {\it ergodicity} is satisfied. However, {\it what can we do when ergodicity and similar simple hypotheses are violated?}, which indeed happens in very many natural, artificial and social complex systems. It was advanced in 1988 the possibility of generalizing BG statistical mechanics through a family of nonadditive entropies, namely $S_q=k\frac{1-\sum_{i=1}^W p_i^q}{q-1}$, which recovers the additive $S_{BG}$ entropy in the $q \to1$ limit. The index $q$ is to be determined from mechanical first principles. Along three decades, this idea intensively evolved world-wide (see Bibliography in \url{http://tsallis.cat.cbpf.br/biblio.htm}), and led to a plethora of predictions, verifications, and applications in physical systems and elsewhere. As expected whenever a {\it paradigm shift} is explored, some controversy naturally emerged as well in the community. The present status of the general picture is here described, starting from its dynamical and thermodynamical foundations, and ending with its most recent physical applications.",0
"Knowledge Graph (KG) contains entities and the relations between entities. Due to its representation ability, KG has been successfully applied to support many medical/healthcare tasks. However, in the medical domain, knowledge holds under certain conditions. For example, symptom \emph{runny nose} highly indicates the existence of disease \emph{whooping cough} when the patient is a baby rather than the people at other ages. Such conditions for medical knowledge are crucial for decision-making in various medical applications, which is missing in existing medical KGs. In this paper, we aim to discovery medical knowledge conditions from texts to enrich KGs. Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) are systematized collection of clinical data and contain detailed information about patients, thus EMRs can be a good resource to discover medical knowledge conditions. Unfortunately, the amount of available EMRs is limited due to reasons such as regularization. Meanwhile, a large amount of medical question answering (QA) data is available, which can greatly help the studied task. However, the quality of medical QA data is quite diverse, which may degrade the quality of the discovered medical knowledge conditions. In the light of these challenges, we propose a new truth discovery method, MedTruth, for medical knowledge condition discovery, which incorporates prior source quality information into the source reliability estimation procedure, and also utilizes the knowledge triple information for trustworthy information computation. We conduct series of experiments on real-world medical datasets to demonstrate that the proposed method can discover meaningful and accurate conditions for medical knowledge by leveraging both EMR and QA data. Further, the proposed method is tested on synthetic datasets to validate its effectiveness under various scenarios.",0
"We discuss our attempts to generalize the known examples of dualities in N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories to exceptional gauge groups. We derive some dual pairs from known examples connected to exceptional groups and find an interesting phenomenon: sometimes the full global symmetry is ``hidden'' on the magnetic side. It is not realized as a symmetry on the fundamental fields in the Lagrangian. Rather, it emerges as a symmetry of the quantum theory. We then focus on an approach based on self-dual models. We construct duals for some very special matter content of $E_ 7$, $E_6$ and $F_4$. Again we find that the full global symmetry is not realized on the fundamental fields.",0
We express the defining relations of the $q$-deformed Minkowski space algebra as well as that of the corresponding derivatives and differentials in the form of reflection equations. This formulation encompasses the covariance properties with respect the quantum Lorentz group action in a straightforward way.,0
"The digital nature of genes combined with the associated low copy numbers of proteins regulating them is a significant source of stochasticity, which affects the phase of biochemical oscillations. We provide a theoretical framework for understanding the dephasing evolution of genetic oscillations by combining the phenomenological stochastic limit cycle dynamics and the discrete Markov state models that describe the genetic oscillations. Through simulations of the realistic model of the NF\kappa B/I\kappa B network we illustrate the dephasing phenomena which are important for reconciling single cell and population based experiments on this system.",0
We discuss how confinement property of QCD results in the rational unitarization scheme and how unitarity saturation leads to appearance of a hadron liquid phase at very high temperatures.,0
"We have observed the continuum emission of the interacting galaxy NGC4631 at 0.87 and 1.23mm using the Heinrich-Hertz-Telescope on Mt. Graham and the IRAM 30-m telescope on Pico Veleta. We have obtained fully sampled maps which cover the optical emission out to a radius of about 7' at both wavelengths. For a detailed analysis, we carefully subtracted the line contributions and synchrotron and free-free emission from the data, which added up to 6% at 1.23mm and 10% at 0.87mm. We combined the flux densities with FIR data to obtain dust spectra and calculate dust temperatures, absorption cross sections, and masses. Assuming a ``standard'' dust model, which consists of two populations of big grains at moderate and warm temperatures, we obtained temperatures of 18K and 50K for the both components. However, such a model suffers from an excess of the radiation at 1.23mm, and the dust absorption cross section seems to be enhanced by a factor 3 compared to previous results and theoretical expectations. At large galactocentric radii, where the galaxy shows disturbances as a result of gravitational interaction, this effect seems to be even stronger. Some possibilities to resolve these problems are discussed. The data could be explained by a very cold dust component at a temperature of 4-6K, an increased abundance of very small grains, or a component of grains with unusual optical properties. We favour the latter possibility, since the first two lead to inconsistencies.",0
"We consider q-deformations of multiplicative hypertoric varieties, for q a non-zero element of an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0. We construct an algebra Dq of q-difference operators as a Heisenberg double in a braided monoidal category. We then focus on the case where q is specialized to a root of unity. In this setting, we use Dq to construct an Azumaya algebra on an l-twist of the multiplicative hypertoric variety, before showing that this algebra splits over the fibers of both the moment and resolution maps. Finally, we sketch a derived localization theorem for these Azumaya algebras.",0
"In this paper we at first consider plane trees with the root vertex and a marked directed edge, outgoing from the root vertex. For such trees we introduce a new characteristic --- the \emph{parity}, using the bracket code. It turns out that the parity depends only on the root vertex (not on the marked edge). And in the case of an even number of vertices the parity does not depend on the root vertex also. Then we consider rotation groups of bipartite trees, study their properties and prove that in the case of even number of vertices rotation groups of even and odd trees are different.",0
"We study the interplay of nematic and superconducting order in the two-dimensional Hubbard model and show that they can coexist, especially when superconductivity is not the energetically dominant phase. Due to a breaking of the $C_4$ symmetry, the coexisting phase inherently contains admixture of the $s$-wave pairing components. As a result, the superconducting gap exhibits very non-standard features including changed nodal directions. Our results also show that in the optimally doped regime the superconducting phase is typically unstable towards developing nematicity (breaking of the $C_4$ symmetry). This has implications for the cuprate high-$T_c$ superconductors, for which in this regime the so-called intertwined orders have recently been observed. Namely, the coexisting phase may be viewed as a precursor to such more involved patterns of symmetry breaking.",0
"We give an explicit description of the trace, or Hochschild homology, of the quantum Heisenberg category defined by Licata and Savage. We also show that as an algebra, it is isomorphic to """"half"""" of a central extension of the elliptic Hall algebra of Burban and Schiffmann, specialized at $\sigma = \bar\sigma^{-1} = q$. A key step in the proof may be of independent interest: we show that the sum (over $n$) of the Hochschild homologies of the positive affine Hecke algebras $\mathrm{AH}_n^+$ is again an algebra, and that this algebra injects into both the elliptic Hall algebra and the trace of the $q$-Heisenberg category. Finally, we show that a natural action of the trace algebra on the space of symmetric functions agrees with the specialization of an action constructed by Schiffmann and Vasserot using Hilbert schemes.",0
"Calculations of the reaction rate of the proton radiative capture on 3H at temperatures from 0.01 T9 up to 5 T9, which are based on the theoretical results for the astrophysical S-factor and take into account the latest experimental data, were carried out. Theoretical results for the S-factor at energies from 1 keV up to 5 MeV were obtained in the framework of the modified potential cluster model with the classification of orbital states according to Young tableaux. On the basis of used nuclear model of the interaction of p and 3H particles there was shown possibility of description the latest experimental data for the S-factor at the energy range from 50 keV up to 5 MeV.",0
We prove a support theorem for the radiation fields on asymptotically Euclidean manifolds with metrics which are warped products near infinity. It generalizes to this setting the well known support theorem for the Radon transform on n-dimensional Euclidean space.,0
"Sir James Jeans's (1902 and 1929) linear, acoustic, theory of gravitational instability gives vast errors for the structure formation of the early universe. Gibson's (1996) nonlinear theory shows that nonacoustic density extrema produced by turbulence are gravitationally unstable at turbulent, viscous, or diffusive Schwarz scales L_ST, L_SV, L_SD, independent of Jeans's acoustic scale L_J. Structure formation began with decelerations of 10^46 kg protosuperclusters in the hot plasma epoch, 13,000 years after the Big Bang, when L_SV decreased to the Hubble (horizon) scale L_H equiv ct, where c is light speed and t is time, giving 10^42 kg protogalaxies just before the cooled plasma formed neutral H-He gas at 300,000 years. In 10^3 years this primordial gas condensed to 10^23 - 10^25 kg L_SV - L_ST scale objects, termed ``primordial fog particles'' (PFPs). Schild (1996) suggested from continuous microlensing of quasar Q0957 + 561 A,B that the mass of the 10^42 kg lens galaxy is dominated by 10^23 - 10^25 kg ``rogue planets ... likely to be the missing mass''. A microlensing event seen at three observatories confirms Schild's (1996) claims, and supports Gibson's (1996) prediction that PFPs comprise most of the dark matter at galactic scales.",0
"In a sequence of four papers, we prove the following results (via a unified approach) for all sufficiently large $n$: (i) [1-factorization conjecture] Suppose that $n$ is even and $D \geq 2\lceil n/4\rceil -1$. Then every $D$-regular graph $G$ on $n$ vertices has a decomposition into perfect matchings. Equivalently, $\chi'(G)=D$. (ii) [Hamilton decomposition conjecture] Suppose that $D \ge \lfloor n/2 \rfloor $. Then every $D$-regular graph $G$ on $n$ vertices has a decomposition into Hamilton cycles and at most one perfect matching. (iii) [Optimal packings of Hamilton cycles] Suppose that $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices with minimum degree $\delta\ge n/2$. Then $G$ contains at least ${\rm reg}_{\rm even}(n,\delta)/2 \ge (n-2)/8$ edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles. Here ${\rm reg}_{\rm even}(n,\delta)$ denotes the degree of the largest even-regular spanning subgraph one can guarantee in a graph on $n$ vertices with minimum degree $\delta$. According to Dirac, (i) was first raised in the 1950s. (ii) and the special case $\delta= \lceil n/2 \rceil$ of (iii) answer questions of Nash-Williams from 1970. All of the above bounds are best possible. In the current paper, we prove the above results for the case when $G$ is close to a complete balanced bipartite graph.",0
"The Debye mass m_D is computed nonperturbatively in the deconfined phase of QCD, where chromomagnetic confinement is known to be present. The latter defines m_D to be m_D=c_D\sqrt{\sigma_s}, where c_D \cong 2.06 and \sigma_s=\sigma_s(T) is the spatial string tension. The resulting magnitude of m_D(T) and temperature dependence are in good agreement with lattice calculations. Background perturbation theory expansion for m_D(T) is discussed in comparison to standard perturbative results and recent gauge-invariant definitions.",0
"The intrinsic multivaluedness of interaction process, revealed in Part I of this series of papers, is interpreted as the origin of the true dynamical (in particular, quantum) chaos. The latter is causally deduced as unceasing series of transitions, dynamically probabilistic by their origin, between the equally real, but incompatible 'realisations' (modes of interaction) of a system. The obtained set of realisations form the causally derived, intrinsically complete """"space of events"""" providing the crucial extension of the notion of probability and the method of its first-principle calculation. The fundamental dynamic uncertainty thus revealed is specified for Hamiltonian quantum systems and applied to quantum chaos description in periodically perturbed systems. The ordinary semiclassical transition in our quantum-mechanical results leads to exact reproduction of the main features of chaotic behaviour of the system known from classical mechanics, which permits one to """"re-establish"""" the correspondence principle for chaotic systems (inevitably lost in any their conventional, single-valued description). The causal dynamical randomness in the extended quantum mechanics is not restricted, however, to semiclassical conditions and generically occurs also in essentially quantum regimes, even though partial """"quantum suppression of chaos"""" does exist and is specified in our description, as well as other particular types of the quantum (truly) chaotic behaviour.",0
"We present a generalize Landauer-B\""""uttiker transport theory for multi-terminal spin transport in presence of spin-orbit interaction. It is pointed out that the presence of spin-orbit interaction results in {\it equilibrium spin currents}, since in presence of spin-orbit interaction spin is not a conserved quantitative. Further we illustrate the theory by applying it to a three terminal Y-shaped conductor. It is shown that when one of the terminal is a potential probe, there exist {\it nonequilibrium pure spin currents} without a n accompanying charge current. It is shown that this pure spin currents causes a voltage drop which can be measured if the potential probe is ferromagnetic.",0
We study numerically and analytically the dynamics of defect formation during a finite-time quench of the two dimensional Swift-Hohenberg (SH) model of Rayleigh-Benard convection. We find that the Kibble-Zurek picture of defect formation can be applied to describe the density of defects produced during the quench. Our study reveals the relevance of two factors: the effect of local variations of the striped patterns within defect-free domains and the presence of both point-like and extended defects. Taking into account these two aspects we are able to identify the characteristic length scale selected during the quench and to relate it to the density of defects. We discuss possible consequences of our study for the analysis of the coarsening process of the SH model.,0
In this paper we find a unique normal form for the symplectic matrix representation of the conjugacy class of a prime order element of the mapping-class group. We find a set of generators for the fundamental group of a surface with a conformal automorphism of prime order which reflects the action the automorphism in an optimal way. This is called an {\sl adapted} homotopy basis and there is a corresponding {\sl adapted presentation}. We also give a necessary and sufficient condition for a prime order symplectic matrix to be the image of a prime order element in the mapping-class group.,0
"Calculations are presented of the longitudinal structure function $F_L(x, Q^2)$. We use next-to-leading order expressions in QCD $({\cal{O}}(\alpha_s^2))$ plus parton densities determined previously from global fits to data on deep inelastic lepton scattering, prompt photon production, and bottom quark production. Anticipated data from the DESY ep collider HERA should provide discriminating information on the gluon density, particularly for values of $x < 0.05$.",0
"Experimental results and their interpretations are presented on the nonlinear acoustic effects of multiple scattered elastic waves in unconsolidated granular media. Short wave packets with a central frequency higher than the so-called cut-off frequency of the medium are emitted at one side of the statically stressed slab of glass beads and received at the other side after multiple scattering and nonlinear interactions. Typical signals are strongly distorted compared to their initially radiated shape both due to nonlinearity and scattering. It is shown that acoustic waves with a deformation amplitude much lower than the mean static deformation of the contacts in the medium can modify the elastic properties of the medium, especially for the weak contact skeleton part. This addresses the problem of reproducibility of granular structures during and after acoustic excitation, which is necessary to understand in the non destructive testing of the elastic properties of granular media by acoustic methods. Coda signal analysis is shown to be a powerful time-resolved tool to monitor slight modifications in the elastic response of an unconsolidated granular structure.",0
"We analyse an initial-boundary value problem for the mKdV equation on a finite interval by expressing the solution in terms of the solution of an associated matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem in the complex $k$-plane. This Riemann-Hilbert problem has explicit $(x,t)$-dependence and it involves certain functions of $k$ referred to as ``spectral functions''. Some of these functions are defined in terms of the initial condition $q(x,0)=q_0(x)$, while the remaining spectral functions are defined in terms of two sets of boundary values. We show that the spectral functions satisfy an algebraic ``global relation'' that characterize the boundary values in spectral terms.",0
"We compute the spectral action of $SU(2)/\Gamma$ with the trivial spin structure and the round metric and find it in each case to be equal to $\frac{1}{|\Gamma|} (\Lambda^3 \hat{f}^{(2)}(0) - 1/4\Lambda \hat{f}(0))+ O(\Lambda^{-\infty})$. We do this by explicitly computing the spectrum of the Dirac operator for $SU(2)/\Gamma$ equipped with the trivial spin structure and a selection of metrics. Here $\Gamma$ is a finite subgroup of SU(2). In the case where $\Gamma$ is cyclic, or dicyclic, we consider the one-parameter family of Berger metrics, which includes the round metric, and when $\Gamma$ is the binary tetrahedral, binary octahedral or binary icosahedral group, we only consider the case of the round metric.",0
"In this paper we show how certain techniques of image processing, having different scopes, can be joined together under a common """"algebraic roof"""".",0
"In recent work, the author and others have studied compositional algebras of Petri nets. Here we consider mathematical aspects of the pure linking algebras that underly them. We characterise composition of nets without places as the composition of spans over appropriate categories of relations, and study the underlying algebraic structures.",0
"We use extensive DMRG calculations to show that a classification of SU(n) spin chains with regard to the existence of spinon confinement and hence a Haldane gap obtained previously for valence bond solid models applies to SU(n) Heisenberg chains as well. In particular, we observe spinon confinement due to a next-nearest neighbor interaction in the SU(4) representation 10 spin chain.",0
We study the four-terminal resistance fluctuations of mesoscopic samples near the transition between the $\nu=2$ and the $\nu=1$ quantum Hall states. We observe near-perfect correlations between the fluctuations of the longitudinal and Hall components of the resistance. These correlated fluctuations appear in a magnetic-field range for which the two-terminal resistance of the samples is quantized. We discuss these findings in light of edge-state transport models of the quantum Hall effect. We also show that our results lead to an ambiguity in the determination of the width of quantum Hall transitions.,0
"In this paper, we review the issue of defining energy for test particles on a background stationary spacetime. We revisit the different notions of energy as defined by different observers. As is well known, the existence of a time-like isometry allows for the notion of total conserved energy to be well defined. We use this well known quantity to show that a gravitational potential energy can be consistently defined. As examples, we study the case of the exterior regions of an asymptotically flat black hole and of the $\Lambda>0$ Schwarzschild de Sitter case, where an asymptotic region is not available. We then consider the situation in which the test particle is absorbed by the black hole, and analyze the energetics in detail. In particular, we show that the notion of horizon energy as defined by the isolated horizons formalism provides a satisfactory notion of energy compatible with the particle's total conserved energy. With these choices, there is a global conservation of energy. Finally, we comment on a recent proposal to define energy of the black hole as seen by a nearby observer at rest, for which this feature is lost.",0
"Neural networks have proven to be extremely powerful tools for modern artificial intelligence applications, but computational and storage complexity remain limiting factors. This paper presents two compatible contributions towards reducing the time, energy, computational, and storage complexities associated with multilayer perceptrons. Pre-defined sparsity is proposed to reduce the complexity during both training and inference, regardless of the implementation platform. Our results show that storage and computational complexity can be reduced by factors greater than 5X without significant performance loss. The second contribution is an architecture for hardware acceleration that is compatible with pre-defined sparsity. This architecture supports both training and inference modes and is flexible in the sense that it is not tied to a specific number of neurons. For example, this flexibility implies that various sized neural networks can be supported on various sized Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)s.",0
"We introduce a simple computational model that, with a microscopic dynamics driven by natural selection and mutation alone, allows the description of true speciation events. A statistical analysis of the so generated evolutionary tree captures realistic features showing power laws for frequency distributions in time and size. Albeit these successful predictions, the difficulty in obtaining punctuated dynamics with mass extinctions suggests the necessity of decoupling micro and macro-evolutionary mechanisms in agreement with some ideas of Gould's and Eldredge's theory of punctuated equilibrium.",0
"In order to describe the exotic nuclear structure in unstable odd-$A$ or odd-odd nuclei, the deformed relativistic Hartree Bogoliubov theory in continuum has been extended to incorporate the blocking effect due to the odd nucleon. For a microscopic and self-consistent description of pairing correlations, continuum, deformation, blocking effects, and the extended spatial density distribution in exotic nuclei, the deformed relativistic Hartree Bogoliubov equations are solved in a Woods-Saxon basis in which the radial wave functions have a proper asymptotic behavior at large $r$. The formalism and numerical details are provided. The code is checked by comparing the results with those of spherical relativistic continuum Hartree Bogoliubov theory in the nucleus $^{19}$O. The prolate deformed nucleus $^{15}$C is studied by examining the neutron levels and density distributions.",0
"Bio-signals exhibit high redundancy, and the algorithms for their processing are inherently error resilient. This property can be leveraged to improve the energy-efficiency of IoT-Edge (wearables) through the emerging trend of approximate computing. This paper presents XBioSiP, a novel methodology for approximate bio-signal processing that employs two quality evaluation stages, during the pre-processing and bio-signal processing stages, to determine the approximation parameters. It thereby achieves high energy savings while satisfying the user-determined quality constraint. Our methodology achieves, up to 19x and 22x reduction in the energy consumption of a QRS peak detection algorithm for 0% and <1% loss in peak detection accuracy, respectively.",0
"We use orbit based dynamical models to fit the 2nd and 4th moments of the line of sight velocity distributions of the Fornax, Sculptor, Carina and Sextans dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Our goal is to compare dark matter profile models of these four systems using Bayesian evidence. We consider NFW, Einasto and several cored profiles for their dark halos and present the probability distribution functions of the model parameters. When considering each system separately, we find there is no preference for one of these specific parametric density profiles. However, the combined evidence shows that it is unlikely that all galaxies are embedded in the same type of cored profiles of the form \rho_{DM} \propto 1/(1 + r^2)^{\beta/2}, where \beta = 3, 4. For each galaxy, we also obtain an almost model independent, and therefore accurate, measurement of the logarithmic slope of the dark matter density distribution at a radius ~ r_{-3}, i.e. where the logarithmic slope of the stellar density profile is -3. This slope ranges from ~ -1.4 for Fornax to ~ -1.1 for Sextans, both at ~ 1 kpc. All our best fit models essentially have the same mass distribution over a large range in radius (from just below r_{-3} to the last measured data point). This remarkable finding likely implies much stronger constraints on the characteristics that subhalos extracted from cosmological simulations should have in order to host the dSph galaxies around the Milky Way.",0
"We study the current of Bose particles between two reservoirs connected by a one-dimensional channel. We analyze the problem from first principles by considering a microscopic model of conductivity in the noninteracting limit. Equations for the transient and the stationary current are derived analytically. The asymptotic current has a form similar to the Landauer-B\""""uttiker equation for electronic current in mesoscopic devices.",0
"In this paper, we present a numerical solution to an ordinary differential equation of a fractional order in one-dimensional space. The solution to this equation can describe a steady state of the process of anomalous diffusion. The process arises from interactions within complex and non-homogeneous background. We present a numerical method which is based on the finite differences method. We consider a boundary value problem (Dirichlet conditions) for an equation with the Riesz-Feller fractional derivative. In the final part of this paper, same simulation results are shown. We present an example of non-linear temperature profiles in nanotubes which can be approximated by a solution to the fractional differential equation.",0
The temperature and gate voltage dependences of the phase breaking time are studied experimentally in GaAs/InGaAs heterostructures with single quantum well. It is shown that appearance of states at the Fermi energy in the doped layers leads to a significant decrease of the phase breaking time of the carriers in quantum well and to saturation of the phase breaking time at low temperature.,0
"We have developed an Internet-based audience response system (called ARSBO). In this way we combine the advantages of common audience response systems using handheld devices and the easy and cheap access to the Internet. Evaluations of audience response systems in the literature have shown their success: encouraging participation of the students as well as immediate feedback to answers to the whole group for evaluational purposes of the teacher. However, commercial systems are relatively expensive and the number of students in such a teaching-learning scenario is limited. ARSBO solves these problems. Using the Internet (e.g. in computer rooms or by wireless Internet access) there are no special costs and the number of participating students is not limited. ARSBO is very easy to use for students as well as for the construction of new questions with possible answers and for the visualization of statistical results to questions.",0
"We study B0->rho0rho0 decays in a sample of 465*10^6 Upsilon (4S)->BBbar events collected with the BABAR detector at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy e+e- collider located at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). We measure the branching fraction B = (0.92 +/- 0.32 +/- 0.14)*10^{-6} and longitudinal polarization fraction f_L = 0.75^{+0.11}_{-0.14} +/- 0.04, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. The evidence for the B0->rho0rho0 signal has a significance of 3.1 standard deviations, including systematic uncertainties. We investigate the proper-time dependence of the longitudinal component in the decay and measure the CP-violating coefficients S^{00}_L = (0.3 +/- 0.7 +/- 0.2) and C^{00}_L = (0.2 +/- 0.8 +/- 0.3). We study the implication of these results for the unitarity triangle angle alpha.",0
"A new Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) algorithm for Bayesian updating of model parameters is proposed in this paper, which combines the ABC principles with the technique of Subset Simulation for efficient rare-event simulation, first developed in S.K. Au and J.L. Beck [1]. It has been named ABC- SubSim. The idea is to choose the nested decreasing sequence of regions in Subset Simulation as the regions that correspond to increasingly closer approximations of the actual data vector in observation space. The efficiency of the algorithm is demonstrated in two examples that illustrate some of the challenges faced in real-world applications of ABC. We show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other recent sequential ABC algorithms in terms of computational efficiency while achieving the same, or better, measure of ac- curacy in the posterior distribution. We also show that ABC-SubSim readily provides an estimate of the evidence (marginal likelihood) for posterior model class assessment, as a by-product.",0
"Massive parallelisation has lead to a dramatic increase in available computational power. However, data transfer speeds have failed to keep pace and are the major limiting factor in the development of exascale computing. New algorithms must be developed which minimise the transfer of data. Patch dynamics is a computational macroscale modelling scheme which provides a coarse macroscale solution of a problem defined on a fine microscale by dividing the domain into many nonoverlapping, coupled patches. Patch dynamics is readily adaptable to massive parallelisation as each processor can evaluate the dynamics on one, or a few, patches. However, patch coupling conditions interpolate across the unevaluated parts of the domain between patches, and are typically reevaluated at every microscale time step, thus requiring almost continuous data transfer. We propose a modified patch dynamics scheme which minimises data transfer by only reevaluating the patch coupling conditions at `mesoscale' time scales which are significantly larger than the microscale time of the microscale problem. We analyse the error arising from patch dynamics with mesoscale temporal coupling as a function of the mesoscale time interval, patch size, and ratio between the microscale and macroscale.",0
"In this paper, channel estimation for millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with one-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) is considered. In the mmWave band, the number of propagation paths is small, which results in sparse virtual channels. To estimate sparse virtual channels based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion, sparsity-constrained optimization comes into play. In general, optimizing objective functions with sparsity constraints is NP-hard because of their combinatorial complexity. Furthermore, the coarse quantization of one-bit ADCs makes channel estimation a challenging task. In the field of compressed sensing (CS), the gradient support pursuit (GraSP) and gradient hard thresholding pursuit (GraHTP) algorithms were proposed to approximately solve sparsity-constrained optimization problems iteratively by pursuing the gradient of the objective function via hard thresholding. The accuracy guarantee of these algorithms, however, breaks down when the objective function is ill-conditioned, which frequently occurs in the mmWave band. To prevent the breakdown of gradient pursuit-based algorithms, the band maximum selecting (BMS) technique, which is a hard thresholder selecting only the """"band maxima,"""" is applied to GraSP and GraHTP to propose the BMSGraSP and BMSGraHTP algorithms in this paper.",0
"Over the recent years the importance of numerical experiments has gradually been more recognized. Nonetheless, sufficient documentation of how computational results have been obtained is often not available. Especially in the scientific computing and applied mathematics domain this is crucial, since numerical experiments are usually employed to verify the proposed hypothesis in a publication. This work aims to propose standards and best practices for the setup and publication of numerical experiments. Naturally, this amounts to a guideline for development, maintenance, and publication of numerical research software. Such a primer will enable the replicability and reproducibility of computer-based experiments and published results and also promote the reusability of the associated software.",0
"We prove the following theorem about relative entropy of quantum states. """"Substate theorem: Let rho and sigma be quantum states in the same Hilbert space with relative entropy S(rho|sigma) = Tr rho (log rho - log sigma) = c. Then for all epsilon > 0, there is a state rho' such that the trace distance ||rho' - rho||_t = Tr sqrt{(rho' - rho)^2} <= epsilon, and rho'/2^{O(c/epsilon^2)} <= sigma."""" It states that if the relative entropy of rho and sigma is small, then there is a state rho' close to rho, i.e. with small trace distance ||rho' - rho||_t, that when scaled down by a factor 2^{O(c)} `sits inside', or becomes a `substate' of, sigma. This result has several applications in quantum communication complexity and cryptography. Using the substate theorem, we derive a privacy trade-off for the set membership problem in the two-party quantum communication model. Here Alice is given a subset A of [n], Bob an input i in [n], and they need to determine if i in A. """"Privacy trade-off for set membership: In any two-party quantum communication protocol for the set membership problem, if Bob reveals only k bits of information about his input, then Alice must reveal at least n/2^{O(k)} bits of information about her input."""" We also discuss relationships between various information theoretic quantities that arise naturally in the context of the substate theorem.",0
We discuss renormalization group equations (RGE) for the parameters of the Higgs sector in general Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM). We present the three-loop results but consider only contributions due to self-couplings of the Higgs doublets. We study the structure of RGE and express beta-functions in terms of reparametrization invariants with respect to higgs-basis rotations. The Cayley-Hamilton theorem is utilized to reduce both the number of independent tensor structures in matrix RGE and the number of invariants to a minimal set. As a by-product of our calculation we discovered that two-loop RGE of the scalar sector in general QFT with multiple higgses were not properly implemented in a number of public packages. The latter give rise to a wrong result when mixing in the scalar sector is allowed.,0
In this work we study the homogenization problem for nonlinear eigenvalues of quasilinear elliptic operators. We obtain an explicit order of convergence in $k$ and in $\varepsilon$ for the (variational) eigenvalues.,0

"The observable universe could be a 1+3-surface (the """"brane"""") embedded in a 1+3+d-dimensional spacetime (the """"bulk""""), with standard-model particles and fields trapped on the brane while gravity is free to access the bulk. At least one of the d extra spatial dimensions could be very large relative to the Planck scale, which lowers the fundamental gravity scale, possibly even down to the electroweak (~ TeV) level. This revolutionary picture arises in the framework of recent developments in M theory. The 1+10-dimensional M theory encompasses the known 1+9-dimensional superstring theories, and is widely considered to be a promising potential route to quantum gravity. General relativity cannot describe gravity at high enough energies and must be replaced by a quantum gravity theory, picking up significant corrections as the fundamental energy scale is approached. At low energies, gravity is localized at the brane and general relativity is recovered, but at high energies gravity """"leaks"""" into the bulk, behaving in a truly 1+3+d-dimensional way. This introduces significant changes to gravitational dynamics and perturbations, with interesting testable implications for high-energy astrophysics, black holes and cosmology. Brane-world models offer a phenomenological way to test some of the novel predictions and corrections to general relativity that are implied by M theory. This review discusses the geometry, dynamics and perturbations of simple brane-world models for cosmology and astrophysics, mainly focusing on warped 5-dimensional brane-worlds based on the Randall-Sundrum models.",0

"Creating user defined functions (UDFs) is a powerful method to improve the quality of computer applications, in particular spreadsheets. However, the only direct way to use UDFs in spreadsheets is to switch from the functional and declarative style of spreadsheet formulas to the imperative VBA, which creates a high entry barrier even for proficient spreadsheet users. It has been proposed to extend Excel by UDFs declared by a spreadsheet: user defined spreadsheet functions (UDSFs). In this paper we present a method to create a limited form of UDSFs in Excel without any use of VBA. Calls to those UDSFs utilize what-if data tables to execute the same part of a worksheet several times, thus turning it into a reusable function definition.",0
"We propose an $SO(10)$ supersymmetric grand unified theory (SUSY GUT), where the $SO(10)$ gauge symmetry breaks down to $SU(3)_c \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y\times U(1)_{X}$ at the GUT scale and $U(1)_X$ is radiatively broken at the SUSY-braking scale. In order to achieve the observed Higgs mass around $126$ GeV and also to satisfy constraints on flavor- and/or CP-violating processes, we assume that the SUSY-breaking scale is $O(100)$ TeV, so that the $U(1)_X$ breaking scale is also $O(100)$ TeV. One big issue in the SO(10) GUTs is how to realize realistic Yukawa couplings. In our model, not only ${\bf 16}$-dimensional but also ${\bf 10}$-dimensional matter fields are introduced to predict the observed fermion masses and mixings. The Standard-Model quarks and leptons are linear combinations of the ${\bf 16}$- and ${\bf 10}$-dimensional fields so that the $U(1)_{X}$ gauge interaction may be flavor-violating. We investigate the current constraints on the flavor-violating $Z'$ interaction from the flavor physics and discuss prospects for future experiments.",0
"This work originates from a first year undergraduate research project on hidden symmetries of the dynamics for classical Hamiltonian systems, under the program 'Jovens talentos para a Ciencia' of Brazilian funding agency Capes. For pedagogical reasons the main subject chosen was Kepler's problem of motion under a central potential, since it is a completely solved system. It is well known that for this problem the group of dynamical symmetries is strictly larger than the isometry group O(3), the extra symmetries corresponding to hidden symmetries of the dynamics. By taking the point of view of examining the group action of the dynamical symmetries on the allowed trajectories, it is possible to teach in the same project basic elements of as many important subjects in physics as: Hamiltonian formalism, hidden symmetries, integrable systems, group theory, and the use of manifolds.",0
"Wormhole boundary conditions for the Wheeler--DeWitt equation can be derived from the path integral formulation. It is proposed that the wormhole wave function must be square integrable in the maximal analytic extension of minisuperspace. Quantum wormholes can be invested with a Hilbert space structure, the inner product being naturally induced by the minisuperspace metric, in which the Wheeler--DeWitt operator is essentially self--adjoint. This provides us with a kind of probabilistic interpretation. In particular, giant wormholes will give extremely small contributions to any wormhole state. We also study the whole spectrum of the Wheeler--DeWitt operator and its role in the calculation of Green's functions and effective low energy interactions.",0
"We show that four-dimensional black holes become stable below certain mass when the Einstein-Hilbert action is supplemented with higher-curvature terms. We prove this to be the case for an infinite family of ghost-free theories involving terms of arbitrarily high order in curvature. The new black holes, which are non-hairy generalizations of Schwarzschild's solution, present a universal thermodynamic behavior for general values of the higher-order couplings. In particular, small black holes have infinite lifetimes. When the evaporation process makes the semiclassical approximation break down (something that occurs after a time which is usually infinite for all practical purposes), the resulting object retains a huge entropy, in stark contrast with Schwarzschild's case.",0
"In this paper we provide a valuation formula for different classes of actuarial and financial contracts which depend on a general loss process, by using the Malliavin calculus. In analogy with the celebrated Black-Scholes formula, we aim at expressing the expected cash flow in terms of a building block. The former is related to the loss process which is a cumulated sum indexed by a doubly stochastic Poisson process of claims allowed to be dependent on the intensity and the jump times of the counting process. For example, in the context of Stop-Loss contracts the building block is given by the distribution function of the terminal cumulated loss, taken at the Value at Risk when computing the Expected Shortfall risk measure.",0
We show that a class of topological field theories are quantum duals of the harmonic oscillator. This is demonstrated by establishing a correspondence between the creation and annihilation operators and non-local gauge invariant observables of the topological field theory. The example is used to discuss some issues concerning background independence and the relation of vacuum energy to the problem of time in quantum gravity.,0
The decay $\tau^{-}\to K^{-}K_S\nu_{\tau}$ has been studied using $430\times10^6$ $e^+e^-\to \tau^+\tau^-$ events produced at a center-of-mass energy around 10.6 GeV at the PEP-II collider and studied with the BABAR detector. The mass spectrum of the $K^{-}K_S$ system has been measured and the spectral function has been obtained. The measured branching fraction ${\cal B}(\tau^{-}\to K^{-}K_S\nu_{\tau}) = (0.739\pm 0.011(\rm stat.)\pm 0.020(\rm syst.))\times 10^{-3}$ is found to be in agreement with earlier measurements.,0
"We address the dynamics of nonclassicality for a quantum system interacting with a noisy fluctuating environment described by a classical stochastic field. As a paradigmatic example, we consider a harmonic oscillator initially prepared in a maximally nonclassical state, e.g. a Fock number state or a Schroedinger cat-like state, and then coupled to either resonant or non-resonant external field. Stochastic modeling allows us to describe the decoherence dynamics without resorting to approximated quantum master equations, and to introduce non- Markovian effects in a controlled way. A detailed comparison among different nonclassicality criteria and a thorough analysis of the decoherence time reveal a rich phenomenology whose main features may be summarized as follows: i) classical memory effects increase the survival time of quantum coherence; ii) a detuning between the natural frequency of the system and the central frequency of the classical field induces revivals of quantum coherence.",0
"K-Nearest neighbor classifier (k-NNC) is simple to use and has little design time like finding k values in k-nearest neighbor classifier, hence these are suitable to work with dynamically varying data-sets. There exists some fundamental improvements over the basic k-NNC, like weighted k-nearest neighbors classifier (where weights to nearest neighbors are given based on linear interpolation), using artificially generated training set called bootstrapped training set, etc. These improvements are orthogonal to space reduction and classification time reduction techniques, hence can be coupled with any of them. The paper proposes another improvement to the basic k-NNC where the weights to nearest neighbors are given based on Gaussian distribution (instead of linear interpolation as done in weighted k-NNC) which is also independent of any space reduction and classification time reduction technique. We formally show that our proposed method is closely related to non-parametric density estimation using a Gaussian kernel. We experimentally demonstrate using various standard data-sets that the proposed method is better than the existing ones in most cases.",0
"The 22 GHz H2O maser in Orion KL has shown extraordinary burst events in 1979-1985 and 1998-1999, sometimes called supermaser. We have conducted monitoring observations of the supermaser in Orion KL using VERA, VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry, in the current third burst since 2011 March. Three flux maxima are detected in 2011 and 2012 with rising and falling timescales of 2-7 months. Time variations of the supermaser seem symmetric for all of the active phases. The maximum total flux density of 135000 Jy is observed in 2012 June while it is still one order of magnitude lower than those in previous bursts. The supermaser consists of two spatially different components at different velocities. They are elongated along a northwest-southeast direction perpendicular to the low-velocity outflow driven by Source I. Proper motions of the supermaser features with respect to Source I are measured toward west and southwest directions, almost parallel to the low-velocity outflow. The flux density and linewidth show an anti-correlation as expected for an unsaturated maser emission. The supermaser is located close to the methylformate (HCOOCH3) line and continuum emission peaks in the Orion Compact Ridge detected by ALMA. The broader velocity range of the weak HCOOCH3 emission at the supermaser position would be an evidence of a shock front. On the other hand, the 321 GHz H2O line is not detected at the position of the supermaser. It can be explained qualitatively by one of the theoretical H2O excitation models without extraordinary conditions. Our results support a scenario that the supermaser is excited in the dense gas interacting with the low-velocity outflow in the Compact Ridge. The extremely high flux density and its symmetric time variation for rising and falling phases could be explained by a beaming effect during the amplification process rather than changes in physical conditions.",0

The wave function of a spheroidal harmonic oscillator without spin-orbit interaction is expressed in terms of associated Laguerre and Hermite polynomials. The pairing gap and Fermi energy are found by solving the BCS system of two equations. Analytical relationships for the matrix elements of inertia are obtained function of the main quantum numbers and potential derivative. They may be used to test complex computer codes one should develop in a realistic approach of the fission dynamics. The results given for the $^{240}$Pu nucleus are compared with a hydrodynamical model. The importance of taking into account the correction term due to the variation of the occupation number is stressed.,0
"In this submission I report work in progress on learning simplified interpreted languages by means of recurrent models. The data is constructed to reflect core properties of natural language as modeled in formal syntax and semantics: recursive syntactic structure and compositionality.

"We examine the problem of computing multivariate scenarios sets for skewed distributions. Our interest is motivated by the potential use of such sets in the """"stress testing"""" of insurance companies and banks whose solvency is dependent on changes in a set of financial """"risk factors"""". We define multivariate scenario sets based on the notion of half-space depth (HD) and also introduce the notion of expectile depth (ED) where half-spaces are defined by expectiles rather than quantiles. We then use the HD and ED functions to define convex scenario sets that generalize the concepts of quantile and expectile to higher dimensions. In the case of elliptical distributions these sets coincide with the regions encompassed by the contours of the density function. In the context of multivariate skewed distributions, the equivalence of depth contours and density contours does not hold in general. We consider two parametric families that account for skewness and heavy tails: the generalized hyperbolic and the skew-t distributions. By making use of a canonical form representation, where skewness is completely absorbed by one component, we show that the HD contours of these distributions are """"near-elliptical"""" and, in the case of the skew-Cauchy distribution, we prove that the HD contours are exactly elliptical. We propose a measure of multivariate skewness as a deviation from angular symmetry and show that it can explain the quality of the elliptical approximation for the HD contours.",0
"We consider the problem of estimating the arithmetic average of a finite collection of real vectors stored in a distributed fashion across several compute nodes subject to a communication budget constraint. Our analysis does not rely on any statistical assumptions about the source of the vectors. This problem arises as a subproblem in many applications, including reduce-all operations within algorithms for distributed and federated optimization and learning. We propose a flexible family of randomized algorithms exploring the trade-off between expected communication cost and estimation error. Our family contains the full-communication and zero-error method on one extreme, and an $\epsilon$-bit communication and ${\cal O}\left(1/(\epsilon n)\right)$ error method on the opposite extreme. In the special case where we communicate, in expectation, a single bit per coordinate of each vector, we improve upon existing results by obtaining $\mathcal{O}(r/n)$ error, where $r$ is the number of bits used to represent a floating point value.",0
"Quasi free-standing monolayer graphene can be produced by intercalating species like oxygen or hydrogen between epitaxial graphene and the substrate crystal. If the graphene is indeed decoupled from the substrate, one would expect the observation of a similar electronic dispersion and many-body effects, irrespective of the substrate and the material used to achieve the decoupling. Here we investigate the electron-phonon coupling in two different types of quasi free-standing monolayer graphene: decoupled from SiC via hydrogen intercalation and decoupled from Ir via oxygen intercalation. Both systems show a similar overall behaviour of the self-energy and a weak renormalization of the bands near the Fermi energy. The electron-phonon coupling is found to be sufficiently weak to make the precise determination of the coupling constant lambda through renormalization difficult. The estimated value of lambda is 0.05(3) for both systems.",0
"We study top quark flavor violation in the framework of a warped extra dimension with the Standard Model (SM) fields propagating in the bulk. Such a scenario provides solutions to both the Planck-weak hierarchy problem and the flavor puzzle of the SM without inducing a flavor problem. We find that, generically, tcZ couplings receive a huge enhancement, in particular the right handed ones can be O(1%). This results in BR(t -> c Z) at or above the sensitivity of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). At the International Linear Collider (ILC), single top production, via e^+ e^- -> t \bar c, can be a striking signal for this scenario. In particular, it represents a physics topic of critical importance that can be explored even with a relatively low energy option, close to the tc threshold. At both the LHC and the ILC, angular distributions can probe the above prediction of dominance of right-handed couplings.",0
"The main purpose of this article is to survey on some key elements of a recent $\mathcal{H}_p$-theory of general Dirichlet series $\sum a_n e^{-\lambda_{n}s}$, which was mainly inspired by the work of Bayart and Helson on ordinary Dirichlet series $\sum a_n n^{-s}$. In view of an ingenious identification of Bohr, the $\mathcal{H}_p$-theory of ordinary Dirichlet series can be seen as a sub-theory of Fourier analysis on the infinite dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^\infty$. Extending these ideas, the $\mathcal{H}_p$-theory of $\lambda$-Dirichlet series is build as a sub-theory of Fourier analysis on what we call $\lambda$-Dirichlet groups. A number of problems is added.",0
"In some fields such as Mathematics Mechanization, automated reasoning and Trustworthy Computing etc., exact results are needed. Symbolic computations are used to obtain the exact results.

In this paper, we study how to obtain exact interpolation polynomial with rational coefficients by approximate interpolating methods.",0
"The fourth harmonic of the azimuthal distribution of particles $v_4$ has been measured for Au-Au collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The centrality dependence of $v_4$ does not agree with the prediction from hydrodynamics. In particular, the ratio $v_4/(v_2)^2$, where $v_2$ denotes the second harmonic of the azimuthal distribution of particles, is significantly larger than predicted by hydrodynamics. We argue that this discrepancy is mostly due to elliptic flow ($v_2$) fluctuations. We evaluate these fluctuations on the basis of a Monte Carlo Glauber calculation. The effect of deviations from local thermal equilibrium is also studied, but appears to be only a small correction. Combining these two effects allows us to reproduce experimental data for peripheral and midcentral collisions. However, we are unable to explain the large magnitude of $v_4/(v_2)^2$ observed for the most central collisions.",0
"Now a days, data mining and knowledge discovery methods are applied to a variety of enterprise and engineering disciplines to uncover interesting patterns from databases. The study of Sequential patterns is an important data mining problem due to its wide applications to real world time dependent databases. Sequential patterns are inter-event patterns ordered over a time-period associated with specific objects under study. Analysis and discovery of frequent sequential patterns over a predetermined time-period are interesting data mining results, and can aid in decision support in many enterprise applications. The problem of sequential pattern mining poses computational challenges as a long frequent sequence contains enormous number of frequent subsequences. Also useful results depend on the right choice of event window. In this paper, we have studied the problem of sequential pattern mining through two perspectives, one the computational aspect of the problem and the other is incorporation and adjustability of time constraint. We have used Indiscernibility relation from theory of rough sets to partition the search space of sequential patterns and have proposed a novel algorithm that allows previsualization of patterns and allows adjustment of time constraint prior to execution of mining task. The algorithm Rough Set Partitioning is at least ten times faster than the naive time constraint based sequential pattern mining algorithm GSP. Besides this an additional knowledge of time interval of sequential patterns is also determined with the method.",0

"In this paper, we present the preliminary optical design of PANIC (PAnoramic Near Infrared camera for Calar Alto), a wide-field infrared imager for the Calar Alto 2.2 m telescope. The camera optical design is a folded single optical train that images the sky onto the focal plane with a plate scale of 0.45 arcsec per 18 micron pixel. A mosaic of four Hawaii 2RG of 2k x 2k made by Teledyne is used as detector and will give a field of view of 31.9 arcmin x 31.9 arcmin. This cryogenic instrument has been optimized for the Y, J, H and K bands. Special care has been taken in the selection of the standard IR materials used for the optics in order to maximize the instrument throughput and to include the z band. The main challenges of this design are: to produce a well defined internal pupil which allows reducing the thermal background by a cryogenic pupil stop; the correction of off-axis aberrations due to the large field available; the correction of chromatic aberration because of the wide spectral coverage; and the capability of introduction of narrow band filters (~1%) in the system minimizing the degradation in the filter passband without a collimated stage in the camera. We show the optomechanical error budget and compensation strategy that allows our as built design to met the performances from an optical point of view. Finally, we demonstrate the flexibility of the design showing the performances of PANIC at the CAHA 3.5m telescope.",0
"Robot-assisted Fenestrated Endovascular Aortic Repair (FEVAR) is currently navigated by 2D fluoroscopy which is insufficiently informative. Previously, a semi-automatic 3D shape instantiation method was developed to instantiate the 3D shape of a main, deployed, and fenestrated stent graft from a single fluoroscopy projection in real-time, which could help 3D FEVAR navigation and robotic path planning. This proposed semi-automatic method was based on the Robust Perspective-5-Point (RP5P) method, graft gap interpolation and semi-automatic multiple-class marker center determination. In this paper, an automatic 3D shape instantiation could be achieved by automatic multiple-class marker segmentation and hence automatic multiple-class marker center determination. Firstly, the markers were designed into five different shapes. Then, Equally-weighted Focal U-Net was proposed to segment the fluoroscopy projections of customized markers into five classes and hence to determine the marker centers. The proposed Equally-weighted Focal U-Net utilized U-Net as the network architecture, equally-weighted loss function for initial marker segmentation, and then equally-weighted focal loss function for improving the initial marker segmentation. This proposed network outperformed traditional Weighted U-Net on the class-imbalance segmentation in this paper with reducing one hyper-parameter - the weight. An overall mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.6943 was achieved on 78 testing images, where 81.01% markers were segmented with a center position error <1.6mm. Comparable accuracy of 3D shape instantiation was also achieved and stated. The data, trained models and TensorFlow codes are available on-line.",0

"In this paper, we propose a regular vine copula based methodology for the fusion of correlated decisions. Regular vine copula is an extremely flexible and powerful graphical model to characterize complex dependence among multiple modalities. It can express a multivariate copula by using a cascade of bivariate copulas, the so-called pair copulas. Assuming that local detectors are single threshold binary quantizers and taking complex dependence among sensor decisions into account, we design an optimal fusion rule using a regular vine copula under the Neyman-Pearson framework. In order to reduce the computational complexity resulting from the complex dependence, we propose an efficient and computationally light regular vine copula based optimal fusion algorithm. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",0

"An atom that couples to two distinct leaky optical cavities is driven by an external optical white noise field. We describe how entanglement between the light fields sustained by two optical cavities arises in such a situation. The entanglement is maximized for intermediate values of the cavity damping rates and the intensity of the white noise field, vanishing both for small and for large values of these parameters and thus exhibiting a stochastic-resonance-like behaviour. This example illustrates the possibility of generating entanglement by exclusively incoherent means and sheds new light on the constructive role noise may play in certain tasks of interest for quantum information processing.",0
We show in a simple and general way that MSW resonant transitions for solar neutrinos are not observable in the case of maximal mixing among any number of neutrino generations.,0
"In many networks, it is of great interest to identify """"communities"""", unusually densely knit groups of individuals. Such communities often shed light on the function of the networks or underlying properties of the individuals. Recently, Newman suggested """"modularity"""" as a natural measure of the quality of a network partitioning into communities. Since then, various algorithms have been proposed for (approximately) maximizing the modularity of the partitioning determined. In this paper, we introduce the technique of rounding mathematical programs to the problem of modularity maximization, presenting two novel algorithms. More specifically, the algorithms round solutions to linear and vector programs. Importantly, the linear programing algorithm comes with an a posteriori approximation guarantee: by comparing the solution quality to the fractional solution of the linear program, a bound on the available """"room for improvement"""" can be obtained. The vector programming algorithm provides a similar bound for the best partition into two communities. We evaluate both algorithms using experiments on several standard test cases for network partitioning algorithms, and find that they perform comparably or better than past algorithms.",0
"Quantum mechanics establishes the ultimate limit to the scaling of the precision on any parameter, by iden- tifying optimal probe states and measurements. While this paradigm is, at least in principle, adequate for the metrology of quantum channels involving the estimation of phase and loss parameters, we show that estimat- ing the loss parameters associated with a quantum channel and a realistic quantum detector are fundamentally different. While Fock states are provably optimal for the former, we identify a crossover in the nature of the optimal probe state for estimating detector imperfections as a function of the loss parameter. We provide explicit results for on-off and homodyne detectors, the most widely used detectors in quantum photonics technologies.",0
"In the paper nonlinear transformations of the Jordan-Wigner (JW) type are introduced in the form different from the ones known previously, for the purpose of expressing multi-index Pauli operators in terms of multi-index Fermi creation and annihilation operators. These JW transformations in the general case being a subject of a rather complicated algebra of transposition relations between various sets of Fermi creation and annihilation operators, depending on the common multiindex of the latter, is shown. As an example, the two- and three- dimensional transformations of the JW type are investigated, their properties and possible applications in analysis of a couple of lattice models of statistical mechanics and also an example of application of these transformations to problems of self-avoiding walks in graph theory, are discussed. The relation of the obtained transformations to the previously known transformations of the JW type for higher dimensions is shown.",0
"If the structure of spacetime is discrete, then Lorentz symmetry should only be an approximation, valid at long length scales. At finite lattice spacings there will be small corrections to the Dirac evolution that could in principle be experimentally detected. In particular, the lattice structure should be reflected in a modification of the free-particle dispersion relation. We show that these can produce a surprisingly large phase shift between the two arms of an asymmetrical interferometer. This method could be employed to test any model that predicts a direction-dependent dispersion relation. Here, we calculate the size of this phase shift for a particular model, the 3D quantum walk on the body-centered cubic lattice, which has been shown to give rise to the Dirac equation in the continuum limit. Though the details of this model will affect the size of the shift, its magnitude is set largely by dimensional analysis, so there is reason to believe that other models would yield similar results. We find that, with current technology, a modest-sized neutron interferometer could put strong bounds on the size of the lattice spacing. This discreteness could possibly be detected even for lattice spacings at the Planck scale by a suitably scaled-up experiment.",0
"We report on a study of Gilbert damping due to particle-hole pair excitations in conducting ferromagnets. We focus on a toy two-band model and on a four-band spherical model which provides an approximate description of ferromagnetic (Ga,Mn)As. These models are sufficiently simple that disorder-ladder-sum vertex corrections to the long-wavelength spin-spin response function can be summed to all orders. An important objective of this study is to assess the reliability of practical approximate expressions which can be combined with electronic structure calculations to estimate Gilbert damping in more complex systems.",0
"We generalize unoriented handlebody-links to the twisted virtual case, obtaining Reidemeister moves for handlebody-links in ambient spaces of the form $\Sigma\times [0,1]$ for $\Sigma$ a compact closed 2-manifold up to stable equivalence. We introduce a related algebraic structure known as twisted virtual bikeigebras whose axioms are motivated by the twisted virtual handlebody-link Reidemeister moves. We use twisted virtual bikeigebras to define $X$-colorability for twisted virtual handlebody-links and define an integer-valued invariant $\Phi_{X}^{\mathbb{Z}}$ of twisted virtual handlebody-links. We provide example computations of the new invariants and use them to distinguish some twisted virtual handlebody-links.",0
"In this work we employ data-driven homogenization approaches to predict the particular mechanical evolution of polycrystalline aggregates with tens of individual crystals. In these oligocrystals the differences in stress response due to microstructural variation is pronounced. Shell-like structures produced by metal-based additive manufacturing and the like make the prediction of the behavior of oligocrystals technologically relevant. The predictions of traditional homogenization theories based on grain volumes are not sensitive to variations in local grain neighborhoods. Direct simulation of the local response with crystal plasticity finite element methods is more detailed, but the computations are expensive. To represent the stress-strain response of a polycrystalline sample given its initial grain texture and morphology we have designed a novel neural network that incorporates a convolution component to observe and reduce the information in the crystal texture field and a recursive component to represent the causal nature of the history information. This model exhibits accuracy on par with crystal plasticity simulations at minimal computational cost per prediction.",0
"The calculated electron mobility for a graphene nanoribbon as a function of applied electric field has been found to have a large threshold field for entering a nonlinear transport regime. This field depends on the lattice temperature, electron density, impurity scattering strength, nanoribbon width and correlation length for the line-edge roughness. An enhanced electron mobility beyond this threshold has been observed, which is related to the initially-heated electrons in high energy states with a larger group velocity. However, this mobility enhancement quickly reaches a maximum due to the Fermi velocity in graphene and the dramatically increased phonon scattering. Super-linear and sub-linear temperature dependence of mobility seen in the linear and nonlinear transport regimes. By analyzing the calculated non-equilibrium electron distribution function, this difference is attributed separately to the results of sweeping electrons from the right Fermi edge to the left one through the elastic scattering and moving electrons from low-energy states to high-energy ones through field-induced electron heating. The threshold field is pushed up by a decreased correlation length in the high field regime, and is further accompanied by a reduced magnitude in the mobility enhancement. This implies an anomalous high-field increase of the line-edge roughness scattering with decreasing correlation length due to the occupation of high-energy states by field-induced electron heating.",0
"Four-component massive and massless Dirac fermions in the presence of long range Coulomb interaction and chemical potential disorder exhibit striking fermionic quantum criticality. For an odd number of flavors of Dirac fermions, the sign of the Dirac mass distinguishes the topological and the trivial band insulator phases, and the gapless semi-metallic phase corresponds to the quantum critical point that separates the two. Up to a critical strength of disorder, the semi-metallic phase remains stable, and the universality class of the direct phase transition between two insulating phases is unchanged. Beyond the critical strength of disorder the semi-metallic phase undergoes a phase transition into a disorder controlled diffusive metallic phase, and there is no longer a direct phase transition between the two types of insulating phases. Our results are also applicable to even number of flavors of Dirac fermions, and the band inversion transition in various non-topological narrow gap semiconductors.",0
"In 1859, Le Verrier discovered the mercury perihelion advance anomaly. This anomaly turned out to be the first relativistic-gravity effect observed. During the 141 years to 2000, the precisions of laboratory and space experiments, and astrophysical and cosmological observations on relativistic gravity have been improved by 3 orders of magnitude. In 1999, we envisaged a 3-6 order improvement in the next 30 years in all directions of tests of relativistic gravity. In 2000, the interferometric gravitational wave detectors began their runs to accumulate data. In 2003, the measurement of relativistic Shapiro time-delay of the Cassini spacecraft determined the relativistic-gravity parameter gamma&#947; with a 1.5-order improvement. In October 2004, Ciufolini and Pavlis reported a measurement of the Lense-Thirring effect on the LAGEOS and LAGEOS2 satellites to 10 percent of the value predicted by general relativity. In April 2004, Gravity Probe B was launched and has been accumulating science data for more than 170 days now. MICROSCOPE is on its way for a 2007 launch to test Galileo equivalence principle to 10-15. STEP (Satellite Test of Equivalence Principle), and ASTROD (Astrodynamical Space Test of Relativity using Optical Devices) are in the good planning stage. Various astrophysical tests and cosmological tests of relativistic gravity will reach precision and ultra-precision stages. Clock tests and atomic interferometry tests of relativistic gravity will reach an ever-increasing precision. These will give revived interest and development both in experimental and theoretical aspects of gravity, and may lead to answers to some profound questions of gravity and the cosmos.",0
"The robustification of pattern recognition techniques has been the subject of intense research in recent years. Despite the multiplicity of papers on the subject, very few articles have deeply explored the topic of robust classification in the high dimension low sample size context. In this work, we explore and compare the predictive performances of robust classification techniques with a special concentration on robust discriminant analysis and robust PCA applied to a wide variety of large $p$ small $n$ data sets. We also explore the performance of random forest by way of comparing and contrasting the differences single model methods and ensemble methods in this context. Our work reveals that Random Forest, although not inherently designed to be robust to outliers, substantially outperforms the existing techniques specifically designed to achieve robustness. Indeed, random forest emerges as the best predictively on both real life and simulated data.",0
"The problem of primary control of high-voltage direct current transmission systems is addressed in this paper, which contains four main contributions. First, to propose a new nonlinear, more realistic, model for the system suitable for primary control design, which takes into account nonlinearities introduced by conventional inner controllers. Second, to determine necessary conditions - dependent on some free controller tuning parameters - for the existence of equilibria. Third, to formulate additional (necessary) conditions for these equilibria to satisfy the power sharing constraints. Fourth, to establish conditions for stability of a given equilibrium point. The usefulness of the theoretical results is illustrated via numerical calculations on a four-terminal example.",0
"We study the effects of noncommutativity, in the form of a Lie-algebraically deformed Poisson commutation relations, on the evolution of a Bianchi type I cosmological model with a positive cosmological constant. The phase space variables turn out to correspond to the scale factors of this model in $x$, $y$ and $z$ directions. According to the conditions that the structure constants (deformation parameters) should satisfy, we argue that there are two types of noncommutative phase space with Lie-algebraic structure. The exact classical solutions in commutative and type I noncommutative cases are presented. In the framework of this type of deformed phase space, we investigate the possibility of building a Bianchi I model with cyclic scale factors in which the size of the universe in each direction experiences an endless sequence of contractions and re-expansions. We also obtain some approximate solutions for the type II noncommutative structure by numerical methods and show that the cyclic behavior is repeated as well. These results are compared with the standard commutative case, and similarities and differences of these solutions are discussed.",0
"Abdus Salam was known for his `grand views', grand views of science as well as grand views of society. In this talk the grand view of theoretical physics is put in perspective.",0
"Isotope effects in reactions between Mg+ in the 3p 2P3/2 excited state and molecular hydrogen at thermal energies are studied through single reaction events. From only ~250 reactions with HD, the branching ratio between formation of MgD+ and MgH+ is found to be larger than 5. From additional 65 reactions with H2 and D2 we find that the overall decay probability of the intermediate MgH2+, MgHD+ or MgD2+ complexes is the same. Our study shows that few single ion reactions can provide quantitative information on ion-neutral reactions. Hence, the method is well-suited for reaction studies involving rare species, e.g., rare isotopes or short-lived unstable elements.",0
"We confirm and extend the recent finding that the central surface density r_0*rho_0 galaxy dark matter halos, where r_0 and rho_0 are the halo core radius and central density, is nearly constant and independent of galaxy luminosity. Based on the co-added rotation curves of about 1000 spiral galaxies, mass models of individual dwarf irregular and spiral galaxies of late and early types with high-quality rotation curves and, galaxy-galaxy weak lensing signals from a sample of spiral and elliptical galaxies, we find that log(r_0*rho_0) = 2.15 +- 0.2, in units of log(Msol/pc^2). We also show that the observed kinematics of Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies are consistent with this value. Our results are obtained for galactic systems spanning over 14 magnitudes, belonging to different Hubble Types, and whose mass profiles have been determined by several independent methods. In the same objects, the approximate constancy of rho_0*r_0 is in sharp contrast to the systematical variations, by several orders of magnitude, of galaxy properties, including rho_0 and central stellar surface density.",0
"We have investigated that the Goos-H\""""anchen (GH) shifts in frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) studied with wave packet propagation. In the first-order approximation of the transmission coefficient, the GH shift is exactly the expression given by stationary phase method, thus saturates an asymptotic constant in two different ways depending on the angle of incidence. Taking account into the second-order approximation, the GH shift always depends on the width of the air gap due to the modification of the beam width. It is further shown that the GH shift with second-order correction increases with decreasing the beam width at the small incidence angles, while for the large incidence angles it reveals a strong decrease with decreasing the beam width. These phenomena offers the better understanding of the tunneling delay time in FTIR.",0
"In this paper, we study the physical meaning of the wavefunction of the universe. With the continuity equation derived from the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation in the minisuperspace model, we show that the quantity $\rho(a)=|\psi(a)|^2$ for the universe is inversely proportional to the Hubble parameter of the universe. Thus, $\rho(a)$ represents the probability density of the universe staying in the state $a$ during its evolution, which we call the dynamical interpretation of the wavefunction of the universe. We demonstrate that the dynamical interpretation can predict the evolution laws of the universe in the classical limit as those given by the Friedmann equation. Furthermore, we show that the value of the operator ordering factor $p$ in the WDW equation can be determined to be $p=-2$.",0
We present a Korn-type inequality in a planar setting for special functions of bounded deformation. We prove that for each function in SBD$^2$ with sufficiently small jump set the distance of the function and its derivative from an infinitesimal rigid motion can be controlled in terms of the linearized elastic strain outside of a small exceptional set of finite perimeter. Particularly the result shows that each function in SBD$^2$ has bounded variation away from an arbitrarily small part of the domain.,0
"The CALICE collaboration is studying the design of high performance electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters for future International Linear Collider detectors. For the hadronic calorimeter, one option is a highly granular sampling calorimeter with steel as absorber and scintillator layers as active material. High granularity is obtained by segmenting the scintillator into small tiles individually read out via silicon photo-multipliers (SiPM). A prototype has been built, consisting of thirty-eight sensitive layers, segmented into about eight thousand channels. In 2007 the prototype was exposed to positrons and hadrons using the CERN SPS beam, covering a wide range of beam energies and incidence angles. The challenge of cell equalization and calibration of such a large number of channels is best validated using electromagnetic processes. The response of the prototype steel-scintillator calorimeter, including linearity and uniformity, to electrons is investigated and described.",0
"An important preprocessing step in most data analysis pipelines aims to extract a small set of sources that explain most of the data. Currently used algorithms for blind source separation (BSS), however, often fail to extract the desired sources and need extensive cross-validation. In contrast, their rarely used probabilistic counterparts can get away with little cross-validation and are more accurate and reliable but no simple and scalable implementations are available. Here we present a novel probabilistic BSS framework (DECOMPOSE) that can be flexibly adjusted to the data, is extensible and easy to use, adapts to individual sources and handles large-scale data through algorithmic efficiency. DECOMPOSE encompasses and generalises many traditional BSS algorithms such as PCA, ICA and NMF and we demonstrate substantial improvements in accuracy and robustness on artificial and real data.",0
"In this paper we address the question of whether existing X-ray observations of Seyfert galaxies are sufficiently sensitive to detect quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) similar to those observed in the X-ray variations of Galactic Black Holes (GBHs). We use data from XMM-Newton and simulated data based on the best RXTE long-term monitoring light curves, to show that if X-ray QPOs are present in Seyfert X-ray light curves - with similar shapes and strengths to those observed in GBHs, but at lower frequencies commensurate with their larger black hole masses - they would be exceedingly difficult to detect. Our results offer a simple explanation for the present lack of QPO detections in Seyferts. We discuss the improvements in telescope size and monitoring patterns needed to make QPO detections feasible. The most efficient type of future observatory for searching for X-ray QPOs in AGN is an X-ray All-Sky Monitor (ASM). A sufficiently sensitive ASM would be ideally suited to detecting low frequency QPOs in nearby AGN. The detection of AGN QPOs would strengthen the AGN-GBH connection and could serve as powerful diagnostics of the black hole mass, and the structure of the X-ray emitting region in AGN.",0
"This is a brief description of how to protect quantum states from dissipation and decoherence that arise due to uncontrolled interactions with the environment. We discuss recoherence and stabilisation of quantum states based on two techniques known as """"symmetrisation"""" and """"quantum error correction"""". We illustrate our considerations with the most popular quantum-optical model of the system-environment interaction, commonly used to describe spontaneous emission, and show the benefits of quantum error correction in this case.",0
"We present what is to our knowledge the first implementation of a Schr\""""odinger cat states """"breeding"""" operation, which allows an iterative growth of these states. We thus report the experimental generation of a squeezed Schr\""""odinger cat state from two single photon Fock states, which can be seen as cat states with zero amplitude. These Fock states are mixed on a symmetrical beamsplitter and the generation is heralded by a homodyne measurement in one of the two output arms. The output state has a fidelity of 61% with an even squeezed Schr\""""odinger cat state of amplitude $\alpha=1.63$. This hybrid operation opens up new prospects in quantum optics as the protocol depicted here can be iterated in order to produce new kind of mesoscopic states.",0
"We extend the results of Bakalov D., B.Jeziorski, T.Korona, K.Szalewicz, E.Tchoukova, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 84} (2000) 2350, on one-photon electric dipole transition line shift and broadening to the case of two-photon transitions. As an example we consider the laser induced transition in antiprotonic helium produced in helium gas target. The transition is between antiprotonic helium states $(n,l)=(33,32)$ and $(31,30)$.

"The estimated brightness of the Cygnus loop supernova remnant (SNR) at 2720, 1420, 820, 408 and 34.5 MHz are presented. The observations of the continuum radio emission are used to calculate the mean brightness temperatures and surface brightnesses of this loop at the five frequencies in wide spectral range, using the method we have previously developed for large radio loops. The spectrum for mean temperatures versus frequency between the five frequencies is estimated and the spectral index of Cygnus loop is also obtained. Also, from our results can be concluded that Cygnus loop evolves in the low density environment and the initial energy of supernova explosion was relatively low. The obtained results confirm non-thermal origin of the Cygnus radio loop and show that our method is applicable to almost all remnants.",0
"We consider the asymptotic behavior as $n\to\infty$ of the spectra of random matrices of the form \[\frac{1}{\sqrt{n-1}}\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}Z_{nk}\rho_n ((k,k+1)),\] where for each $n$ the random variables $Z_{nk}$ are i.i.d. standard Gaussian and the matrices $\rho_n((k,k+1))$ are obtained by applying an irreducible unitary representation $\rho_n$ of the symmetric group on $\{1,2,...,n\}$ to the transposition $(k,k+1)$ that interchanges $k$ and $k+1$ [thus, $\rho_n((k,k+1))$ is both unitary and self-adjoint, with all eigenvalues either +1 or -1]. Irreducible representations of the symmetric group on $\{1,2,...,n\}$ are indexed by partitions $\lambda_n$ of $n$. A consequence of the results we establish is that if $\lambda_{n,1}\ge\lambda_{n,2}\ge...\ge0$ is the partition of $n$ corresponding to $\rho_n$, $\mu_{n,1}\ge\mu_{n,2}\ge >...\ge0$ is the corresponding conjugate partition of $n$ (i.e., the Young diagram of $\mu_n$ is the transpose of the Young diagram of $\lambda_n$), $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\lambda_{n,i}}{n}=p_i$ for each $i\ge1$, and $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\mu_{n,j}}{n}=q_j$ for each $j\ge1$, then the spectral measure of the resulting random matrix converges in distribution to a random probability measure that is Gaussian with random mean $\theta Z$ and variance $1-\theta^2$, where $\theta$ is the constant $\sum_ip_i^2-\sum_jq_j^2$ and $Z$ is a standard Gaussian random variable.",0
"Emission line ratios have been essential for determining physical parameters such as gas temperature and density in astrophysical gaseous nebulae. With the advent of panoramic spectroscopic devices, images of regions with emission lines related to these physical parameters can, in principle, also be produced. We show that, with observations from modern instruments, it is possible to transform images taken from density sensitive forbidden lines into images of emission from high and low-density clouds by applying a transformation matrix. In order to achieve this, images of the pairs of density sensitive lines as well as the adjacent continuum have to be observed and combined. We have computed the critical densities for a series of pairs of lines in the infrared, optical, ultraviolet and X-rays bands, and calculated the pair line intensity ratios in the high and low-density limit using a 4 and 5 level atom approximation. In order to illustrate the method we applied it to GMOS-IFU data of two galactic nuclei. We conclude that this method provides new information of astrophysical interest, especially for mapping low and high-density clouds; for this reason we call it """"the ld/hd imaging method"""".",0
"For a regular sub-Riemannian manifold we study the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the spherical Hausdorff measure with respect to a smooth volume. We prove that this is the volume of the unit ball in the nilpotent approximation and it is always a continuous function. We then prove that up to dimension 4 it is smooth, while starting from dimension 5, in corank 1 case, it is C^3 (and C^4 on every smooth curve) but in general not C^5. These results answer to a question addressed by Montgomery about the relation between two intrinsic volumes that can be defined in a sub-Riemannian manifold, namely the Popp and the Hausdorff volume. If the nilpotent approximation depends on the point (that may happen starting from dimension 5), then they are not proportional, in general.",0
"The author has long enjoyed using the CSP refinement checker FDR to solve puzzles, as witnessed by examples in \cite{tpc,ucs}. Recent experiments have shown that a number of games of patience (card games for one) are now well within bounds. We discuss the modelling approaches used to tackle these and avoid symmetric states. For two such games we reveal much higher percentages of winnable games than was previously believed. The techniques developed for some of these card games -which employ various dynamic patterns of cards - suggest techniques for modelling pointer structures in CSP and FDR analogous to those used with the pi-calculus. Most of these use CSP's ability to express mobile systems.",0
We present a class of exact solutions of Einstein's gravitational field equations describing spherically symmetric and static anisotropic stellar type configurations. The solutions are obtained by assuming a particular form of the anisotropy factor. The energy density and both radial and tangential pressures are finite and positive inside the anisotropic star. Numerical results show that the basic physical parameters (mass and radius) of the model can describe realistic astrophysical objects like neutron stars.,0
"We present high statistics measurements of diboson production in ppbar collisions at the D\O{} experiment in multiple channels, including $ZZ \to llll$, $Z\gamma \to \nu\nu\gamma$, $WW \to l \nu l \nu$ and $WW/WZ \to l \nu jj$. These measurements both test physics beyond the standard model and demonstrate the sensitivity of hadron colliders to rare signals such as Higgs boson production.",0
"We introduce a voting model that is similar to a Keynesian beauty contest and analyze it from a mathematical point of view. There are two types of voters-copycat and independent-and two candidates. Our voting model is a binomial distribution (independent voters) doped in a beta binomial distribution (copycat voters). We find that the phase transition in this system is at the upper limit of $t$, where $t$ is the time (or the number of the votes). Our model contains three phases. If copycats constitute a majority or even half of the total voters, the voting rate converges more slowly than it would in a binomial distribution. If independents constitute the majority of voters, the voting rate converges at the same rate as it would in a binomial distribution. We also study why it is difficult to estimate the conclusion of a Keynesian beauty contest when there is an information cascade.",0
"We identify quark and gluon helicity-flip distributions defined between nucleon states of unequal momenta. The evolution of these distributions with change of renormalization scale is calculated in the leading-logarithmic approximation. The helicity-flip gluon distributions do not mix with any quark distribution and are thus a unique signature of gluons in the nucleon. Their contribution to the generalized virtual Compton process is obtained both in the form of a factorization theorem and an operator product expansion. In deeply virtual Compton scattering, they can be probed through distinct angular dependence of the cross section.",0
"SETILive is a web project forwarding radio signals from SETI Institute's Allen Telescope Array (ATA) for the analysis of volunteers. It contains a large archive with more than 1.5 millions observations for more than 7.5 thousands observation targets, including directions to exoplanets discovered by telescope Kepler and other sources. It also supports various tools for signal collection and classification. Till recent time it supported live feeds of signals from ATA together with a feedback loop, a possibility to interrupt the schedule and repeat the observation of an interesting signal registered by sufficiently many viewers. Unfortunately, since 12-Oct-2014 the live feeds have been discontinued. We hope that the project will persist, taking into account the importance of the search subject, the worldwide interest to the topic and the value of already collected data. In this paper we present the results of statistical analysis of data stored in SETILive archive, using Radon transform and specially constructed filter for selection of single beams, potential signals of ET origination. We will also estimate statistical significance of signals depending on their signal-to-noise ratio using Monte Carlo simulation and select 28 strong signals and totally 1072 statistically significant signals in the archive.",0
"We consider Newton methods for common types of single commodity and multi-commodity network flow problems. Despite the potentially very large dimension of the problem, they can be implemented using the conjugate gradient method and low-dimensional network operations, as shown nearly thirty years ago. We revisit these methods, compare them to more recent proposals, and describe how they can be implemented in a distributed computing system. We also discuss generalizations, including the treatment of arc gains, linear side constraints, and related special structures.",0
"Cre-lox and other systems are used as genetic tools to control site-specific recombination (SSR) events in genomic DNA. If multiple recombination sites are organized in a compact cluster within the same genome, a series of random recombination events may generate substantial cell specific genomic diversity. This diversity is used, for example, to distinguish neurons in the brain of the same multicellular mosaic organism, within the brainbow approach to neuronal connectome. In this paper we study an exactly solvable statistical model for SSR operating on a cluster of recombination sites. We consider two types of recombination events: inversions and excisions. Both of these events are available in the Cre-lox system. We derive three properties of the sequences generated by multiple recombination events. First, we describe the set of sequences that can in principle be generated by multiple inversions operating on the given initial sequence. We call this description the ergodicity theorem. On the basis of this description we calculate the number of sequences that can be generated from an initial sequence. This number of sequences is experimentally testable. Second, we demonstrate that after a large number of random inversions every sequence that can be generated is generated with equal probability. Lastly, we derive the equations for the probability to find a sequence as a function of time in the limit when excisions are much less frequent than inversions, such as in shufflon sequences.",0
"Detection of pulmonary nodules on chest CT is an essential step in the early diagnosis of lung cancer, which is critical for best patient care. Although a number of computer-aided nodule detection methods have been published in the literature, these methods still have two major drawbacks: missing out true nodules during the detection of nodule candidates and less-accurate identification of nodules from non-nodule. In this paper, we propose an automated pulmonary nodule detection algorithm that jointly combines progressive resolution and hierarchical saliency. Specifically, we design a 3D progressive resolution-based densely dilated FCN, namely the progressive resolution network (PRN), to detect nodule candidates inside the lung, and construct a densely dilated 3D CNN with hierarchical saliency, namely the hierarchical saliency network (HSN), to simultaneously identify genuine nodules from those candidates and estimate the diameters of nodules. We evaluated our algorithm on the benchmark LUng Nodule Analysis 2016 (LUNA16) dataset and achieved a state-of-the-art detection score. Our results suggest that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect pulmonary nodules on chest CT and accurately estimate their diameters.",0
"In this work we give a complete description to the asymptotic behaviors of exponential functionals of L\'evy processes and divide them into five different types according to their convergence rates. Not only their exact convergence speeds are proved, the accurate limit constants are also given. As an application, we study the survival probabilities of continuous-state branching processes in random environment defined in He et al. (2016). Like the discrete case and branching diffusion in random environment, we classify them into five different types according to their extinction speeds.",0
"We attempt to describe the interplay of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in QCD by using the string model. We argue that in the quasi-abelian picture of confinement based on the condensation of magnetic monopoles and the dual Meissner effect, the worldsheet dynamics of the confining string can be effectively described by the $1+1$ dimensional massless electrodynamics, which is exactly soluble. The transverse plane distribution of the chromoelectric field stretched between the quark and antiquark sources can then be attributed to the fluctuations in the position of the string. The dependence of the chiral condensate in the string on the (chromo-)electric field can be evaluated analytically, and is determined by the chiral anomaly and the $\theta$-vacuum structure. Therefore, our picture allows to predict the distribution of the chiral condensate in the plane transverse to the axis connecting the quark and antiquark. This prediction is compared to the lattice QCD results; a good agreement is found.",0
"In this note we prove analogues of the main theorems of complex multiplication for abelian varieties for K3 surfaces. This is done by studying the field of definition of the period morphism for complex K3 surfaces. More precisely we relate the moduli spaces of primitively polarized K3 surfaces with level structures over $\Q$, constructed using algebraic stacks, to the canonical model of the Shimura variety associated to $\SO(2,19)$.",0
"Taking advantage of the electron Bernstein waves heating (EBWH) system of the TJ-II stellarator, an electron Bernstein emission (EBE) diagnostic was installed. Its purpose is to investigate the B-X-O radiation properties in the zone where optimum theoretical EBW coupling is predicted. An internal movable mirror shared by both systems allows us to collect the EBE radiation along the same line of sight that is used for EBW heating. The theoretical EBE has been calculated for different orientations of the internal mirror using the TRUBA code as ray tracer. A comparison with experimental data obtained in NBI discharges is carried out. The results provide a valuable information regarding the experimental O-X mode conversion window expected in the EBW heating experiments. Furthermore, the characterization of the radiation polarization shows evidence of the underlying B-X-O conversion process.",0
"We calculate the higher topological complexity TC$_s$ for the complements of reflection arrangements, in other words for the pure Artin type groups of all finite complex reflection groups. In order to do that we introduce a simple combinatorial criterion of arrangements sufficed for the cohomological low bound for TC$_s$ to coincide with the dimensional upper bound.",0
"Critically ill patients in regular wards are vulnerable to unanticipated adverse events which require prompt transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU). To allow for accurate prognosis of deteriorating patients, we develop a novel continuous-time probabilistic model for a monitored patient's temporal sequence of physiological data. Our model captures """"informatively sampled"""" patient episodes: the clinicians' decisions on when to observe a hospitalized patient's vital signs and lab tests over time are represented by a marked Hawkes process, with intensity parameters that are modulated by the patient's latent clinical states, and with observable physiological data (mark process) modeled as a switching multi-task Gaussian process. In addition, our model captures """"informatively censored"""" patient episodes by representing the patient's latent clinical states as an absorbing semi-Markov jump process. The model parameters are learned from offline patient episodes in the electronic health records via an EM-based algorithm. Experiments conducted on a cohort of patients admitted to a major medical center over a 3-year period show that risk prognosis based on our model significantly outperforms the currently deployed medical risk scores and other baseline machine learning algorithms.",0
"We investigate the combined effect of neutrino masses and non-standard couplings on the various lepton spectra in $\mu$ and $\tau$ decays. We emphasize the energy spectra of the neutrinos, which can be measured in the new KARMEN experiment and hence will yield novel information on deviations from the $V-A$ structure. To constrain these couplings, QED radiative corrections have to be taken into account. We evaluated them and found small corrections to the neutrino spectra.",0
"In human cells, estrogenic signals induce cyclical association and dissociation of specific proteins with the DNA in order to activate transcription of estrogen-responsive genes. These oscillations can be modeled by assuming a large number of sequential reactions represented by linear kinetics with random kinetic rates. Application of the model to experimental data predicts robust binding sequences in which proteins associate with the DNA at several different phases of the oscillation. Our methods circumvent the need to derive detailed kinetic graphs, and are applicable to other oscillatory biological processes involving a large number of sequential steps.",0
"We consider a relativistic plasma containing charged chiral fermions in an external magnetic field, e.g a chirally symmetric quark-gluon plasma created in relativistic heavy ion collisions. We show that triangle anomalies imply the existence of a new type of collective gapless excitation in this system that stems from the coupling between the density waves of the electric and chiral charges; we call it """"the Chiral Magnetic Wave"""" (CMW). The CMW exists even in a neutral plasma, i.e. in the absence of the axial and vector chemical potentials. We demonstrate the existence of CMW and study its properties using three different approaches: i) relativistic magnetohydrodynamics; ii) dimensional reduction to $(1+1)$ Sine-Gordon model, appropriate in a strong magnetic field; and iii) holographic QCD (Sakai-Sugimoto model), appropriate at strong coupling. We also briefly discuss the phenomenological implications of the CMW for heavy ion collisions.",0
"We consider the use of Quantifier Elimination (QE) technology for automated reasoning in economics. QE dates back to Tarski's work in the 1940s with software to perform it dating to the 1970s. There is a great body of work considering its application in science and engineering but we show here how it can also find application in the social sciences. We explain how many suggested theorems in economics could either be proven, or even have their hypotheses shown to be inconsistent, automatically; and describe the application of this in both economics education and research. We describe a bank of QE examples gathered from economics literature and note the structure of these are, on average, quite different to those occurring in the computer algebra literature. This leads us to suggest a new incremental QE approach based on result memorization of commonly occurring generic QE results.",0
"A Hermitian metric $\omega$ on a complex manifold is called SKT or pluriclosed if $dd^c\omega=0$. Let M be a twistor space of a compact, anti-selfdual Riemannian manifold, admitting a pluriclosed Hermitian metric. We prove that in this case M is K\""""ahler, hence isomorphic to $\C P^3$ or a flag space. This result is obtained from rational connectedness of the twistor space, due to F. Campana. As an aside, we prove that the moduli space of rational curves on the twistor space of a K3 surface is Stein.",0
"Renyi and von Neumann entropies quantifying the amount of entanglement in ground states of critical spin chains are known to satisfy a universal law which is given by the Conformal Field Theory (CFT) describing their scaling regime. This law can be generalized to excitations described by primary fields in CFT, as was done in reference (Alcaraz et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 201601 (2011)), of which this work is a completion. An alternative derivation is presented, together with numerical verifications of our results in different models belonging to the c=1,1/2 universality classes. Oscillations of the Renyi entropy in excited states and descendant fields are also discussed.",0
The temperature dependence of electronic and magnetic properties of the organic charge-transfer salt (DOEO)$_4$[HgBr$_4$]TCE was investigated using magnetometry. Electronic transport properties revealed three distinct phases which are related to different magnetic coupling phenomena. In the low-temperature insulating phase (T<70 K) the antiferromagnetic coupling between two distinct sites of magnetic moments causes antiferromagnetic order below the N\'eel temperature T$_N$=40 K. In the temperature region 70-120 K the (DOEO)$_4$[HgBr$_4$]TCE shows metallic-like behavior and with further increasing of temperature it becomes a bad metal due to loss of itinerant character and increase of hopping conductivity of charge carriers.,0
We generalize the classical Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand correspondence to complete intersections in toric varieties.,0
"The capability to isolate one to few unit-cell thin layers from the bulk matrix of layered compounds opens fascinating prospects to engineer novel electronic phases. However, a comprehensive study of the thickness dependence and of potential extrinsic effects are paramount to harness the electronic properties of such atomic foils. One striking example is the charge density wave (CDW) transition temperature in layered dichalcogenides whose thickness dependence remains unclear in the ultrathin limit. Here we present a detailed study of the thickness and temperature dependences of the CDW in VSe$_2$ by scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). We show that mapping the real-space CDW periodicity over a broad thickness range unique to STM provides essential insight. We introduce a robust derivation of the local order parameter and transition temperature based on the real space charge modulation amplitude. Both quantities exhibit a striking non-monotonic thickness dependence that we explain in terms of a 3D to 2D dimensional crossover in the FS topology. This finding highlights thickness as a true tuning parameter of the electronic ground state and reconciles seemingly contradicting thickness dependencies determined in independent transport studies.",0
"We study the polynomial chaotic inflation model with a single scalar field in a double well quartic potential which has recently been shown to be consistent with Planck data. In particular, we study the effects of lifting the degeneracy between the two vacua on the inflationary observables, i.e. spectral index n_s and tensor-to-scalar perturbation ratio r_T. We find that removing the degeneracy allows the model to satisfy the upper limit constraints on r_T from Planck data, provided the field starts near the local maximum. We also calculate the scalar power spectrum and non-Gaussianity parameter f_NL for the primordial scalar perturbations in this model.",0
"Voiculescu's notion of asymptotic free independence is known for a large class of random matrices including independent unitary invariant matrices. This notion is extended for independent random matrices invariant in law by conjugation by permutation matrices. This fact leads naturally to an extension of free probability, formalized under the notions of traffic probability. We first establish this construction for random matrices. We define the traffic distribution of random matrices, which is richer than the *-distribution of free probability. The knowledge of the individual traffic distributions of independent permutation invariant families of matrices is sufficient to compute the limiting distribution of the join family. Under a factorization assumption, we call traffic independence the asymptotic rule that plays the role of independence with respect to traffic distributions. Wigner matrices, Haar unitary matrices and uniform permutation matrices converge in traffic distributions, a fact which yields new results on the limiting *-distributions of several matrices we can construct from them. Then we define the abstract traffic spaces as non commutative probability spaces with more structure. We prove that at an algebraic level, traffic independence in some sense unifies the three canonical notions of tensor, free and Boolean independence. A central limiting theorem is stated in this context, interpolating between the tensor, free and Boolean central limit theorems.",0
"We study the problem of recovering the underlining sparse signals from clean or noisy phaseless measurements. Due to the sparse prior of signals, we adopt an L0regularized variational model to ensure only a small number of nonzero elements being recovered in the signal and two different formulations are established in the modeling based on the choices of data fidelity, i.e., L2and L1norms. We also propose efficient algorithms based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) with convergence guarantee and nearly optimal computational complexity. Thanks to the existence of closed-form solutions to all subproblems, the proposed algorithm is very efficient with low computational cost in each iteration. Numerous experiments show that our proposed methods can recover sparse signals from phaseless measurements with higher successful recovery rates and lower computation cost compared with the state-of-art methods.",0
"We discuss a backward Monte-Carlo technique for muon transport problem, with emphasis on its application in muography. Backward Monte-Carlo allows exclusive sampling of a final state by reversing the simulation flow. In practice it can be made analogous to an adjoint Monte-Carlo, though it is more versatile for muon transport. A backward Monte-Carlo was implemented as a dedicated muon transport library: PUMAS. It is shown for case studies relevant for muography imaging that the implementations of forward and backward Monte-Carlo schemes agree to better than 1%.",0
"Euclidean quantum measure in Regge calculus with independent area tensors is considered using example of the Regge manifold of a simple structure. We go over to integrations along certain contours in the hyperplane of complex connection variables. Discrete connection and curvature on classical solutions of the equations of motion are not, strictly speaking, genuine connection and curvature, but more general quantities and, therefore, these do not appear as arguments of a function to be averaged, but are the integration (dummy) variables. We argue that upon integrating out the latter the resulting measure can be well-defined on physical hypersurface (for the area tensors corresponding to certain edge vectors, i.e. to certain metric) as positive and having exponential cutoff at large areas on condition that we confine ourselves to configurations which do not pass through degenerate metrics.",0
In this paper we will study a function of simultaneus measurements for quantum events (s-map) which will be compared with the conditional states on an orthomodular lattice as a basic structure for quantum logic.,0
"We introduce a novel data-driven order reduction method for nonlinear control systems, drawing on recent progress in machine learning and statistical dimensionality reduction. The method rests on the assumption that the nonlinear system behaves linearly when lifted into a high (or infinite) dimensional feature space where balanced truncation may be carried out implicitly. This leads to a nonlinear reduction map which can be combined with a representation of the system belonging to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space to give a closed, reduced order dynamical system which captures the essential input-output characteristics of the original model. Empirical simulations illustrating the approach are also provided.",0
"Starting with a formally exact diagrammatic kinetic theory for the equilibrium correlation functions of particle density and current fluctuations for a monatomic liquid, we develop a theory for high density liquids whose interatomic potential has a strongly repulsive short ranged part. We assume that interparticle collisions via this short ranged part of the potential are sufficient to randomize the velocities of the particles on a very small time scale compared with the fundamental time scale defined as the particle diameter divided by the mean thermal velocity. When this is the case, the graphical theory suggests that both the particle current correlation functions and the memory function of the particle density correlation function evolve on two distinct time scales, the very short time scale just mentioned and another that is much longer than the fundamental time scale. The diagrams that describe the motion on each of these time scales are identified. When the two time scales are very different, a dramatic simplification of the diagrammatic theory at long times takes place. We identify an irreducible memory function and a more basic function, which we call the irreducible memory kernel. This latter function evolves on the longer time scale only and determines the time dependence of the density and current correlation functions of interest at long times. In the following paper, a simple one-loop approximation for the irreducible memory kernel is used to calculate correlation functions for a Lennard-Jones fluid at high density and a variety of temperatures.",0
We present centimeter-band total flux density and linear polarization light curves illustrating the signature of shocks during radio band outbursts associated in time with gamma-ray flares detected by the Fermi LAT. The general characteristics of the spectral evolution during these events is well-explained by new radiative transfer simulations incorporating propagating oblique shocks and assuming an initially turbulent magnetic field. This finding supports the idea that oblique shocks in the jet are a viable explanation for activity from the radio to the gamma-ray band in at least some gamma-ray flares.,0
"A round disk with a harmonic disturbance impacts on a water surface and creates a non-axisymmetric cavity which collapses under the influence of hydrostatic pressure. We use disks deformed with mode m=2 to m=6. For all mode numbers we find clear evidence for a phase inversion of the cavity wall during the collapse. We present a fluid dynamics video showing high speed imaging of different modes, pointing out the characteristic features during collapse.",0
"Several methods for checking admissibility of rules in the modal logic $S4$ are presented in [1], [15]. These methods determine admissibility of rules in $S4$, but they don't determine or give substitutions rejecting inadmissible rules. In this paper, we investigate some relations between one of the above methods, based on the reduced normal form rules, and sets of substitutions which reject them. We also generalize the method in [1], [15] for one rule to admissibility of a set of rules.",0
"Fully-autonomous miniaturized robots (e.g., drones), with artificial intelligence (AI) based visual navigation capabilities are extremely challenging drivers of Internet-of-Things edge intelligence capabilities. Visual navigation based on AI approaches, such as deep neural networks (DNNs) are becoming pervasive for standard-size drones, but are considered out of reach for nanodrones with size of a few cm${}^\mathrm{2}$. In this work, we present the first (to the best of our knowledge) demonstration of a navigation engine for autonomous nano-drones capable of closed-loop end-to-end DNN-based visual navigation. To achieve this goal we developed a complete methodology for parallel execution of complex DNNs directly on-bard of resource-constrained milliwatt-scale nodes. Our system is based on GAP8, a novel parallel ultra-low-power computing platform, and a 27 g commercial, open-source CrazyFlie 2.0 nano-quadrotor. As part of our general methodology we discuss the software mapping techniques that enable the state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network presented in [1] to be fully executed on-board within a strict 6 fps real-time constraint with no compromise in terms of flight results, while all processing is done with only 64 mW on average. Our navigation engine is flexible and can be used to span a wide performance range: at its peak performance corner it achieves 18 fps while still consuming on average just 3.5% of the power envelope of the deployed nano-aircraft.",0
"Borrowing from concepts in expander graphs, we study the expansion properties of real-world, complex networks (e.g. social networks, unstructured peer-to-peer or P2P networks) and the extent to which these properties can be exploited to understand and address the problem of decentralized search. We first produce samples that concisely capture the overall expansion properties of an entire network, which we collectively refer to as the expansion signature. Using these signatures, we find a correspondence between the magnitude of maximum expansion and the extent to which a network can be efficiently searched. We further find evidence that standard graph-theoretic measures, such as average path length, fail to fully explain the level of """"searchability"""" or ease of information diffusion and dissemination in a network. Finally, we demonstrate that this high expansion can be leveraged to facilitate decentralized search in networks and show that an expansion-based search strategy outperforms typical search methods.",0
"A new mechanism of tunnelling at macroscopic distances is proposed for a wave packet localized in one-dimensional disordered potential with mirror symmetry, V(-x)=V(x). Unlike quantum tunnelling through a regular potential barrier, which occurs only at the energies lower then the barrier height, the proposed mechanism of tunnelling exists even for weak white-noise-like scattering potentials. It also exists in classical circuits of resonant contours with random resonant frequencies. The latter property may be used as a new method of secure communication, which does not require coding and decoding of the transmitting signal.",0
"Searches for supersymmetry (SUSY) are performed using a sample of hadronic events produced in 8 TeV pp collisions at the CERN LHC. The searches are based on the MT2 variable, which is a measure of the transverse momentum imbalance in an event. The data were collected with the CMS detector and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.5 inverse femtobarns. Two related searches are performed. The first is an inclusive search based on signal regions defined by the value of the MT2 variable, the hadronic energy in the event, the jet multiplicity, and the number of jets identified as originating from bottom quarks. The second is a search for a mass peak corresponding to a Higgs boson decaying to a bottom quark-antiquark pair, where the Higgs boson is produced as a decay product of a SUSY particle. For both searches, the principal backgrounds are evaluated with data control samples. No significant excess over the expected number of background events is observed, and exclusion limits on various SUSY models are derived.",0
"We study a generalized two-species model on a ring. The original model [1] describes ordinary particles hopping exclusively in one direction in the presence of an impurity. The impurity hops with a rate different from that of ordinary particles and can be overtaken by them. Here we let the ordinary particles hop also backward with the rate q. Using Matrix Product Ansatz (MPA), we obtain the relevant quadratic algebra. A finite dimensional representation of this algebra enables us to compute the stationary bulk density of the ordinary particles, as well as the speed of impurity on a set of special surfaces of the parameter space. We will obtain the phase structure of this model in the accessible region and show how the phase structure of the original model is modified. In the infinite-volume limit this model presents a shock in one of its phases.",0
"We present the first comprehensive analysis of the unitarity thresholds and anomalous thresholds of scattering amplitudes at two loops and beyond based on the loop-tree duality, and show how non-causal unphysical thresholds are locally cancelled in an efficient way when the forest of all the dual on-shell cuts is considered as one. We also prove that soft and collinear singularities at two loops and beyond are restricted to a compact region of the loop three-momenta, which is a necessary condition for implementing a local cancellation of loop infrared singularities with the ones appearing in real emission; without relying on a subtraction formalism.",0
"Discovering disease pathways, which can be defined as sets of proteins associated with a given disease, is an important problem that has the potential to provide clinically actionable insights for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Computational methods aid the discovery by relying on protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. They start with a few known disease-associated proteins and aim to find the rest of the pathway by exploring the PPI network around the known disease proteins. However, the success of such methods has been limited, and failure cases have not been well understood. Here we study the PPI network structure of 519 disease pathways. We find that 90% of pathways do not correspond to single well-connected components in the PPI network. Instead, proteins associated with a single disease tend to form many separate connected components/regions in the network. We then evaluate state-of-the-art disease pathway discovery methods and show that their performance is especially poor on diseases with disconnected pathways. Thus, we conclude that network connectivity structure alone may not be sufficient for disease pathway discovery. However, we show that higher-order network structures, such as small subgraphs of the pathway, provide a promising direction for the development of new methods.",0
"Cloud computing platform gives people the opportunity for sharing resources, services and information among the people of the whole world. In private cloud system, information is shared among the persons who are in that cloud. Presently, different types of internet based systems are running in Cloud Computing environment. E-commerce is one of them. Present models are not secured enough for executing e-transactions easily, especially in cloud platform. Again, most of the time, clients fail to distinguish between the good online business companies and the bad one, which discourages clients and companies to migrate in cloud. In this paper, we have proposed a newer e-commerce architecture depends on encryption based secured and fuzzy logic based certain trust model which will be helpful to solve present e-commerce problems. We had discussed about the whole working procedure of the model in this paper. Finally, at the end of this paper, we have discussed some experimental results about our proposed model which will help to show the validity of our model.",0
"We consider a nonlinear Neumann problem driven by a $p$-Laplacian-type, nonhomogeneous elliptic differential operator and a Carath\'eodory reaction term. In this paper we prove the existence of two extremal constant sign smooth solutions and a nontrivial nodal smooth solution. In the proof we use variational methods with truncation techniques, critical point theory and Morse theory (critical groups).",0
"We derive analytic formulae for the energy average (including the energy average of the fluctuation contribution) and variance of the intraband decay intensity of a superdeformed band. Our results may be expressed in terms of three dimensionless variables: $\Gamma^{\downarrow}/\Gamma_S$, $\Gamma_N/d$, and $\Gamma_N/(\Gamma_S+\Gamma^{\downarrow})$. Here $\Gamma^{\downarrow}$ is the spreading width for the mixing of a superdeformed (SD) state $|0>$ with the normally deformed (ND) states $|Q>$ whose spin is the same as $|0>$'s. The $|Q>$ have mean level spacing $d$ and mean electromagnetic decay width $\Gamma_N$ whilst $|0>$ has electromagnetic decay width $\Gamma_S$. The average decay intensity may be expressed solely in terms of the variables $\Gamma^{\downarrow}/\Gamma_S$ and $\Gamma_N/d$ or, analogously to statistical nuclear reaction theory, in terms of the transmission coefficients $T_0(E)$ and $T_N$ describing transmission from the $|Q>$ to the SD band via $|0\angle$ and to lower ND states. The variance of the decay intensity, in analogy with Ericson's theory of cross section fluctuations depends on an additional variable, the correlation length $\Gamma_N/(\Gamma_S+\Gamma^{\downarrow})=\frac{d}{2\pi}T_N/(\Gamma_S+\Gamma^{\d ownarrow})$. This suggests that analysis of an experimentally obtained variance could yield the mean level spacing $d$ as does analysis of the cross section autocorrelation function in compound nuclear reactions. We compare our results with those of Gu and Weidenm\""""uller.",0
"Axions can be described by a relativistic field theory with a real scalar field $\phi$ whose self-interaction potential is a periodic function of $\phi$. Low-energy axions, such as those produced in the early universe by the vacuum misalignment mechanism, can be described more simply by a nonrelativistic effective field theory with a complex scalar field $\psi$ whose effective potential is a function of $\psi^*\psi$. We determine the coefficients in the expansion of the effective potential to fifth order in $\psi^*\psi$ by matching low-energy axion scattering amplitudes. In order to describe a Bose-Einstein condensate of axions that is too dense to expand the effective potential in powers of $\psi^*\psi$, we develop a sequence of systematically improvable approximations to the effective potential that include terms of all orders in $\psi^*\psi$.",0
"In this paper we show how to define the UV completion of a scalar field theory such that it is both UV-finite and perturbatively unitary. In the UV completed theory, the propagator is an infinite sum of ordinary propagators. To eliminate the UV divergences, we choose the coefficients and masses in the propagator to satisfy certain algebraic relations, and define the infinite sums involved in Feynman diagram calculation by analytic continuation. Unitarity can be proved relatively easily by Cutkosky's rules. The theory is equivalent to infinitely many particles with specific masses and interactions. We take the $\phi^4$ theory as an example and demonstrate our idea through explicit Feynman diagram computation.",0
"The n'th Birkhoff polytope $B_n$ is the set of all doubly stochastic $n \times n$ matrices, that is, those matrices with nonnegative real coefficients in which every row and column sums to one. A long-standing open problem is the determination of the relative volume of $B_n$. In [arXiv:math.CO/0202267] we introduced a method of calculating this volume and used it to compute $\vol B_9$. This note is an update on our progress: with the same program (but much longer computing time), we have now derived $\vol B_{10}$.",0
We present an elementary elaboration of Dwork's idea of explicit $p$-adic limit formulas for zeta functions of toric hypersurfaces.,0
"We present a quantum repeater scheme based on the recently proposed qubit amplifier [N. Gisin, S. Pironio and N. Sangouard, Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 070501 (2010)]. It relies on a on-demand entangled-photon pair source which uses on-demand single-photon sources, linear optical elements and atomic ensembles. Interestingly, the imperfections affecting the states created from this source, caused e.g. by detectors with non-unit efficiencies, are systematically purified from an entanglement swapping operation based on a two-photon detection. This allows the distribution of entanglement over very long distances with a high fidelity, i.e. without vacuum components and multiphoton errors. Therefore, the resulting quantum repeater architecture does not necessitate final postselections and thus achieves high entanglement distribution rates. This also provides unique opportunities for device-independent quantum key distribution over long distances with linear optics and atomic ensembles.",0
"We revisit Hardy's inequality in the scope of regular Dirichlet forms following an analytical method. We shall give an alternative necessary and sufficient condition for the occurrence of Hardy's inequality. A special emphasis will be given for the case where the Dirichlet form under consideration is strongly local, extending therefore some known results in the Euclidean case.",0
"Many natural language processing (NLP) tasks can be generalized into segmentation problem. In this paper, we combine semi-CRF with neural network to solve NLP segmentation tasks. Our model represents a segment both by composing the input units and embedding the entire segment. We thoroughly study different composition functions and different segment embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments on two typical segmentation tasks: named entity recognition (NER) and Chinese word segmentation (CWS). Experimental results show that our neural semi-CRF model benefits from representing the entire segment and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on CWS benchmark dataset and competitive results on the CoNLL03 dataset.",0
"The Helix Nebula (NGC 7293) is the closest planetary nebulae. Therefore, it is an ideal template for photochemical studies at small spatial scales in planetary nebulae. We aim to study the spatial distribution of the atomic and the molecular gas, and the structure of the photodissociation region along the western rims of the Helix Nebula as seen in the submillimeter range with Herschel. We use 5 SPIRE FTS pointing observations to make atomic and molecular spectral maps. We analyze the molecular gas by modeling the CO rotational lines using a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) radiative transfer model. For the first time, we have detected extended OH+ emission in a planetary nebula. The spectra towards the Helix Nebula also show CO emission lines (from J= 4 to 8), [NII] at 1461 GHz from ionized gas, and [CI] (2-1), which together with the OH+ lines, trace extended CO photodissociation regions along the rims. The estimated OH+ column density is (1-10)x1e12 cm-2. The CH+ (1-0) line was not detected at the sensitivity of our observations. Non-LTE models of the CO excitation were used to constrain the average gas density (n(H2)=(1-5)x1e5 cm-3) and the gas temperature (Tk= 20-40 K). The SPIRE spectral-maps suggest that CO arises from dense and shielded clumps in the western rims of the Helix Nebula whereas OH+ and [CI] lines trace the diffuse gas and the UV and X-ray illuminated clumps surface where molecules reform after CO photodissociation. [NII] traces a more diffuse ionized gas component in the interclump medium.",0
"In this paper, we propose a greedy user selection with swap (GUSS) algorithm based on zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) for the multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) downlink channels. Since existing user selection algorithms, such as the zero-forcing with selection (ZFS), have `redundant user' and `local optimum' flaws that compromise the achieved sum rate, GUSS adds `delete' and `swap' operations to the user selection procedure of ZFS to improve the performance by eliminating `redundant user' and escaping from `local optimum', respectively. In addition, an effective channel vector based effective-channel-gain updating scheme is presented to reduce the complexity of GUSS. With the help of this updating scheme, GUSS has the same order of complexity of ZFS with only a linear increment. Simulation results indicate that on average GUSS achieves 99.3 percent of the sum rate upper bound that is achieved by exhaustive search, over the range of transmit signal-to-noise ratios considered with only three to six times the complexity of ZFS.",0
"When executing whole-body motions, humans are able to use a large variety of support poses which not only utilize the feet, but also hands, knees and elbows to enhance stability. While there are many works analyzing the transitions involved in walking, very few works analyze human motion where more complex supports occur. In this work, we analyze complex support pose transitions in human motion involving locomotion and manipulation tasks (loco-manipulation). We have applied a method for the detection of human support contacts from motion capture data to a large-scale dataset of loco-manipulation motions involving multi-contact supports, providing a semantic representation of them. Our results provide a statistical analysis of the used support poses, their transitions and the time spent in each of them. In addition, our data partially validates our taxonomy of whole-body support poses presented in our previous work. We believe that this work extends our understanding of human motion for humanoids, with a long-term objective of developing methods for autonomous multi-contact motion planning.",0
"A subgradient method is presented for solving general convex optimization problems, the main requirement being that a strictly-feasible point is known. A feasible sequence of iterates is generated, which converges to within user-specified error of optimality. Feasibility is maintained with a line-search at each iteration, avoiding the need for orthogonal projections onto the feasible region (the operation that limits practicality of traditional subgradient methods). Lipschitz continuity is not required, yet the algorithm is shown to possess a convergence rate analogous to rates for traditional methods, albeit with error measured relatively, whereas traditionally error has been absolute. The algorithm is derived using an elementary framework that can be utilized to design other such algorithms.",0
"Protein structural alignment is an important problem in computational biology. In this paper, we present first successes on provably optimal pairwise alignment of protein inter-residue distance matrices, using the popular Dali scoring function. We introduce the structural alignment problem formally, which enables us to express a variety of scoring functions used in previous work as special cases in a unified framework. Further, we propose the first mathematical model for computing optimal structural alignments based on dense inter-residue distance matrices. We therefore reformulate the problem as a special graph problem and give a tight integer linear programming model. We then present algorithm engineering techniques to handle the huge integer linear programs of real-life distance matrix alignment problems. Applying these techniques, we can compute provably optimal Dali alignments for the very first time.",0
"A strong-weak coupling duality symmetry of the string equations of motion has been suggested in the literature. This symmetry implies that vacua occur in pairs. Since the coupling constant is a dynamical variable in string theory, tunneling solutions between strong and weak coupling vacua may exist. Such solutions would naturally lead to nonperturbative effects with anomalous coupling dependence. A highly simplified example is given.",0
"A two-pass fiber-optic quantum key distribution system with phase-encoded photon states in synchronization mode has been investigated. The possibility of applying the analytical expressions for the calculation of the correct detection probability of the signal time window at synchronization has been proved. A modernized algorithm of photon pulse detection, taking into account the dead time of the single-photon avalanche photodiode was proposed. The method of engineering an optical pulse detection process during the synchronization in a quantum key distribution system has been offered.",0
"Early brain connectivity development consists of multiple stages: birth of neurons, their migration and the subsequent growth of axons and dendrites. Each stage occurs within a certain period of time depending on types of neurons and cortical layers. Forming synapses between neurons either by growing axons starting at similar times for all neurons (much-overlapped time windows) or at different time points (less-overlapped) may affect the topological and spatial properties of neuronal networks. Here, we explore the extreme cases of axon formation especially concerning short-distance connectivity during early development, either starting at the same time for all neurons (parallel, i.e. maximally-overlapped time windows) or occurring for each neuron separately one neuron after another (serial, i.e. no overlaps in time windows). For both cases, the number of potential and established synapses remained comparable. Topological and spatial properties, however, differed: neurons that started axon growth early on in serial growth achieved higher out-degrees, higher local efficiency, and longer axon lengths while neurons demonstrated more homogeneous connectivity patterns for parallel growth. Second, connection probability decreased more rapidly with distance between neurons for parallel growth than for serial growth. Third, bidirectional connections were more numerous for parallel growth. Finally, we tested our predictions with C. elegans data. Together, this indicates that time windows for axon growth influence the topological and spatial properties of neuronal networks opening the possibility to a posteriori estimate developmental mechanisms based on network properties of a developed network.",0
"The massive availability of digital repositories of human thought opens radical novel way of studying the human mind. Natural language processing tools and computational models have evolved such that many mental conditions are predicted by analysing speech. Transcription of interviews and discourses are analyzed using syntactic, grammatical or sentiment analysis to infer the mental state. Here we set to investigate if classification of Bipolar and control subjects is possible. We develop the Emotion Intensity Index based on the Dictionary of Affect, and find that subjects categories are distinguishable. Using classical classification techniques we get more than 75\% of labeling performance. These results sumed to previous studies show that current automated speech analysis is capable of identifying altered mental states towards a quantitative psychiatry.",0
"In many engineered systems, optimization is used for decision making at time-scales ranging from real-time operation to long-term planning. This process often involves solving similar optimization problems over and over again with slightly modified input parameters, often under tight latency requirements. We consider the problem of using the information available through this repeated solution process to directly learn a model of the optimal solution as a function of the input parameters, thus reducing the need to solve computationally expensive large-scale parametric programs in real time. Our proposed method is based on learning relevant sets of active constraints, from which the optimal solution can be obtained efficiently. Using active sets as features preserves information about the physics of the system, enables interpretable models, accounts for relevant safety constraints, and is easy to represent and encode. However, the total number of active sets is also very large, as it grows exponentially with system size. The key contribution of this paper is a streaming algorithm that learns the relevant active sets from training samples consisting of the input parameters and the corresponding optimal solution, without any assumptions on the problem structure. The algorithm comes with theoretical performance guarantees, and is known to converge fast for problem instances with a small number of relevant active sets. It can thus be used to establish the practicability of the learning method. Through extensive experiments on the Optimal Power Flow problem, we observe that often only a few active sets are relevant in practice, suggesting that the active sets is the appropriate level of abstraction for a learning algorithm to target.",0
"Consider the product $GX$ of two rectangular complex random matrices coupled by a constant matrix $\Omega$, where $G$ can be thought to be a Gaussian matrix and $X$ is a bi-invariant polynomial ensemble. We prove that the squared singular values form a biorthogonal ensemble in Borodin's sense, and further that for $X$ being Gaussian the correlation kernel can be expressed as a double contour integral. When all but finitely many eigenvalues of $\Omega^{} \Omega^{*}$ are equal, the corresponding correlation kernel is shown to admit a phase transition phenomenon at the hard edge in four different regimes as the coupling matrix changes. Specifically, the four limiting kernels in turn are the Meijer G-kernel for products of two independent Gaussian matrices, a new critical and interpolating kernel, the perturbed Bessel kernel and the finite coupled product kernel associated with $GX$. In the special case that $X$ is also a Gaussian matrix and $\Omega$ is scalar, such a product has been recently investigated by Akemann and Strahov. We also propose a Jacobi-type product and prove the same transition.",0
"Deep surveys in many wavebands have shown that the rate at which stars were forming was at least a factor of 10 higher at z > 1 than today. Heavy elements (metals) are produced by stars, and the star formation history deduced by these surveys implies that a significant fraction of metals in the universe today should already exist at z~2-3. However, only 10% of the total metals expected to exist at this epoch have so far been accounted for (in DLAs and the Lyman forest). In this paper, we use the results of submillimetre surveys of the local and high redshift universe to show that there was much more dust in galaxies in the past. We find that a large proportion of the missing metals are traced by this dust, bringing the metals implied from the star formation history and observations into agreement. We also show that the observed distribution of dust masses at high redshift can be reproduced remarkably well by a simple model for the evolution of dust in spheroids, suggesting that the descendants of the dusty galaxies found in the deep submm surveys are the relatively dust-free spiral bulges and ellipticals in the universe today.",0
"We review the theory of electron-conduction opacity, a fundamental ingredient in the computation of low-mass stellar models; shortcomings and limitations of the existing calculations used in stellar evolution are discussed. We then present new determinations of the electron-conduction opacity in stellar conditions for an arbitrary chemical composition, that improve over previous works and, most importantly, cover the whole parameter space relevant to stellar evolution models (i.e., both the regime of partial and high electron degeneracy). A detailed comparison with the currently used tabulations is also performed. The impact of our new opacities on the evolution of low-mass stars is assessed by computing stellar models along both the H- and He-burning evolutionary phases, as well as Main Sequence models of very low-mass stars and white dwarf cooling tracks.",0
"We monitored the chromospheric activity in the Ca II H & K lines of 13 solar-type stars (including the Sun); 8 of them over three years at the CFHT and 5 in a single run at the VLT. Ten of the 13 targets have close planetary companions. All of the stars observed at the CFHT show long-term (months to years) changes in H & K intensity levels. Four stars display short-term (days) cyclical activity. For two, HD 73256 and kappa^1 Ceti, the activity is likely associated with an active region rotating with the star, however, the flaring in excess of the rotational modulation may be associated with a hot jupiter. A planetary companion remains a possibility for kappa^1 Ceti. For the other two, HD 179949 and upsilon And, the cyclic variation is synchronized to the hot jupiter's orbit. For both stars this synchronicity with the orbit is clearly seen in two out of three epochs. The effect is only marginal in the third epoch at which the seasonal level of chromospheric activity had changed for both stars. Short-term chromospheric activity appears weakly dependent on the mean K-line reversal intensities for the sample of 13 stars. Also, a suggestive correlation exists between this activity and the M_p sin(i) of the star's hot jupiter. Because of their small separation (<= 0.1 AU), many of the hot jupiters lie within the Alfv\'en radius of their host stars which allows a direct magnetic interaction with the stellar surface. We discuss the conditions under which a planet's magnetic field might induce activity on the stellar surface and why no such effect was seen for the prime candidate, tau Boo. This work opens up the possibility of characterizing planet-star interactions, with implications for extrasolar planet magnetic fields and the energy contribution to stellar atmospheres.",0
"Corporations are retaining ever-larger corpuses of personal data; the frequency or breaches and corresponding privacy impact have been rising accordingly. One way to mitigate this risk is through use of anonymized data, limiting the exposure of individual data to only where it is absolutely needed. This would seem particularly appropriate for data mining, where the goal is generalizable knowledge rather than data on specific individuals. In practice, corporate data miners often insist on original data, for fear that they might """"miss something"""" with anonymized or differentially private approaches. This paper provides a theoretical justification for the use of anonymized data. Specifically, we show that a support vector classifier trained on anatomized data satisfying l-diversity should be expected to do as well as on the original data. Anatomy preserves all data values, but introduces uncertainty in the mapping between identifying and sensitive values, thus satisfying l-diversity. The theoretical effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated using several publicly available datasets, showing that we outperform the state of the art for support vector classification using training data protected by k-anonymity, and are comparable to learning on the original data.",0
"We engineer compact SU(5) Grand Unified Theories in F-theory in which GUT-breaking is achieved by a discrete Wilson line. Because the internal gauge field is flat, these models avoid the high scale threshold corrections associated with hypercharge flux. Along the way, we exemplify the `local-to-global' approach in F-theory model building and demonstrate how the Tate divisor formalism can be used to address several challenges of extending local models to global ones. These include in particular the construction of G-fluxes that extend non-inherited bundles and the engineering of U(1) symmetries. We go beyond chirality computations and determine the precise (charged) massless spectrum, finding exactly three families of quarks and leptons but excessive doublet and/or triplet pairs in the Higgs sector (depending on the example) and vector-like exotics descending from the adjoint of SU(5)_{GUT}. Understanding why vector-like pairs persist in the Higgs sector without an obvious symmetry to protect them may shed light on new solutions to the mu problem in F-theory GUTs.",0
"The aim of this note is to announce some results on the GIT problem for the Hilbert and Chow scheme of curves of degree d and genus g in P^{d-g}, whose full details will appear in a subsequent paper. In particular, we extend the previous results of L. Caporaso up to d>4(2g-2) and we observe that this is sharp. In the range 2(2g-2)<d<7/2(2g-2), we get a complete new description of the GIT quotient. As a corollary, we get a new compactification of the universal Jacobian over the moduli space of pseudo-stable curves.",0
"We formulate a definition of isometric action of a compact quantum group (CQG) on a compact metric space, generalizing Banica's definition for finite metric spaces. For metric spaces $(X,d)$ which can be isometrically embedded in some Euclidean space, we prove the existence of a universal object in the category of the compact quantum groups acting isometrically on $(X,d)$. In fact, our existence theorem applies to a larger class, namely for any compact metric space $(X,d)$ which admits a one-to-one continuous map $f : X \raro \IR^n$ for some $n$ such that $d_0(f(x),f(y))=\phi(d(x,y))$ (where $d_0$ is the Euclidean metric) for some homeomorphism $\phi$ of $\IR^+$. As concrete examples, we obtain Wang's quantum permutation group $\cls_n^+$ and also the free wreath product of $\IZ_2$ by $\cls_n^+$ as the quantum isometry groups for certain compact connected metric spaces constructed by taking topological joins of intervals in \cite{huang1}.",0
"As a consistency check of the staggered-fermion fourth-root approximation, we analyze the a_0 and f_0 correlators, including the effects of two-meson taste-multiplet intermediate states. Rooted staggered chiral perturbation theory describes the contributions from the pseudoscalar taste multiplets in terms of only a few low energy constants, which have all been previously determined by the MILC collaboration. In previous work one of us (Prelovsek) showed that the two-meson ``bubble'' contributions could explain the observed anomalies in the lattice data for the isovector a_0 channel. In the present work we extend this analysis to the f_0 channel. On a MILC collaboration lattice ensemble at 0.12 fm with 2+1 flavors of Asqtad-improved staggered fermions, we have made new measurements of correlators in both channels for a variety of momenta. A fit to these correlators gives low energy constants that are reasonably consistent with previous determinations by the MILC collaboration.}",0
"We present here the concept of three-arm current comparator impedance bridge, which allows comparisons among three unlike impedances. Its purpose is the calibration of impedances having arbitrary phase angles, against calibrated nearly-pure impedances. An analysis of the bridge optimal setting and proper operation is presented. To test the concept, a two terminal-pair digitally-assisted bridge has been realized; measurements of an air-core inductor and of an RC network versus decade resistance and capacitance standards, at kHz frequency, have been performed. The bridge measurements are compatible with previous knowledge of the standards' values with relative deviations in the 10^-5 -- 10^-6 range.",0
"The idea of replacing an edgy perfectly conducting boundary by the corresponding interface filled with a dielectric material of extreme complex permittivities, is examined in the present work. A semi-analytical solution to the corresponding boundary value problems is obtained and the merit of the modeling has been checked. Certain conclusions for the effect of the constituent material parameters and the geometric features of the configuration on the model effectiveness, are drawn and discussed.",0
"This paper presents a new counter-measure to mitigate denial-of-service cyber-attacks in linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. We first design a sparse linear quadratic regulator (LQR) optimal controller for a given LTI plant and evaluate the priority of the feedback communication links in terms of the loss of closed-loop performance when the corresponding block of the feedback gain matrix is removed. An attacker may know about this priority ordering, and thereby attack the links with the highest priority. To prevent this, we present a message rerouting strategy by which the states that are scheduled to be transmitted through the high priority links can be rerouted through lower priority ones in case the former get attacked. Since the attacked link is not available for service, and the states of the low priority links can no longer be accommodated either, we run a structured $\mathcal{H}_2$ control algorithm to determine the post-attack optimal feedback gains. We illustrate various aspects of the proposed algorithms by simulations.",0
"We give a new definition of Levi-Civita connection for a noncommutative pseudo-Riemannian metric on a noncommutative manifold given by a spectral triple. We prove the existence-uniqueness result for a class of modules of one forms over a large class of noncommutative manifolds, including the matrix geometry of the fuzzy 3-sphere, the quantum Heisenberg manifolds and Connes-Landi deformations of spectral triples on the Connes-Dubois Violette-Rieffel-deformation of a compact manifold equipped with a free toral action. It is interesting to note that in the example of the quantum Heisenberg manifold, the definition of metric compatibility given in the paper by Frolich et al failed to ensure the existence of a unique Levi-Civita connection. In the case of the matrix geometry, the Levi-Civita connection that we get coincides with the unique real torsion-less unitary connection obtained by Frolich et al.",0
We introduce two-parameter quantum toroidal algebras of simply laced types and provide their group theoretic realization using finite subgroups of $SL_2(\mathbb C)$ via McKay correspondence. In particular our construction contains a realization of the vertex representation of the two-parameter quantum affine algebras of $ADE$ types.,0
"We discuss what can be learned about the baryon density from an all-sky map of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) with sub-degree angular resolution. With only minimal assumptions about the primordial spectrum of density perturbations and the values of other cosmological parameters, such a CMB map should be able to distinguish between a Universe with a baryon density near 0.1 and a baryon-dominated Universe. With additional reasonable assumptions, it is conceivable that such measurements will constrain the baryon density to an accuracy similar to that obtained from BBN calculations.",0
"We performed a high-sensitivity search for galaxy-scale magnetic fields by radio polarimetry at 10.45GHz and 4.85GHz with the Effelsberg 100m radio telescope, accompanied by Halpha imaging, for the two Local Group irregular galaxies IC10 and NGC6822. Their star-forming bodies are small and rotate slowly. IC10 is known to have a very high star-forming activity, resembling blue compact dwarfs, while NGC6822 has a low overall star-formation level. Despite very different current star formation rates, our Halpha imaging revealed a large web of diffuse Halpha filaments and shells in both IC10 and NGC6822. Some of them extend far away from the galaxy's main body. The total power emission of both objects shows bright peaks either at the positions of optically strong star-forming clumps (IC10) or individual HII regions or supernova remnants (NGC6822). However, in both cases we detect a smoothly distributed, extended component. In IC10 we found clear evidence for the presence of a diffuse, mostly random magnetic field of ~14muG strength, probably generated by a fluctuation dynamo. One of the Halpha-emitting filaments appears to be associated with enhanced magnetic fields. We also rediscuss the reddening of IC10 and its implications for its distance. In the case of NGC6822 we found only very weak evidence for nonthermal emission, except perhaps for some regions associated with local gas compression. We detect in both galaxies small spots of polarized emission, indicative of regular fields (~3muG), at least partly associated with local compressional phenomena.",0
"Elastic network models (ENM) and constraint-based, topological rigidity analysis are two distinct, coarse-grained approaches to study conformational flexibility of macromolecules. In the two decades since their introduction, both have contributed significantly to insights into protein molecular mechanisms and function. However, despite a shared purpose of these approaches, the topological nature of rigidity analysis, and thereby the absence of motion modes, has impeded a direct comparison. Here, we present an alternative, kinematic approach to rigidity analysis, which circumvents these drawbacks. We introduce a novel protein hydrogen bond network spectral decomposition, which provides an orthonormal basis for collective motions modulated by non-covalent interactions, analogous to the eigenspectrum of normal modes, and decomposes proteins into rigid clusters identical to those from topological rigidity. Our kinematic flexibility analysis bridges topological rigidity theory and ENM, and enables a detailed analysis of motion modes obtained from both approaches. Our analysis reveals that collectivity of protein motions, reported by the Shannon entropy, is significantly lower for rigidity theory versus normal mode approaches. Strikingly, kinematic flexibility analysis suggests that the hydrogen bonding network encodes a protein-fold specific, spatial hierarchy of motions, which goes nearly undetected in ENM. This hierarchy reveals distinct motion regimes that rationalize protein stiffness changes observed from experiment and molecular dynamics simulations. A formal expression for changes in free energy derived from the spectral decomposition indicates that motions across nearly 40% of modes obey enthalpy-entropy compensation. Taken together, our analysis suggests that hydrogen bond networks have evolved to modulate protein structure and dynamics.",0
"State-action value functions (i.e., Q-values) are ubiquitous in reinforcement learning (RL), giving rise to popular algorithms such as SARSA and Q-learning. We propose a new notion of action value defined by a Gaussian smoothed version of the expected Q-value. We show that such smoothed Q-values still satisfy a Bellman equation, making them learnable from experience sampled from an environment. Moreover, the gradients of expected reward with respect to the mean and covariance of a parameterized Gaussian policy can be recovered from the gradient and Hessian of the smoothed Q-value function. Based on these relationships, we develop new algorithms for training a Gaussian policy directly from a learned smoothed Q-value approximator. The approach is additionally amenable to proximal optimization by augmenting the objective with a penalty on KL-divergence from a previous policy. We find that the ability to learn both a mean and covariance during training leads to significantly improved results on standard continuous control benchmarks.",0
"Domain wall (DW) moving in media undergoes the friction force due to particle scattering. However certain particles are not scattered, but perforate the wall. As a result, the wall gets excited in the form of the branon wave, while the particle experiences an acceleration jump. This gives rise to generation of gravitational waves which we call """"piercing gravitational radiation"""" (PGR). Though this effect is of higher order in the gravitational constant than the quadrupole radiation from the collapsing DWs, its amplitude is enhanced in the case of relativistic particles or photons because of absence of the velocity factor which is present in the quadrupole formula. We derive the spectral-angular distribution of PGR within the simplified model of the weakly gravitating particle-wall system in Minkowski space-time of arbitrary dimensions. Within this model the radiation amplitude is obtained analytically. The spectral-angular distribution of PGR in such an approach suffers from infrared and ultraviolet divergences as well as from collinear divergence in the case of a massless perforating particle. Different cut-off schemes appropriate in various dimensions are discussed. Our results are applicable both to cosmological DWs and to the braneworld models.",0
"The implementation of circuit quantum electrodynamics allows coupling distant qubits by microwave photons hosted in on-chip superconducting resonators. Typically, the qubit-photon interaction is realized by coupling the photons to the electric dipole moment of the qubit. A recent proposal suggests storing the quantum information in the electric quadrupole moment of an electron in a triple quantum dot. The qubit is expected to have improved coherence since it is insensitive to dipolar noise produced by distant voltage fluctuators. Here we experimentally realize a quadrupole qubit in a linear array of three quantum dots in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure. A high impedance microwave resonator coupled to the middle dot interacts with the qubit quadrupole moment. We demonstrate strong quadrupole qubit--photon coupling and observe improved coherence properties when operating the qubit in the parameter space where the dipole coupling vanishes.",0
"To facilitate the search for a continuum limit of causal dynamical triangulations, Ambjorn, Coumbe, Gizbert-Studnicki, and Jurkiewicz recently reported measurements of the lattice spacing as a function of the bare couplings. Although these authors' methods are technically sound, the conclusions that they draw from their analyses rest crucially on certain unstated assumptions. I elucidate these assumptions, and I argue that our current understanding of causal dynamical triangulations does not entail their justification.",0
"We have used ion-irradiation to damage the (001) surfaces of SmB_6 single crystals to varying depths, and have measured the resistivity as a function of temperature for each depth of damage. We observe a reduction in the residual resistivity with increasing depth of damage. Our data are consistent with a model in which the surface state is not destroyed by the ion-irradiation, but instead the damaged layer is poorly conducting and the initial surface state is reconstructed below the damage. This behavior is consistent with a surface state that is topologically protected.",0
"A novel two-state, Reversible Cellular Automata (RCA) is described. This three-dimensional RCA is shown to be capable of universal computation. Additionally, evidence is offered that this RCA Is capable of universal construction.",0
"Many of the properties of graphene are tied to its lattice structure, allowing for tuning of charge carrier dynamics through mechanical strain. The graphene electro-mechanical coupling yields very large pseudomagnetic fields for small strain fields, up to hundreds of Tesla, which offer new scientific opportunities unattainable with ordinary laboratory magnets. Significant challenges exist in investigation of pseudomagnetic fields, limited by the non-planar graphene geometries in existing demonstrations and the lack of a viable approach to controlling the distribution and intensity of the pseudomagnetic field. Here we reveal a facile and effective mechanism to achieve programmable extreme pseudomagnetic fields with uniform distributions in a planar graphene sheet over a large area by a simple uniaxial stretch. We achieve this by patterning the planar graphene geometry and graphene-based hetero-structures with a shape function to engineer a desired strain gradient. Our method is geometrical, opening up new fertile opportunities of strain engineering of electronic properties of 2D materials in general.",0
"We draw an analogy between the deconfining transition in the 2+1 dimensional Georgi-Glashow model and the chiral phase transition in 3+1 dimensional QCD. Based on the detailed analysis of the former (hep-th/0010201) we suggest that the chiral symmetry restoration in QCD at high temperature is driven by the thermal ensemble of baryons and anti-baryons. The chiral symmetry is restored when roughly half of the volume is occupied by the baryons. Surprisingly enough, even though baryons are rather heavy, a crude estimate for the critical temperature gives $T_c=180$ Mev. In this scenario the binding of the instantons is not the cause but rather a consequence of the chiral symmetry restoration.",0
"The typical algorithmic problem in viral marketing aims to identify a set of influential users in a social network, who, when convinced to adopt a product, shall influence other users in the network and trigger a large cascade of adoptions. However, the host (the owner of an online social platform) often faces more constraints than a single product, endless user attentions, unlimited budget and unbounded time; in reality, multiple products need to be advertised, each user can tolerate only a small number of recommendations, influencing user has a cost and advertisers have only limited budgets, and the adoptions need to be maximized within a short time window. Given theses myriads of user, monetary, and timing constraints, it is extremely challenging for the host to design principled and efficient viral market algorithms with provable guarantees. In this paper, we provide a novel solution by formulating the problem as a submodular maximization in a continuous-time diffusion model under an intersection of a matroid and multiple knapsack constraints. We also propose an adaptive threshold greedy algorithm which can be faster than the traditional greedy algorithm with lazy evaluation, and scalable to networks with million of nodes. Furthermore, our mathematical formulation allows us to prove that the algorithm can achieve an approximation factor of $k_a/(2+2 k)$ when $k_a$ out of the $k$ knapsack constraints are active, which also improves over previous guarantees from combinatorial optimization literature. In the case when influencing each user has uniform cost, the approximation becomes even better to a factor of $1/3$. Extensive synthetic and real world experiments demonstrate that our budgeted influence maximization algorithm achieves the-state-of-the-art in terms of both effectiveness and scalability, often beating the next best by significant margins.",0
"We consider random binary trees that appear as the output of certain standard algorithms for sorting and searching if the input is random. We introduce the subtree size metric on search trees and show that the resulting metric spaces converge with probability 1. This is then used to obtain almost sure convergence for various tree functionals, together with representations of the respective limit random variables as functions of the limit tree.",0
"With high-Tc cuprates in mind, properties of correlated dx2-y2-wave superconducting (SC) and antiferromagnetic (AF) states are studied for the Hubbard (t-t'-U) model on square lattices, using a variational Monte Carlo method. We employ simple trial wave functions including only crucial parameters, such as a doublon-holon binding factor indispensable to describe correlated SC and normal states as doped Mott insulators. U/t, t'/t and \delta (doping rate) dependence of relevant quantities are systematically calculated. As U/t increases, a sharp crossover of SC properties occurs at U_co/t \sim 10 from a conventional BCS type to a kinetic-energy-driven type for any t'/t. As \delta decreases, U_co/t is smoothly connected to the Mott transition point at half filling. For U/t\lsim 5, steady superconductivity corresponding to the cuprates is not found, whereas the d-wave SC correlation function Pd^\infty rapidly increases for U/t\gsim 6 and becomes maximum at U=U_co. Comparing the \delta dependence of Pd^\infty with experimentally observed dome-shaped Tc and condensation energy, we find that the effective value of $U$ for the cuprates should be larger than the band width, for which the t-J model is valid. Analyzing the kinetic energy, we reveal that for U>U_co only doped holes (electrons) become charge carriers, which will make a small Fermi surface (hole pocket), but for U<U_co all the electrons (holes) contribute to conduction and will make an ordinary large Fermi surface, which is contradictory to the feature of cuprates. By introducing a proper negative (positive) t'/t, the SC (AF) state is stabilized. In the underdoped regime, the strength of SC for U>U_co is determined by two factors, i.e., the AF spin correlation, which creates singlet pairs (pseudogap), and the charge mobility dominated by Mott physics.",0
"For positive integers $N$ and $r \geq 2$, an $r$-monotone coloring of $\binom{\{1,\dots,N\}}{r}$ is a 2-coloring by $-1$ and $+1$ that is monotone on the lexicographically ordered sequence of $r$-tuples of every $(r+1)$-tuple from~$\binom{\{1,\dots,N\}}{r+1}$. Let ${\overline{R}_{mon}}(n;r)$ be the minimum $N$ such that every $r$-monotone coloring of $\binom{\{1,\dots,N\}}{r}$ contains a monochromatic copy of $\binom{\{1,\dots,n\}}{r}$. For every $r \geq 3$, it is known that ${\overline{R}_{mon}}(n;r) \leq tow_{r-1}(O(n))$, where $tow_h(x)$ is the tower function of height $h-1$ defined as $tow_1(x)=x$ and $tow_h(x) = 2^{tow_{h-1}(x)}$ for $h \geq 2$. The Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres Lemma and the Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres Theorem imply ${\overline{R}_{mon}}(n;2)=(n-1)^2+1$ and ${\overline{R}_{mon}}(n;3)=\binom{2n-4}{n-2}+1$, respectively. It follows from a result of Eli\'{a}\v{s} and Matou\v{s}ek that ${\overline{R}_{mon}}(n;4)\geq tow_3(\Omega(n))$. We show that ${\overline{R}_{mon}}(n;r)\geq tow_{r-1}(\Omega(n))$ for every $r \geq 3$. This, in particular, solves an open problem posed by Eli\'{a}\v{s} and Matou\v{s}ek and by Moshkovitz and Shapira. Using two geometric interpretations of monotone colorings, we show connections between estimating ${\overline{R}_{mon}}(n;r)$ and two Ramsey-type problems that have been recently considered by several researchers. Namely, we show connections with higher-order Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres theorems and with Ramsey-type problems for order-type homogeneous sequences of points. We also prove that the number of $r$-monotone colorings of $\binom{\{1,\dots,N\}}{r}$ is $2^{N^{r-1}/r^{\Theta(r)}}$ for $N \geq r \geq 3$, which generalizes the well-known fact that the number of simple arrangements of~$N$ pseudolines is $2^{\Theta(N^2)}$.",0
"Dimension reduction due to the orbital ordering has recently been proposed to explain the exotic charge, magnetic and structural transitions in some three-dimensional (3D) transitional metal oxides. We present optical measurement on a spinel compound MgTi$_2$O$_4$ which undergoes a sharp metal-insulator transition at 240 K, and show that the spectral change across the transition can be well understood from the proposed picture of 1D Peierls transition driven by the ordering of $d_{yz}$ and $d_{zx}$ orbitals. We further elaborate that the orbital-driven instability picture applies also very well to the optical data of another spinel CuIr$_2$S$_4$ reported earlier.",0
"Subdivision surfaces are proven to be a powerful tool in geometric modeling and computer graphics, due to the great flexibility they offer in capturing irregular topologies. This paper discusses the robust and efficient implementation of an isogeometric discretization approach to partial differential equations on surfaces using subdivision methodology. Elliptic equations with the Laplace-Beltrami and the surface bi-Laplacian operator as well as the associated eigenvalue problems are considered. Thereby, efficiency relies on the proper choice of a numerical quadrature scheme which preserves the expected higher order consistency. A particular emphasis is on the robustness of the approach in the vicinity of extraordinary vertices. In this paper, the focus is on Loop's subdivision scheme on triangular meshes. Based on a series of numerical experiments, different quadrature schemes are compared and a mid-edge quadrature, which is easy-to-implement via lookup tables, turns out to be a preferable choice due to its robustness and efficiency.",0
"A large-scale configuration-interaction (CI) calculation is reported for the hyperfine splitting of the 2^2S and 3^2S states of ^7Li and ^9Be^+. The CI calculation based on the Dirac-Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian is supplemented with a separate treatment of the QED, nuclear-size, nuclear-magnetization distribution, and recoil corrections. The nonrelativistic limit of the CI results is in excellent agreement with variational calculations. The theoretical values obtained for the hyperfine splitting are complete to the relative order of \alpha^2 and improve upon results of previous studies.",0
I discuss how local thermal equilibrium and hydrodynamical flow are reached in heavy-ion collisions in the weak coupling limit.,0
"We have studied a bulk electrolyte, and polyelectrolyte solutions with surfactants or multivalent salt with the explicit presence of counterions and solvent molecules by means of the mesoscopic dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) method in the Grand Canonical ensemble. The electrostatic interactions are calculated using the Ewald sum method and the structure of the fluid is analyzed through the radial distribution function between charged particles. The results are in very good agreement with those reported in the literature using a different method for the calculation of the electrostatic forces, and with those obtained using DPD in the canonical ensemble. We also studied the salt dependent conformation of polyelectrolyte solutions as a function of the solvent quality, and analyzed the electrostatic interaction strength dependence of dilute flexible polyelectrolytes in solution. For the complex systems mentioned above, the electrostatic interactions and the solvent quality play a key role in understanding phenomena that do not occur in noncharged systems.",0
"We present the first adaptive strategy for active learning in the setting of classification with smooth decision boundary. The problem of adaptivity (to unknown distributional parameters) has remained opened since the seminal work of Castro and Nowak (2007), which first established (active learning) rates for this setting. While some recent advances on this problem establish adaptive rates in the case of univariate data, adaptivity in the more practical setting of multivariate data has so far remained elusive. Combining insights from various recent works, we show that, for the multivariate case, a careful reduction to univariate-adaptive strategies yield near-optimal rates without prior knowledge of distributional parameters.",0
"Vertex corrections are taken into account in the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the nucleon propagator in a relativistic field theory of fermions and mesons. The usual Hartree-Fock approximation for the nucleon propagator is known to produce the appearance of complex (ghost) poles which violate basic theorems of quantum field theory. In a theory with vector mesons there are vertex corrections that produce a strongly damped vertex function in the ultraviolet. One set of such corrections is known as the Sudakov form factor in quantum electrodynamics. When the Sudakov form factor generated by massive neutral vector mesons is included in the Hartree-Fock approximation to the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the nucleon propagator, the ghost poles disappear and consistency with basic requirements of quantum field theory is recovered.",0
"We theoretically demonstrate the capability of a ferromagnetic-normal (FN) interface in graphene to focus an electron-wave with a certain spin direction. The essential feature is the negative refraction Klein tunneling, which is spin-resolved when the exchange energy of F graphene exceeds its Fermi energy. Exploiting this property, we propose a graphene NFN electronic spin lens through which an unpolarized electronic beam can be collimated with a finite spin-polarization. Our study reveals that magnetic graphene has the potential to be the electronic counterpart of the recently discovered photonic chiral meta-materials that exhibit a negative refractive index for only one direction of the circular polarization of the photon-wave.",0
"Using combined strong coupling and hopping parameter expansions, we derive an effective three-dimensional theory from thermal lattice QCD with heavy Wilson quarks. The theory depends on traced Polyakov loops only and correctly reflects the centre symmetry of the pure gauge sector as well as its breaking by finite mass quarks. It is valid up to certain orders in the lattice gauge coupling and hopping parameter, which can be systematically improved. To its current order it is controlled for lattices up to N_\tau\sim 6 at finite temperature. For nonzero quark chemical potentials, the effective theory has a fermionic sign problem which is mild enough to carry out simulations up to large chemical potentials. Moreover, by going to a flux representation of the partition function, the sign problem can be solved. As an application, we determine the deconfinement transition and its critical end point as a function of quark mass and all chemical potentials.",0
"A system, which implements persistent objects, has to provide different opportunities to change the objects in arbitrary ways during their existence. A traditional realization of OO paradigm in modern programming systems has fundamental drawbacks which complicate an implementation of persistent modifiable objects considerably. There is alternative realization that does not have these drawbacks. In the article the PROGRESS operation is offered, which modify existing object within an existing inheritance hierarchy.",0
"In this paper, we show that the total area of two distinct surfaces with Gaussian curvature equal to 1, which are also conformal to the Euclidean unit disk with the same conformal factor on the boundary, must be at least 4{\pi}. In other words, the areas of these surfaces must cover the whole unit sphere after a proper rearrangement. We refer to this lower bound of total area as the Sphere Covering Inequality. The inequality and its generalizations are applied to a number of open problems related to Moser- Trudinger type inequalities, mean field equations and Onsager vortices, etc, and yield optimal results.",0
"In this paper, we examine two types of interacting holographic dark energy model using Pantheon supernova data, BAO BOSS DR12, CMB Planck 2015, fgas (gas mass fraction) and SZ/Xray (Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect and X-ray emission) data from galaxy clusters (GC). In particular, we considered the Holographic Ricci dark energy and Extended holographic Ricci dark energy models. During this analysis we considered seven type of phenomenological interaction terms (three linear and four non-linear) $Q_1=3Hb\rho_{D}$, $Q_2=3Hb\rho_{m}$, $Q_3=3Hb\left(\rho_{D}+\rho_m\right)$, $Q_4=3Hb\left(\rho_{D}+\frac{\rho_{D}^2}{\rho_{D}+\rho_m}\right)$, $Q_5=3Hb\left(\rho_{m}+\frac{\rho_{m}^2}{\rho_{D}+\rho_m}\right)$, $Q_6=3Hb\left(\rho_{D}+\rho_{m}+\frac{\rho_{D}^2}{\rho_{D}+\rho_m}\right)$, $Q_7=3Hb\left(\rho_{D}+\rho_{m}+\frac{\rho_{m}^2}{\rho_{D}+\rho_m}\right)$ respectively. To find the best model we apply Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and use the $\Lambda$CDM as the referring model for comparison. Using AIC and BIC models selection method we note that the $Q_1$ and $Q_4$ interaction terms are favored by observational data within the context of the holographic Ricci dark energy models. The obtained results also demonstrated that the considered types of holographic Ricci dark energy model are not favored by observational data since the $\Lambda$CDM is considered as the reference model. We also observed that the values of the deceleration parameter and the transition redshift for all models are compatible with the latest observational data and Planck 2015. In addition, we studied the jerk parameter for all models. Using our modified CAMB code, we observed that the interacting models suppress the CMB spectrum at low multi-poles and enhances the acoustic peaks.",0
"The principal paradigm for the prompt emission of gamma-ray bursts invokes diffusive acceleration at shocks internal to the dynamic ultrarelativistic outflow. This paper explores expectations for burst emission spectra arising from shock acceleration theory in the limit of particles cooling much slower than their acceleration. Parametric fits to burst spectra obtained by the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory (CGRO) are explored for the cases of the synchrotron, inverse Compton and synchrotron self-Compton radiation mechanisms, using a linear combination of thermal and non-thermal electron populations. These fits demand that the preponderance of electrons that are responsible for the prompt emission reside in an intrinsically non-thermal population, strongly contrasting particle distributions obtained from acceleration simulations. This implies a potential conflict for acceleration scenarios where the non-thermal electrons are drawn directly from a thermal gas. It is also found that the CGRO data preclude effective spectroscopic discrimination between the synchrotron and inverse Compton mechanisms. This situation may be resolved with future missions probing gamma-ray bursts, namely Swift and GLAST. However, the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) spectrum is characteristically too broad near the $\nu F_{\nu}$ peak to viably account for bursts such as GRB 910601, GRB 910814 and GRB 990123. It is concluded that the SSC mechanism may be generally incompatible with differential burst spectra steeper than around $E^{-2.5}$ above the peak, unless the synchrotron component is strongly self-absorbed.",0
"During the fabrication process of large scale silicene through common chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique, polycrystalline films are quite likely to be produced, and the existence of Kapitza thermal resistance along grain boundaries could result in substantial changes of their thermal properties. In the present study, the thermal transport along polycrystalline silicene was evaluated by performing a multiscale method. Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations (NEMD) was carried out to assess the interfacial thermal resistance of various constructed grain boundaries in silicene as well as to examine the effects of tensile strain and the mean temperature on the interfacial thermal resistance. In the following stage, the effective thermal conductivity of polycrystalline silicene was investigated considering the effects of grain size and tensile strain. Our results indicate that the average values of Kapitza conductance at grain boundaries at room temperature were estimated nearly 2.56*10^9 W/m2K and 2.46*10^9 W/m2K through utilizing Tersoff and Stillinger-Weber interatomic potentials, respectively. Also, in spite of the mean temperature whose increment does not change Kapitza resistance, the interfacial thermal resistance can be controlled by applying strain. Furthermore, it was found that, by tuning the grain size of polycrystalline silicene, its thermal conductivity can be modulated up to one order of magnitude.",0
"We study thermalization in a one-dimensional quantum system consisting of a noninteracting fermionic chain with each site of the chain coupled to an additional bath site. Using a density matrix renormalization group algorithm we investigate the time evolution of observables in the chain after a quantum quench. For low densities we show that the intermediate time dynamics can be quantitatively described by a system of coupled equations of motion. For higher densities our numerical results show a prethermalization for local observables at intermediate times and a full thermalization to the grand canonical ensemble at long times. For the case of a weak bath-chain coupling we find, in particular, a Fermi momentum distribution in the chain in equilibrium in spite of the seemingly oversimplified bath in our model.",0
"We report the observations of a moderate but relatively intense geo-effective solar eruption on 2015 November 4 from the peripheral diffusive polarities of active region 12443. We use space-borne Solar Dynamics Observatory and ACE observations. EUV images identified helical pattern along a filament channel and we regard this channel as flux-rope structure. Flow velocity derived from tracked magnetograms infers converging motion along the polarity inversion line beneath the filament channel. An associated magnetic cancellation process was detected in the converging region. Further, the pre-eruptive EUV brightening was observed in the converging region, the most intense part of which appeared in the magnetic cancellation region. These observations imply that the converging and cancelling flux probably contributed to the formation of the helical magnetic fields associated with the flux rope. A filament-height estimation method suggests that the middle part of the filament probably lies at a low altitude and was consistent with the initial place of the eruption. A thick current channel associated with the flux rope is also determined. For a expanding thick current channel, the critical height of the decay index for torus instability lies in the range of 37 - 47 Mm. Southward magnetic fields in the sheath and the ejecta induced a geomagnetic storm with a Dst global minimum of ~-90 nT.",0
"We show that with adiabatic passage, one can reliably drive two-photon optical transitions between the ground states and interacting Rydberg states in a pair of atoms. For finite Rydberg interaction strengths a new adiabatic pathway towards the doubly Rydberg excited state is identified when a constant detuning is applied with respect to an intermediate optically excited level. The Rydberg interaction among the excited atoms provides a phase that may be used to implement quantum gate operations on atomic ground state qubits.",0
"We present a class of spline finite element methods for time-domain wave propagation which are particularly amenable to explicit time-stepping. The proposed methods utilize a discontinuous Galerkin discretization to enforce continuity of the solution field across geometric patches in a multi-patch setting, which yields a mass matrix with convenient block diagonal structure. Over each patch, we show how to accurately and efficiently invert mass matrices in the presence of curved geometries by using a weight-adjusted approximation of the mass matrix inverse. This approximation restores a tensor product structure while retaining provable high order accuracy and semi-discrete energy stability. We also estimate the maximum stable timestep for spline-based finite elements and show that the use of spline spaces result in less stringent CFL restrictions than equivalent piecewise continuous or discontinuous finite element spaces. Finally, we explore the use of optimal knot vectors based on L2 n-widths. We show how the use of optimal knot vectors can improve both approximation properties and the maximum stable timestep, and present a simple heuristic method for approximating optimal knot positions. Numerical experiments confirm the accuracy and stability of the proposed methods.",0
"Among the firm predictions of softly broken supersymmetry is the identity of gauge couplings and the corresponding Yukawa couplings between gauginos, sfermions and fermions. In the event that a SUSY-like spectrum of new particles is discovered at future colliders, a key follow-up will be to test these relations experimentally. In detailed studies it has been found that the SUSY-Yukawa couplings of the electroweak sector can be studied with great precision at the ILC, but a similar analysis for the Yukawa coupling of the SUSY-QCD sector is far more challenging. Here a first phenomenological study for determining this coupling is presented, using a method which combines information from LHC and ILC.",0
"Strangeness enhancement has been predicted to be one of the signatures of the formation of the quark gluon plasma (QGP) and event-by-event fluctuations of strangeness may reveal the nature of such a phase transition. We report results for $K/\pi$ fluctuations from Cu+Cu at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 62.4 and 200 GeV and Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 62.4, 130 and 200 GeV using the STAR detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. We compare our results with the results observed in central Pb+Pb collisions at SPS energies at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 6.3, 7.6, 8.8, 12.3, and 17.3 GeV. We observe the fluctuation strength measured at the highest SPS energy point by the NA49 collaboration in Pb+Pb collisions is similar to our results in Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions. We also compare our results with HIJING, a statistical hadronization model and a multi-phase transport model.",0
"The production of nuclear bremsstrahlung photons (E$_{\gamma}>$ 30 MeV) has been studied in inclusive and exclusive measurements in four heavy-ion reactions at 60{\it A} MeV. The measured photon spectra, angular distributions and multiplicities indicate that a significant part of the hard-photons are emitted in secondary nucleon-nucleon collisions from a thermally equilibrated system. The observation of the thermal component in multi-fragment $^{36}$Ar+$^{197}$Au reactions suggests that the breakup of the thermalized source produced in this system occurs on a rather long time-scale.",0
"We give a characterization theorem for non-degenerated plane foliations of degree different from 1 having a rational first integral. Moreover, we prove that the degree $r$ of a non-degenerated foliation as above provides the minimum number, $r+1$, of points in the projective plane through which infinitely many algebraic leaves of the foliation go.",0
"Our motivation in this paper is to take another step forward from complex and heavyweight synchronization protocols to the easy-to-implement and lightweight synchronization protocols in WSNs. To this end, we present GraDeS, a novel multi-hop time synchronization protocol based upon gradient descent algorithm. We give details about our implementation of GraDeS and present its experimental evaluation in our testbed of MICAz sensor nodes. Our observations indicate that GraDeS is scalable, it has identical memory and processing overhead, better convergence time and comparable synchronization performance as compared to existing lightweight solutions.",0
"We classify and explicitly describe homomorphisms of Verma modules for conformal Galilei algebras $\mathfrak{cga}_\ell(d,{\mathbb C})$ with $d=1$ for any integer value $\ell \in \mathbb{N}$. The homomorphisms are uniquely determined by singular vectors as solutions of certain differential operators of flag type, and identified with specific polynomials arising as coefficients in the expansion of a parametric family of symmetric polynomials into power sum symmetric polynomials.",0

"This paper is devoted to the study of the constraint equations of the Lovelock gravity theories. In the case of an empty, compact, conformally flat, time-symmetric, and space-like manifold, we show that the Hamiltonian constraint equation becomes a generalisation of the $\sigma_k$-Yamabe problem. That is to say, the prescription of a linear combination of the $\sigma_k$-curvatures of the manifold. We search solutions in a conformal class for a compact manifold. Using the existing results on the $\sigma_k$-Yamabe problem, we describe some cases in which they can be extended to this new problem. This requires to study the concavity of some polynomial. We do it in two ways: regarding the concavity of an entire root of this polynomial, which is connected to algebraic properties of the polynomial; and seeking analytically a concavifying function. This gives several cases in which a conformal solution exists. At last we show an implicit function theorem in the case of a manifold with negative scalar curvature, and find a conformal solution when the Lovelock theories are close to General Relativity.",0
"Considering the linearized gravity with matter fields, the effective potential of the ``conformal dilaton'' in the string frame is generated semiclassically by one-loop contribution of heavy matter fields. This in turn generates a nontrivial potential for the physical dilaton in the Einstein frame with the trace of the graviton in the Einstein frame gauged away. The remaining manifest local spacetime symmetry is only the volume preserving diffeomorphism symmetry. The consistency of this procedure is examined and the possibility of spontaneous diffeomorphism symmetry breaking is suggested.",0
We develop an analytically solvable model able to qualitatively explain nonhydrogenic exciton spectra observed recently in two-dimensional (2d) semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides. Our exciton Hamiltonian explicitly includes additional angular momentum associated with the pseudospin degree of freedom unavoidable in 2d semiconducting materials with honeycomb structure. We claim that this is the key ingredient for understanding the nonhydrogenic exciton spectra that was missing so far.,0
"Electron-positron pair production by the superposition of two laser pulses with different frequencies and amplitudes is analyzed as a particular realization of the assisted dynamic Schwinger effect. It is demonstrated that, within a non-perturbative kinetic equation framework, an amplification effect is conceivable for certain parameters. When both pulses have wavelengths longer than the Compton wavelength, the residual net density of produced pairs is determined by the resultant field strength. The number of pairs starts to grow rapidly if the wavelength of the high-frequency laser component gets close to the Compton wavelength.",0
"In the 1980's Stallings showed that every finitely generated subgroup of a free group is canonically represented by a finite minimal immersion of a bouquet of circles. In terms of the theory of automata, this is a minimal finite inverse automaton. This allows for the deep algorithmic theory of finite automata and finite inverse monoids to be used to answer questions about finitely generated subgroups of free groups. In this paper we attempt to apply the same methods to other classes of groups. A fundamental new problem is that the Stallings folding algorithm must be modified to allow for ``sewing'' on relations of non-free groups. We look at the class of groups that are amalgams of finite groups. It is known that these groups are locally quasiconvex and thus all finitely generated subgroups are represented by finite automata. We present an algorithm to compute such a finite automaton and use it to solve various algorithmic problems.",0
"Photometric redshifts, which have become the cornerstone of several of the largest astronomical surveys like PanStarrs, DES, J-PAS or the LSST, require precise measurements of galaxy photometry in different bands using a consistent physical aperture. This is not trivial, due to the variation in the shape and width of the Point Spread Function (PSF) introduced by wavelength differences, instrument positions and atmospheric conditions. Current methods to correct for this effect rely on a detailed knowledge of the PSF characteristics as a function of the survey coordinates, which can be difficult due to the relative paucity of stars tracking the PSF behaviour. Here we show that it is possible to measure accurate, consistent multicolour photometry without knowing the shape of PSF. The Chebyshev-Fourier Functions (CHEFs) can fit the observed profile of each object and produce high signal-to-noise integrated flux measurements unaffected by the PSF. These total fluxes, which encompass all the galaxy populations, are much more useful for Galaxy Evolution studies than aperture photometry. We compare the total magnitudes and colours obtained using our software to traditional photometry with SExtractor, using real data from the COSMOS survey and the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. We also apply the CHEFs technique to the recently published Extreme Deep Field and compare the results to those from ColorPro on the HUDF. We produce a photometric catalogue with 35732 sources (10823 with S/N>5), reaching a photometric redshift precision of 2% due to the extraordinary depth and wavelength coverage of the XDF images.",0
"We study the effects of rotation on the growth and saturation of the double-diffusive fingering (thermohaline) instability at low Prandtl number. Using direct numerical simulations, we estimate the compositional transport rates as a function of the relevant non-dimensional parameters - the Rossby number, inversely proportional to the rotation rate, and the density ratio which measures the relative thermal and compositional stratifications. Within our explored range of parameters, we generally find rotation to have little effect on vertical transport. However, we also present one exceptional case where a cyclonic large scale vortex (LSV) is observed at low density ratio and fairly low Rossby number. The LSV leads to significant enhancement in the fingering transport rates by concentrating compositionally dense downflows at its core. We argue that the formation of such LSVs could be relevant to solving the missing mixing problem in RGB stars.",0
"We identify the main actors in the Isabelle and Coq communities and describe how they affect and influence their peers. This work explores selected foundations of social networking analysis that we expect to be useful in the context of the ProofPeer project, which is developing a new model for interactive theorem proving based on collaboration and social interactions.",0
"About 30% to 40% of classical novae produce dust 20-100 days after the outburst, but no presolar stardust grains from classical novae have been unambiguously identified yet. Although several studies claimed a nova paternity for certain grains, the measured and simulated isotopic ratios could only be reconciled assuming that the grains condensed after the nova ejecta mixed with a much larger amount of close-to-solar matter. However, the source and mechanism of this potential post-explosion dilution of the ejecta remains a mystery. A major problem with previous studies is the small number of simulations performed and the implied poor exploration of the large nova parameter space. We report the results of a different strategy, based on a Monte Carlo technique, that involves the random sampling over the most important nova model parameters: the white dwarf composition; the mixing of the outer white dwarf layers with the accreted material before the explosion; the peak temperature and density; the explosion time scales; and the possible dilution of the ejecta after the outburst. We discuss and take into account the systematic uncertainties for both the presolar grain measurements and the simulation results. Only those simulations that are consistent with all measured isotopic ratios of a given grain are accepted for further analysis. We also present the numerical results of the model parameters. We identify 18 presolar grains with measured isotopic signatures consistent with a CO nova origin, without assuming any dilution of the ejecta. Among these, the grains G270 2, M11-334-2, G278, M11-347-4, M11-151-4, and Ag2 6 have the highest probability of a CO nova paternity.",0
"We show that the transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) spectrum of $Z$ boson production measured at Fermilab Tevatron can be well reproduced by leading-order event generators if $Z$ + 1 jet processes are included with a proper solution for the double-count problem and if the parton shower (PS) branch kinematics are defined appropriately. The choice of the PS evolution variable does not definitely determine the low-$p_{T}$ behavior. Our new event generator employing the limited leading-log (LLL) subtraction and a built-in leading-log PS reproduces the spectrum very well, not only in large $p_{T}$ regions but also at low $p_{T}$ down to $p_{T}$ = 0.",0
"The Ryu-Takayanagi formula relates the entanglement entropy in a conformal field theory to the area of a minimal surface in its holographic dual. We show that this relation can be inverted for any state in the conformal field theory to compute the bulk stress-energy tensor near the boundary of the bulk spacetime, reconstructing the local data in the bulk from the entanglement on the boundary. We also show that positivity, monotonicity, and convexity of the relative entropy for small spherical domains between the reduced density matrices of any state and of the ground state of the conformal field theory, follow from positivity conditions on the bulk matter energy density. We discuss an information theoretical interpretation of the convexity in terms of the Fisher metric.",0
"Hole spin relaxation in $p$-type (111) GaAs quantum wells is investigated in the case with only the lowest hole subband, which is heavy-hole like in (111) GaAs/AlAs and light-hole like in (111) GaAs/InP quantum wells, being relevant. The subband L\""""{o}wdin perturbation method is applied to obtain the effective Hamiltonian including the Dresselhaus and Rashba spin-orbit couplings. Under a proper gate voltage, the total in-plane effective magnetic field in (111) GaAs/AlAs quantum wells can be strongly suppressed in the whole momentum space, while the one in (111) GaAs/InP quantum wells can be suppressed only on a special momentum circle. The hole spin relaxation due to the D'yakonov-Perel' and Elliott-Yafet mechanisms is calculated by means of the fully microscopic kinetic spin Bloch equation approach with all the relevant scatterings explicitly included. For (111) GaAs/AlAs quantum wells, extremely long heavy-hole spin relaxation time (upto hundreds of nanoseconds) is predicted. In addition, we predict a pronounced peak in the gate-voltage dependence of the heavy-hole spin relaxation time due to the D'yakonov-Perel' mechanism. This peak origins from the suppression of the unique inhomogeneous broadening in (111) GaAs/AlAs quantum wells. Moreover, the Elliott-Yafet mechanism influences the spin relaxation only around the peak area due to the small spin mixing between the heavy and light holes in quantum wells with small well width. We also show the anisotropy of the spin relaxation. In (111) GaAs/InP quantum wells, a mild peak, similar to the case for electrons in (111) GaAs quantum wells, is also predicted in the gate-voltage dependence of the light-hole spin relaxation time. The contribution of the Elliott-Yafet mechanism is always negligible in this case.",0
"A celebrated theorem of Kleitman in extremal combinatorics states that a collection of binary vectors in $\{0, 1\}^n$ with diameter $d$ has cardinality at most that of a Hamming ball of radius $d/2$. In this paper, we give an algebraic proof of Kleitman's Theorem, by carefully choosing a pseudo-adjacency matrix for certain Hamming graphs, and applying the Cvetkovi\'c bound on independence numbers. This method also allows us to prove several extensions and generalizations of Kleitman's Theorem to other allowed distance sets, in particular blocks of consecutive integers that do not necessarily grow linearly with $n$. We also improve on a theorem of Alon about subsets of $\mathbb{F}_{p}^{n}$ whose difference set does not intersect $\left\{0,1\right\}^{n}$ nontrivially.",0
"There has been a controversial recent claim that the standard result on the Higgs to two photon decay rate is incorrect, with the use of dimensional regularization fingered as the alleged culprit. Given the great importance of the $H\to \gamma \gamma$ process as a possible Standard Model Higgs discovery channel at the LHC if the Higgs mass is light, it is critical to find a way to check the correctness of the results of dimensional regularization for this process. Here we report the results of a perturbative calculation of the $H\to \gamma \gamma$ decay amplitude using a spacetime lattice as a UV regulator, which is the only known gauge-invariant regulator for non-Abelian gauge theories other than dimensional regularization. We find that the decay amplitude calculated using lattice-regularized perturbation theory is consistent to very high statistical accuracy with the decay amplitude obtained using dimensional regularization.",0
"The aim of this manuscript is to discuss the Hilbert-Kunz functions over an excellent local ring regular in codimension one. We study the shape of the Hilbert-Kunz functions of modules and discuss the properties of the coefficient of the second highest term in the function. Our results extend Huneke, McDermott and Monsky's result (Math. Res. Lett. 11 (2004), no. 4, 539-546) about the shape of the Hilbert-Kunz functions, and a theorem of the second author (J. Algebra 304 (2006), no. 1, 487-499) for rings with weaker conditions. In this paper, for a Cohen-Macaulay ring, we also explores an equivalence condition under which the second coefficient vanishes whenever the Hilbert-Kunz function of the ring is considered with respect to an ideal primary to the maximal ideal and of finite projective dimension. We introduce an additive error of the Hilbert-Kunz functions of modules on a short exact sequence and give an estimate of such error.",0
"It is well known that the labeling problems of graphs arise in many (but not limited to) networking and telecommunication contexts. In this paper we introduce the anti-$k$-labeling problem of graphs which we seek to minimize the similarity (or distance) of neighboring nodes. For example, in the fundamental frequency assignment problem in wireless networks where each node is assigned a frequency, it is usually desirable to limit or minimize the frequency gap between neighboring nodes so as to limit interference. Let $k\geq1$ be an integer and $\psi$ is a labeling function (anti-$k$-labeling) from $V(G)$ to $\{1,2,\cdots,k\}$ for a graph $G$. A {\em no-hole anti-$k$-labeling} is an anti-$k$-labeling using all labels between 1 and $k$. We define $w_{\psi}(e)=|\psi(u)-\psi(v)|$ for an edge $e=uv$ and $w_{\psi}(G)=\min\{w_{\psi}(e):e\in E(G)\}$ for an anti-$k$-labeling $\psi$ of the graph $G$. {\em The anti-$k$-labeling number} of a graph $G$, $mc_k(G)$ is $\max\{w_{\psi}(G): \psi\}$. In this paper, we first show that $mc_k(G)=\lfloor \frac{k-1}{\chi-1}\rfloor$, and the problem that determines $mc_k(G)$ of graphs is NP-hard. We mainly obtain the lower bounds on no-hole anti-$n$-labeling number for trees, grids and $n$-cubes.",0
"The dibaryon states as six-quark clusters of exotic QCD states are investigated in this paper. With the inherent nodal surface structure analysis, the wave functions of the six-quark clusters (in another word, the dibaryons) are classified. The contribution of the hidden color channels are discussed. The quantum numbers of the low-lying dibaryon states are obtained. The States $[\Omega\Omega]_{(0,0^{+})}$, $[\Omega\Omega]_{(0,2^{-})}$, $[\Xi^{*}\Omega]_{(1/2,0^{+})}$, $[\Sigma^{*}\Sigma^{*}]_{(0,4^{-})}$ and the hidden color channel states with the same quantum numbers are proposed to be the candidates of dibaryons, which may be observed in experiments.",0
"According to a conjecture recently put forward in arXiv:1806.08362, the scalar potential $V$ of any consistent theory of quantum gravity satisfies a bound $|\nabla V|/V \geq {\cal O}(1)$. This forbids dS solutions and supports quintessence models of cosmic acceleration. Here we point out that in the simplest models incorporating the Standard Model in addition to quintessence, with the two sectors decoupled as suggested by observations, the proposed bound is violated by 50 orders of magnitude. However, a very specific coupling between quintessence and just the Higgs sector may still be allowed and consistent with the conjecture.",0
"In nature adaptive coloration has been effectively utilized for concealment and signaling. Various biological mechanisms have evolved that can tune the reflectivity for visible and ultraviolet light. These examples inspire many artificial systems for mimicking adaptive coloration to match the visual appearance to their surroundings. Thermal camouflage, however, has been an outstanding challenge which requires an ability to control of the emitted thermal radiation from the surface. Here we report a new class of active thermal surfaces capable of efficient real-time electrical-control of thermal emission over the full infrared (IR) spectrum without changing the temperature of the surface. Our approach relies on electro-modulation of IR absorptivity and emissivity of multilayer graphene via reversible intercalation of nonvolatile ionic liquids. The demonstrated devices are light (30 g/m2), thin (<50 um) and ultra-flexible which can conformably coat their environment. In addition, combining active thermal surfaces with a feedback mechanism, we demonstrate realization of an adaptive thermal camouflage system which can reconfigure its thermal appearance and blend itself with the thermal background in a few seconds. Furthermore, we show that these devices can disguise hot objects as cold and cold ones as hot in a thermal imaging system. We anticipate that, the electrical control of thermal radiation will impact on a variety of new technologies ranging from adaptive IR optics to heat management for outer space applications.",0
"The CMS Beam Conditions and Radiation Monitoring System, BRM, will support beam tuning, protect the CMS detector from adverse beam conditions, and measure the accumulated dose close to or inside all sub-detectors. It is composed of different sub-systems measuring either the particle flux near the beam pipe with time resolution between nano- and microseconds or the integrated dose over longer time intervals. This paper presents the Fast Beam Conditions Monitor, BCM1F, which is designed for fast flux monitoring measuring both beam halo and collision products. BCM1F is located inside the CMS pixel detector volume close to the beam-pipe. It uses sCVD diamond sensors and radiation hard front-end electronics, along with an analog optical readout of the signals. The commissioning of the system and its successful operation during the first be ams of the LHC are described.",0
"Supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei show a close relationship between the black hole mass, luminosity, and stellar velocity dispersion (sigma_*) of the host galaxy bulge. Probing these relationships at high redshift may shed light on the link between the formation of the galactic bulge and central black hole, but direct measurements of stellar velocity dispersion at high redshift are difficult. We show that [OIII] line widths provide a useful surrogate for sigma_* by comparing sigma_[OIII] with the value of sigma_* predicted by the Faber-Jackson relation for QSOs with measured host galaxy luminosity. Over a wide range of AGN luminosity, sigma_[OIII] tracks sigma_*, albeit with considerable scatter. [OIII] line widths are narrower by ~0.1 dex in radio-loud QSOs than in radio-quiet QSOs of similar host luminosity. In low redshift QSOs, the ratio of star formation rate to black hole growth rate is much smaller than the typical ratio of bulge mass to black hole mass.",0
"We study localization effects of disorder on the spectral and dynamical properties of Schroedinger operators with random potentials. The new results include exponentially decaying bounds on the transition amplitude and related projection kernels, including in the mean. These are derived through the analysis of fractional moments of the resolvent, which are finite due to the resonance-diffusing effects of the disorder. The main difficulty which has up to now prevented an extension of this method to the continuum can be traced to the lack of a uniform bound on the Lifshitz-Krein spectral shift associated with the local potential terms. The difficulty is avoided here through the use of a weak-L1 estimate concerning the boundary-value distribution of resolvents of maximally dissipative operators, combined with standard tools of relative compactness theory.",0
"For a class of density functions $q^n(x^n)$ on $\Bbb R^n$ we prove an inequality between relative entropy and the sum of average conditional relative entropies of the following form: For any density function $p^n(x^n)$ on $\Bbb R^n$, $D(p^n||q^n)\leq Const. \sum_{i=1}^n \Bbb E D(p_i(\cdot|Y_1,..., Y_{i-1},Y_{i+1},..., Y_n) || Q_i(\cdot|Y_1,..., Y_{i-1},Y_{i+1},..., Y_n)),$ where $p_i(\cdot|y_1,..., y_{i-1},y_{i+1},..., y_n)$ and $Q_i(\cdot|x_1,..., x_{i-1},x_{i+1},..., x_n)$ denote the local specifications for $p^n$ resp. $q^n$, i.e., the conditional density functions of the $i$'th coordinate, given the other coordinates. The constant depends on the properties of the local specifications of $q^n$. The above inequality implies a logarithmic Sobolev inequality for $q^n$. We get an explicit lower bound for the logarithmic Sobolev constant of $q^n$ under the assumptions that: (i) the local specifications of $q^n$ satisfy logarithmic Sobolev inequalities with constants $\rho_i$, and (ii) they also satisfy some condition expressing that the mixed partial derivatives of the Hamiltonian of $q^n$ are not too large relative to the logarithmic Sobolev constants $\rho_i$.

"Suppose $L=-\Delta+V$ is a Schr\""""odinger operator on $\mathbb{R}^n$ with a potential $V$ belonging to certain reverse H\""""older class $RH_\sigma$ with $\sigma\geq n/2$. The main aim of this paper is to provide necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of $T1$ criteria for a generalised Calder\'on--Zygmund type operator with respect to $L$ to be bounded on Hardy spaces $H^p_L(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and on BMO type spaces BMO$_L^\alpha(\mathbb{R}^n)$ associated with $L$. As applications, we prove the boundedness for several singular integral operators associated to $L$. Our approach is flexible enough to prove the boundedness of the Riesz transforms related to $L$ with $n/2 \leq \sigma <n$ which were investigated in \cite{MSTZ} under the stronger condition $\sigma\geq n$. Thus our results not only recover existing results in \cite{MSTZ} but also contains new results in literature.",0
"The manifestly gauge invariant formulation for free symmetric partially massless fields in $(A)dS_d$ is given in terms of gauge connections and linearized curvatures that take values in the irreducible representations of $(o(d-1,2)) o(d,1)$ described by two-row Young tableaux, in which the lengths of the first and second row are, respectively, associated with spin and depth of partial masslessness.",0
"We introduce and study, for a process P delivering edges on the Cartesian product of the vertex sets of a given set of graphs, the P-product of these graphs, thereby generalizing many types of product graph. Analogous to the notion of a multilinear map (from linear algebra), a P-morphism is introduced and utilised to define a P-tensor product of graphs, after which its uniqueness is demonstrated. Congruences of graphs are utilised to show a way to handle projections (being weak homomorphisms) in this context. Finally, the graph of a homomorphism and a P-tensor product of homomorphisms are introduced, studied, and linked to the P-tensor product of graphs.",0
"We use three dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations to study the structure of the boundary layer between an accretion disc and a non-rotating, unmagnetized star. Under the assumption that cooling is efficient, we obtain a narrow but highly variable transition region in which the radial velocity is only a small fraction of the sound speed. A large fraction of the energy dissipation occurs in high density gas adjacent to the hydrostatic stellar envelope, and may therefore be reprocessed and largely hidden from view of the observer. As suggested by Pringle (1989), the magnetic field energy in the boundary layer is strongly amplified by shear, and exceeds that in the disc by an order of magnitude. These fields may play a role in generating the magnetic activity, X-ray emission, and outflows in disc systems where the accretion rate is high enough to overwhelm the stellar magnetosphere.",0
"Scene parsing is challenging as it aims to assign one of the semantic categories to each pixel in scene images. Thus, pixel-level features are desired for scene parsing. However, classification networks are dominated by the discriminative portion, so directly applying classification networks to scene parsing will result in inconsistent parsing predictions within one instance and among instances of the same category. To address this problem, we propose two transform units to learn pixel-level consensus features. One is an Instance Consensus Transform (ICT) unit to learn the instance-level consensus features by aggregating features within the same instance. The other is a Category Consensus Transform (CCT) unit to pursue category-level consensus features through keeping the consensus of features among instances of the same category in scene images. The proposed ICT and CCT units are lightweight, data-driven and end-to-end trainable. The features learned by the two units are more coherent in both instance-level and category-level. Furthermore, we present the Consensus Feature Network (CFNet) based on the proposed ICT and CCT units. Experiments on four scene parsing benchmarks, including Cityscapes, Pascal Context, CamVid, and COCO Stuff, show that the proposed CFNet learns pixel-level consensus feature and obtain consistent parsing results.",0
"The pure spinor formalism for the superstring has recently been used to compute massless four-point two-loop amplitudes in a manifestly super-Poincare covariant manner. In this paper, we show that when all four external states are Neveu-Schwarz, the two-loop amplitude coincides with the RNS result.",0
"We consider approximation problems for a special space of d variate functions. We show that the problems have small number of active variables, as it has been postulated in the past using concentration of measure arguments. We also show that, depending on the norm for measuring the error, the problems are strongly polynomially or quasi-polynomially tractable even in the model of computation where functional evaluations have the cost exponential in the number of active variables.",0
"Screening of topological charges (singularities) is discussed for paraxial optical fields with short and with long range correlations. For short range screening the charge variance in a circular region with radius $R$ grows linearly with $R$, instead of with $R^{2}$ as expected in the absence of screening; for long range screening it grows faster than $R$: for a field whose autocorrelation function is the zero order Bessel function J_{0}, the charge variance grows as R ln R$. A J_{0} correlation function is not attainable in practice, but we show how to generate an optical field whose correlation function closely approximates this form. The charge variance can be measured by counting positive and negative singularities inside the region A, or more easily by counting signed zero crossings on the perimeter of A. \For the first method the charge variance is calculated by integration over the charge correlation function C(r), for the second by integration over the zero crossing correlation function Gamma(r). Using the explicit forms of C(r) and of Gamma(r) we show that both methods of calculation yield the same result. We show that for short range screening the zero crossings can be counted along a straight line whose length equals P, but that for long range screening this simplification no longer holds. We also show that for realizable optical fields, for sufficiently small R, the charge variance goes as R^2, whereas for sufficiently large R, it grows as R. These universal laws are applicable to both short and pseudo-long range correlation functions.",0
"We continue to develop our neural network (NN) based forecasting approach to anomaly detection (AD) using the Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) industrial control system (ICS) testbed dataset. We propose genetic algorithms (GA) to find the best NN architecture for a given dataset, using the NAB metric to assess the quality of different architectures. The drawbacks of the F1-metric are analyzed. Several techniques are proposed to improve the quality of AD: exponentially weighted smoothing, mean p-powered error measure, individual error weight for each variable, disjoint prediction windows. Based on the techniques used, an approach to anomaly interpretation is introduced.",0
"We examine cosmological perturbations in a dynamical theory of inflation in which an Abelian gauge field couples directly to the inflaton, breaking conformal invariance. When the coupling between the gauge field and the inflaton takes a specific form, inflation becomes anisotropic and anisotropy can persist throughout inflation, avoiding Wald's no-hair theorem. After discussing scenarios in which anisotropy can persist during inflation, we calculate the dominant effects of a small persistent anisotropy on the primordial gravitational wave and curvature perturbation power spectra using the """"in-in"""" formalism of perturbation theory. We find that the primordial power spectra of cosmological perturbations gain significant direction dependence and that the fractional direction dependence of the tensor power spectrum is suppressed in comparison to that of the scalar power spectrum.",0
The slope conjecture gives a precise relation between the degree of the colored Jones polynomial of a knot and the boundary slopes of essential surfaces in the knot complement. In this note we propose a generalization of the slope conjecture to links. We prove the conjecture for all alternating and more generally adequate links. We also verify the conjecture for torus links.,0
"We present the analysis of one week of single-site high-speed CCD photometric observations of the cool ZZ Ceti star HS 0507+0434B. Ten independent frequencies are detected in the star's light variations: one singlet and three nearly-equally spaced triplets. We argue that these triplets are due to rotationally split modes of spherical degree l=1. This is the first detection of consistent multiplet structure in the amplitude spectrum of a cool ZZ Ceti star and it allows us to determine the star's rotation period: 1.70 +/- 0.11 d. We report exactly equal frequency, not period, spacings between the detected mode groups. In addition, certain pairs of modes from the four principal groups have frequency ratios which are very close to 3:4 or 4:5; while these ratios are nearly exact (within one part in 10^4), they still lie outside the computed error bars. We speculate that these relationships between different frequencies could be caused by resonances. One of the three triplets may not be constant in amplitude and/or frequency. We compare our frequency solution for the combination frequencies (of which we detected 38) to Wu's (1998, 2001) model thereof. We obtain consistent results when trying to infer the star's convective thermal time and the inclination angle of its rotational axis. Theoretical combination-frequency amplitude spectra also resemble those of the observations well, and direct theoretical predictions of the observed second-order light-curve distortions were also reasonably successful assuming the three triplets are due to l=1 modes. Attempts to reproduce the observed combination frequencies adopting all possible l=2 identifications for the triplets did not provide similarly consistent results, supporting their identification with l=1.",0
We report our progress constructing a fixed-point action for fermions interacting with SU(3) gauge fields.,0
"The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond allows room-temperature wide-field quantum magnetometry and metrology for a small volume, which is an important technology for applications in biology. Although coherence of the NV center has a limited frequency resolution of diamond magnetometry to 10-100 kHz, recent studies have shown that a phase sensitive protocol can beat the coherence limit on a confocal setup. Here, we report a new measurement protocol, """"iQdyne,"""" for improving the frequency resolution of wide-field imaging beyond the coherence limit of the NV center. We demonstrate wide-field magnetometry with a frequency resolution of 238 mHz and a magnetic sensitivity of 65 nT/sqrtHz, which are superior to the conventional XY8-based technique, which paves the way to in vivo microscale nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. We find that the experimental performance of iQdyne agrees well with that of an analytical model.",0
"We study gauge theories with/without an extra dimension at finite temperature, in which there are two kinds of order parameters of gauge symmetry breaking. The one is the zero mode of the gauge field for the Euclidean time direction and the other is that for the direction of the extra dimension. We evaluate the effective potential for the zero modes in one-loop approximation and investigate the vacuum configuration in detail. Our analyses show that gauge symmetry can be broken only through the zero mode for the direction of the extra dimension and no nontrivial vacuum configuration of the zero mode for the Euclidean time direction is found.",0
"The SU(n) symmetric antiferromagnetic finite chain with the fundamental representation and nearest-neighbor interaction is studied. A partial ordering between the lowest energy levels e(Y) in multiplet sectors corresponding to different Young tableaux Y is established for the chains with arbitrary site-dependent couplings. For the open chains it is proved that e(Y1)>e(Y2) if Y2 may be obtained from Y1 moving down some of its boxes. In particular, the ground state of the chain belongs to the antisymmetric multiplet sector. For the rings the same condition is fulfilled if, in addition, all rows of Y2 are of even or odd length. The ground state is SU(n) singlet if the chain's length is a multiple of n both for open and periodic chains. The results generalize the well known Lieb-Mattis theorem to chains with higher symmetries.",0
"In this paper, we use the 'Quasi Normal Modes' (QNM) approach for discussing the transmission properties of double-side opened optical cavities: in particular, this approach is specified for one dimensional (1D) 'Photonic Band Gap' (PBG) structures. Moreover, we conjecture that the density of the modes (DOM) is a dynamical variable which has the flexibility of varying with respect to the boundary conditions as well as the initial conditions; in fact, the e.m. field generated by two monochromatic counter-propagating pump waves leads to interference effects inside a quarter-wave (QW) symmetric 1D-PBG structure. Finally, here, for the first time, a large number of theoretical assumptions on QNM metrics for an open cavity, never discussed in literature, are proved, and a simple and direct method to calculate the QNM norm for a 1D-PBG structure is reported.",0
"We investigate entangled qudits evolving under random, local $SU(d)$ operations and demonstrate that this evolution is constrained by intrinsic bounds, showing robust features of two-qudit entangled states that can be useful for fault tolerant implementations of phase gates. Our analytical results are supported by numerical simulations and confirmed by experiments on liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance qubits.",0
"About 40% of the observation time of the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) is dedicated to studying active galactic nuclei (AGN), with the aim of increasing the sample of known extragalactic very-high-energy (VHE, E>100 GeV) sources and constraining the physical processes at play in potential emitters. H.E.S.S. observations of AGN, spanning a period from April 2004 to December 2011, are investigated to constrain their gamma-ray fluxes. Only the 47 sources without significant excess detected at the position of the targets are presented. Upper limits on VHE fluxes of the targets were computed and a search for variability was performed on the nightly time scale. For 41 objects, the flux upper limits we derived are the most constraining reported to date. These constraints at VHE are compared with the flux level expected from extrapolations of Fermi-LAT measurements in the two-year catalog of AGN. The H.E.S.S. upper limits are at least a factor of two lower than the extrapolated Fermi-LAT fluxes for 11 objects. Taking into account the attenuation by the extragalactic background light reduces the tension for all but two of them, suggesting intrinsic curvature in the high-energy spectra of these two AGN. Compilation efforts led by current VHE instruments are of critical importance for target-selection strategies before the advent of the Cherenkov Telescope Array, CTA.",0
"In a recent article in PNAS, Case and Deaton show a figure illustrating """"a marked increase in the all-cause mortality of middle-aged white non-Hispanic men and women in the United States between 1999 and 2013."""" The authors state that their numbers """"are not age-adjusted within the 10-y 45-54 age group."""" They calculated the mortality rate each year by dividing the total number of deaths for the age group by the population of the age group. We suspected an aggregation bias. After adjusting for changes in age composition, we find there is no longer a steady increase in mortality rates for this age group. Instead there is an increasing trend from 1999-2005 and a constant trend thereafter. Moreover, stratifying age-adjusted mortality rates by sex shows a marked increase only for women and not men, contrary to the article's headline. We stress that this does not change a key finding of the Case and Deaton paper: the comparison of non-Hispanic U.S. middle-aged whites to other countries and other ethnic groups. These comparisons hold up after our age adjustment. While we do not believe that age-adjustment invalidates comparisons between countries, it does affect claims concerning the absolute increase in mortality among U.S. middle-aged white non-Hispanics. Breaking down the trends in this group by region of the country shows other interesting patterns: since 1999 there has been an increase in death rates among women in the south. In contrast, death rates for both sexes have been declining in the northeast, the region where mortality rates were lowest to begin with. These graphs demonstrate the value of this sort of data exploration, and we are grateful to Case and Deaton for focusing attention on these mortality trends.",0
"A $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric nonlinear Schr\""""odinger dimer is a two-site discrete nonlinear Schr\""""odinger equation with one site losing and the other one gaining energy at the same rate. In this paper, two four-parameter families of cubic $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric dimers are constructed as gain-loss extensions of their conservative, Hamiltonian, counterparts. We prove that all these damped-driven equations define completely integrable Hamiltonian systems. The second aim of our study is to identify nonlinearities that give rise to the spontaneous $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry restoration. When the symmetry of the underlying linear dimer is broken and an unstable small perturbation starts to grow, the nonlinear coupling of the required type diverts progressively large amounts of energy from the gaining to the losing site. As a result, the exponential growth is saturated and all trajectories remain trapped in a finite part of the phase space regardless of the value of the gain-loss coefficient.",0
"In this note, we consider M-curves of odd degree with real scheme of the form $< \mathcal{J} \amalg \alpha \amalg 1 < \beta > >$. With help of complex orientations, we prove that for $m = 9$, $\alpha \geq 2$, and for $m = 11$, $\alpha \geq 3$.",0
"We discuss a possible interpretation of the open charm mesons $D_{s0}^*(2317)$, $D_{s1}(2460)$ and the hidden charm mesons X(3872), Y(3940) and Y(4140) as hadron molecules. Using a phenomenological Lagrangian approach we review the strong and radiative decays of the $D_{s0}^* (2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ states. The X(3872) is assumed to consist dominantly of molecular hadronic components with an additional small admixture of a charmonium configuration. Determing the radiative ($\gamma J/\psi$ and $\gamma \psi(2s)$) and strong ($J/\psi 2\pi $ and $ J/\psi 3\pi$) decay modes we show that present experimental observation is consistent with the molecular structure assumption of the X(3872). Finally we give evidence for molecular interpretations of the Y(3940) and Y(4140) related to the observed strong decay modes $J/\psi + \omega$ or $J/\psi + \phi$, respectively.",0
"We present the technical details of the gamma-ray burst (GRB) alert system of the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT) at Lick Observatory, and the successful observations of the GRB 020813 optical afterglow with this system. KAIT responds to GRB alerts robotically, interrupts its pre-arranged program, and takes a sequence of images for each GRB alert. A grid-imaging procedure is used to increase the efficiency of the early-time observations. Different sequences of images have been developed for different types of GRB alerts. With relatively fast telescope slew and CCD readout speed, KAIT can typically complete the first observation within 60 s after receiving a GRB alert, reaching a limiting magnitude of $\sim 19$. Our reduction of the GRB 020813 data taken with KAIT shows that unfiltered magnitudes can be reliably transformed to a standard passband with a precision of $\sim$5%, given that the color of the object is known. The GRB 020813 optical afterglow has an exceptionally slow early-time power-law decay index, though other light-curve parameters and the optical spectral index are fairly typical of GRBs.",0
An analysis is presented of wave-vector dispersion in elliptically birefringent stratified magneto-optic media having one-dimensional periodicity. It is found that local normal-mode polarization-state differences between adjacent layers lead to mode coupling and impact the wave-vector dispersion and the character of the Bloch states of the system. This coupling produces extra terms in the dispersion relation not present in uniform circularly birefringent magneto-optic stratified media. Normal mode coupling lifts the degeneracy at frequency band cross-over points under certain conditions and induces a magnetization-dependent optical band gap. This study examines the conditions for band gap formation in the system. It shows that such a frequency-split can be characterized by a simple coupling parameter that depends on the relation between polarization states of local normal modes in adjacent layers. The character of the Bloch states and conditions for maximizing the strength of the band splitting in these systems are analyzed.,0
"Mathematics is usually regarded as a kind of language. The essential behavior of physical phenomena can be expressed by mathematical laws, providing descriptions and predictions. In the present essay I argue that, although mathematics can be seen, in a first approach, as a language, it goes beyond this concept. I conjecture that mathematics presents two extreme features, denoted here by {\sl irreducibility} and {\sl insaturation}, representing delimiters for self-referentiality. These features are then related to physical laws by realizing that nature is a self-referential system obeying bounds similar to those respected by mathematics. Self-referential systems can only be autonomous entities by a kind of metabolism that provides and sustains such an autonomy. A rational mind, able of consciousness, is a manifestation of the self-referentiality of the Universe. Hence mathematics is here proposed to go beyond language by actually representing the most fundamental existence condition for self-referentiality. This idea is synthesized in the form of a principle, namely, that {\sl mathematics is the ultimate tactics of self-referential systems to mimic themselves}. That is, well beyond an effective language to express the physical world, mathematics uncovers a deep manifestation of the autonomous nature of the Universe, wherein the human brain is but an instance.",0
"Following a suggestion by Vafa, we present a quantum-mechanical model for S-duality symmetries observed in the quantum theories of fields, strings and branes. Our formalism may be understood as the topological limit of Berezin's metric quantisation of the upper half-plane H, in that the metric dependence has been removed. Being metric-free, our prescription makes no use of global quantum numbers. Quantum numbers arise only locally, after the choice of a local vacuum to expand around. Our approach may be regarded as a manifestly non perturbative formulation of quantum mechanics, in that we take no classical phase space and no Poisson brackets as a starting point. The reparametrisation invariance of H under SL(2,R) induces a natural SL(2,R) action on the quantum mechanical operators that implements S-duality. We also link our approach with the equivalence principle of quantum mechanics recently formulated by Faraggi and Matone.",0
"Performing smart computations in a context of cloud computing and big data is highly appreciated today. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) is a smart category of encryption schemes that allows working with the data in its encrypted form. It permits us to preserve confidentiality of our sensible data and to benefit from cloud computing powers. Currently, it has been demonstrated by many existing schemes that the theory is feasible but the efficiency needs to be dramatically improved in order to make it usable for real applications. One subtle difficulty is how to efficiently handle the noise. This paper aims to introduce an efficient and verifiable FHE based on a new mathematic structure that is noise free.",0
Loop groups G as families of mappings of the complex manifold M into another complex manifold N preserving marked points $s_0\in M$ and $y_0\in N$ are investigated. Quasi-invariant measures $\mu $ on G relative to dense subgroups $G'$ are constructed. These measures are used for the studying of irreducible representations of such groups.,0
"Von Neumann's original proof of the ergodic theorem is revisited. A convergence rate is established under the assumption that one can control the density of the spectrum of the underlying self-adjoint operator when restricted to suitable subspaces. Explicit rates are obtained when the bound is polynomial or logarithmic, with applications to the linear Schr\""""odinger and wave equations. In particular, decay estimates for time-averages of solutions are shown.",0
"Many deep learning-based speech enhancement algorithms are designed to minimize the mean-square error (MSE) in some transform domain between a predicted and a target speech signal. However, optimizing for MSE does not necessarily guarantee high speech quality or intelligibility, which is the ultimate goal of many speech enhancement algorithms. Additionally, only little is known about the impact of the loss function on the emerging class of time-domain deep learning-based speech enhancement systems. We study how popular loss functions influence the performance of deep learning-based speech enhancement systems. First, we demonstrate that perceptually inspired loss functions might be advantageous if the receiver is the human auditory system. Furthermore, we show that the learning rate is a crucial design parameter even for adaptive gradient-based optimizers, which has been generally overlooked in the literature. Also, we found that waveform matching performance metrics must be used with caution as they in certain situations can fail completely. Finally, we show that a loss function based on scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) achieves good general performance across a range of popular speech enhancement evaluation metrics, which suggests that SI-SDR is a good candidate as a general-purpose loss function for speech enhancement systems.",0
We discuss the prospects for parity non-conservation experiments with highly charged heavy ions. Energy levels and parity mixing for heavy ions with two to five electrons are calculated.

"The dark matter constraint imposed by the recent WMAP experiment on gravitational theories is analyzed. Using the non-linearity of the vacuum Einstein's equations, it is shown that when the slow motion condition is applied to the geodesic equations, the resulting nearly Newtonian gravitational field describes nearly flat velocity curves for rotating stars in the vicinity of thin disk galaxies.",0
"We argue that X-ray flaring variability observed in the transient X-ray pulsar A 0535+26 is due to low-mode magnetospheric instability. This instability develops at the onset of accretion, in the thin boundary layer between the accretion disk and neutron star magnetosphere. As a result, the matter collected in the boundary layer can rapidly fall onto the NS surface close to the magnetic poles, but not exactly along the field lines by which the stationary accretion proceeds. This explains the shift in cyclotron line energy measured using RXTE data in a pre-outburst spike, with respect to the line energy observed during the main outburst. Furthermore, the instability can account for the difference in pulse profiles, and their energy evolution that is different in the pre-outburst flare and main outburst.",0
"DC and finite frequency transport measurements of thin films of amorphous indium oxide that were driven through the critical point of superconductor-insulator transition by the application of perpendicular magnetic field are presented. The observation of non-monotonic dependence of resistance on magnetic field in the insulating phase, novel transport characteristics near the resistance peak and finite superfluid stiffness in the insulating phase are all discussed from the point of view that suggests a possible relation between the conduction mechanisms in the superconducting and insulating phases. The results are summarized in the form of an experimental phase diagram for disordered superconductors in the disorder-magnetic field plane.",0
"We construct for the first time a flavor model, based on the smallest discrete symmetry Delta(27) that implements spontaneous CP violation with a complex phase of geometric origin, which can actually reproduce all quark masses and mixing data.

"Kolyvagin proved that the Tate-Shafarevich group of an elliptic curve over Q of analytic rank 0 or 1 is finite, and that its algebraic rank is equal to its analytic rank.

We prove some steps of this program, mainly for quotients of $H^7$ of Siegel sixfolds. For example, we """"almost"""" find analogs of Kolyvagin's trace and reduction relations. Some steps of the present paper are new contribution, because they have no analogs in the case of elliptic curves. There are still a number of large gaps in the program. The most important of these gaps is a high-dimensional analog of a result of Zagier about ratios of Heegner points corresponding to different imaginary quadratic fields on a fixed elliptic curve. The author suggests to the readers to continue these investigations.",0
"In this work, a minisuperspace model for the projectable Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity without the detailed balance condition is investigated. The Wheeler-deWitt equation is derived and its solutions are studied and discussed for some particular cases where, due to HL gravity, there is a """"potential barrier"""" nearby $a=0$. For a vanishing cosmological constant, it is found a normalizable wave function of the universe. When the cosmological constant is non-vanishing, the WKB method is used to obtain solutions for the wave function of the universe. Using the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, one discusses how the transition from quantum to classical regime occurs and, for the case of a positive cosmological constant, the scale factor is shown to grow exponentially, hence recovering the GR behaviour for the late universe.",0
"The investigation of 2D van der Waals (vdW) materials is a vibrant, fast moving and still growing interdisciplinary area of research. 2D vdW materials are truly 2D crystals with strong covalent in-plane bonds and weak van der Waals interaction between the layers with a variety of different electronic, optical and mechanical properties. A very prominent class of 2D materials are transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and amongst them particularly the semiconducting subclass. Their properties include bandgaps in the near-infrared to the visible range, decent charge carrier mobility together with high (photo-)catalytic and mechanical stability and exotic many body phenomena. These characteristics make the materials highly attractive for both fundamental research as well as innovative device applications. Furthermore, the materials exhibit a strong light matter interaction providing a high sun light absorbance of up to 15% in the monolayer limit, strong scattering cross section in Raman experiments and access to excitonic phenomena in vdW heterostructures. This review focuses on the light matter interaction in MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, and WSe2 that is dictated by the materials complex dielectric functions and on the multiplicity of studying the first order phonon modes by Raman spectroscopy to gain access to several material properties such as doping, strain, defects and temperature. 2D materials provide an interesting platform to stack them into vdW heterostructures without the limitation of lattice mismatch resulting in novel devices for application but also to study exotic many body interaction phenomena such as interlayer excitons. Future perspectives of semiconducting TMDs and their heterostructures for applications in optoelectronic devices will be examined and routes to study emergent fundamental problems and many-body quantum phenomena under excitations with photons will be discussed.",0
"The atmospheric attenuation of Cherenkov photons is dominated by two processes: Rayleigh scattering from the molecular component and Mie scattering from the aerosol component. Aerosols are expected to contribute up to 30 Wm$^{-2}$ to the emission profile of the atmosphere, equivalent to a difference of ~20C to the clear sky brightness temperature under normal conditions. Here we investigate the aerosol contribution of the measured sky brightness temperature at the H.E.S.S. site; compare it to effective changes in the telescope trigger rates; and discuss how it can be used to provide an assessment of sky clarity that is unambiguously free of telescope systematics.",0
"The loss of contrast in double-slit electron-diffraction due to dephasing and decoherence processes is studied. It is shown that the spatial correlation function of diffraction patterns can be used to distinguish between dephasing and decoherence. This establishes a measure of time-reversibility that does not require the determination of coherence terms of the density matrix, while von Neumann entropy, another measure of time-reversibility, does require coherence terms. This technique is exciting in view of the need to understand and control the detrimental experimental effects of contrast loss and for fundamental studies on the transition from the classical to the quantum regime.",0
"From the paper """"Formality Conjecture"""" (Ascona 1996): """"I am aware of only one such a class, it corresponds to simplest good graph, the complete graph with $4$ vertices $($and $6$ edges$)$.

We show how to associate a differential graded Lie algebra to every differential graded Lie group and vice-versa. For the DGLA $\to$ DGLG direction, the main ``tools'' are graded Hopf algebras and Harish-Chandra pairs (HCP) -- we define the category of graded and differential graded HCPs and explain how those are related to the desired construction. We describe some near at hand examples and mention possible generalizations.",0
"We have computed the galactic trajectories of twelve hypervelocity stars (HVSs) under the assumption that they originated in the Galactic Centre. We show that eight of these twelve stars are bound to the Galaxy. We consider the subsequent trajectories of the bound stars to compute their characteristic orbital period, which is 2 Gyr. All eight bound stars are moving away from the centre of the Galaxy, which implies that the stars' lifetimes are less than 2 Gyr. We thus infer that the observed HVSs are massive main sequence stars, rather than blue horizontal branch stars. The observations suggest that blue HVSs are ejected from the Galactic Centre roughly every 15 Myr. This is consistent with the observed population of blue stars in extremely tight orbits round the central super-massive black hole (SMBH), the so-called S-stars, if we assume that the HVSs are produced by the breakup of binaries. One of the stars in such a binary is ejected at high velocities to form a HVS; the other remains bound to the SMBH as an S-star. We further show that the one high-velocity system observed to be moving towards the Galactic Centre, SDSS J172226.55+594155.9, could not have originated in the Galactic Centre; rather, we identify it as a halo object.",0
"We develop a theory for interlayer tunneling in van der Waals heterostructures driven under a strong electromagnetic field, using graphene/{\it h}-BN/graphene as a paradigmatic example. Our theory predicts that strong anti-resonances appear at bias voltage values equal to an integer multiple of the light frequency. These features are found to originate from photon-assisted resonant tunneling transitions between Floquet sidebands of different graphene layers, and are unique to two-band systems due to the interplay of both intraband and interband tunneling transitions. Our results point to the possibility of tunneling localization in van der Waals heterostructures using strong electromagnetic fields.",0
"One of the most fundamental features of a black hole in general relativity is its event horizon: a boundary from which nothing can escape. There has been a recent surge of interest in the nature of these event horizons and their local neighbourhoods. In an attempt to resolve black hole information paradox(es), and more generally, to better understand the path towards quantum gravity, """"firewalls"""" have been proposed as an alternative to black hole event horizons. In this paper, we explore the phenomenological implications of black holes possessing a surface or """"firewall"""", and predict a potentially detectable signature of these firewalls in the form of a high energy astrophysical neutrino flux. We compute the spectrum of this neutrino flux in different models and show that it is a possible candidate for the source of the PeV neutrinos recently detected by IceCube. This opens up a new area of research, bridging the non-perturbative physics of quantum gravity with the observational black hole and high energy astrophysics.",0
"We consider Anzellotti-type almost minimizers for the thin obstacle (or Signorini) problem with zero thin obstacle and establish their $C^{1,\beta}$ regularity on the either side of the thin manifold, the optimal growth away from the free boundary, the $C^{1,\gamma}$ regularity of the regular part of the free boundary, as well as a structural theorem for the singular set. The analysis of the free boundary is based on a successful adaptation of energy methods such as a one-parameter family of Weiss-type monotonicity formulas, Almgren-type frequency formula, and the epiperimetric and logarithmic epiperimetric inequalities for the solutions of the thin obstacle problem.",0
"We consider Dirac-supersymmetric interactions, which produce CP-conserving separation of positive and negative energy solutions in the Dirac equation in order to investigate an alternative to the Kaluza-Klein mechanism. We review conditions under which separation is possible into free particle and compactified behaviors in different dimensions, with attention to spin degrees of freedom. We show a U(1) constant magnetic field produces such kind of behavior; an explicit treatment is given to the 6-d to 4-d and 4-d to 2-d breaking cases and the spectrum is obtained. A dynamical mass-creation mechanism is suggested from the procedure.",0
"Weakly Supervised Object Localization (WSOL) methodsusually rely on fully convolutional networks in order to ob-tain class activation maps(CAMs) of targeted labels. How-ever, these networks always highlight the most discriminativeparts to perform the task, the located areas are much smallerthan entire targeted objects. In this work, we propose a novelend-to-end model to enlarge CAMs generated from classifi-cation models, which can localize targeted objects more pre-cisely. In detail, we add an additional module in traditionalclassification networks to extract foreground object propos-als from images without classifying them into specific cate-gories. Then we set these normalized regions as unrestrictedpixel-level mask supervision for the following classificationtask. We collect a set of images defined as Background ImageSet from the Internet. The number of them is much smallerthan the targeted dataset but surprisingly well supports themethod to extract foreground regions from different pictures.The region extracted is independent from classification task,where the extracted region in each image covers almost en-tire object rather than just a significant part. Therefore, theseregions can serve as masks to supervise the response mapgenerated from classification models to become larger andmore precise. The method achieves state-of-the-art results onCUB-200-2011 in terms of Top-1 and Top-5 localization er-ror while has a competitive result on ILSVRC2016 comparedwith other approaches.",0
"We use the free entropy defined by D. Voiculescu to prove that the free group factors can not be decomposed as closed linear spans of noncommutative monomials in elements of nonprime subfactors or abelian $*$-subalgebras, if the degrees of monomials have an upper bound depending on the number of generators. The resulting estimates for the hyperfinite and abelian dimensions of free group factors settle in the affirmative a conjecture of L. Ge and S. Popa (for infinitely many generators).",0
"We consider the cascade and triangular rate-distortion problem where side information is known to the source encoder and to the first user but not to the second user. We characterize the rate-distortion region for these problems. For the quadratic Gaussian case, we show that it is sufficient to consider jointly Gaussian distributions, a fact that leads to an explicit solution.",0
"Introduced is a lattice-gas with long-range 2-body interactions. An effective inter-particle force is mediated by momentum exchanges. There exists the possibility of having both attractive and repulsive interactions using finite impact parameter collisions. There also exists an interesting possibility of coupling these long-range interactions to a heat bath. A fixed temperature heat bath induces a permanent net attractive interparticle potential, but at the expense of reversibility. Thus the long-range dynamics is a kind of a Monte Carlo Kawasaki updating scheme. The model has a $P\rho T$ equation of state. Presented are analytical and numerical results for the a lattice-gas fluid governed by a nonideal equation of state. The model's complexity is not much beyond that of the FHP lattice-gas. It is suitable for massively parallel processing and may be used to study critical phenomena in large systems.",0
"The hypercomputers compute functions or numbers, or more generally solve problems or carry out tasks, that cannot be computed or solved by a Turing machine. Several numerical simulations of a possible hypercomputational algorithm based on quantum computations previously constructed by the authors are presented. The hypercomputability of our algorithm is based on the fact that this algorithm could solve a classically non-computable decision problem, Hilbert's tenth problem. The numerical simulations were realized for three types of Diophantine equations: with and without solutions in non-negative integers, and without solutions by way of various traditional mathematical packages.",0
"We have analyzed three XMM-Newton observations of the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 509, with the goal to detect small variations in the ionized outflow properties. Such measurements are limited by the quality of the cross-calibration between RGS, the best instrument to characterize the spectrum, and EPIC-pn, the best instrument to characterize the variability. For all three observations we are able to improve the relative calibration of RGS and pn consistently to 4 %. In all observations we detect three different outflow components and, thanks to our accurate cross-calibration we are able to detect small differences in the ionization parameter and column density in the highest ionized component of the outflow. This constrains the location of this component of the outflow to within 0.5 pc of the central source. Our method for modeling the relative effective area is not restricted to just this source and can in principle be extended to other types of sources as well.",0
"Assuming the standard framework of mirror symmetry, a conjecture is formulated describing how the diffeomorphism group of a Calabi-Yau manifold Y should act by families of Fourier-Mukai transforms over the complex moduli space of the mirror X. The conjecture generalizes a proposal of Kontsevich relating monodromy transformations and self-equivalences. Supporting evidence is given in the case of elliptic curves, lattice-polarized K3 surfaces and Calabi-Yau threefolds. A relation to the global Torelli problem is discussed.",0
"It is proved that if two quasitoric manifolds of dimension $\le 2p^2-4$ for a prime $p$ have isomorphic cohomology rings, then they have the same $p$-local stable homotopy type.",0
Our last experimental results on the realization of a measurement-conditional unitary operation at single photon level are presented. This gate operates by rotating by $90^o$ the polarization of a photon produced by means of Type-II Parametric Down Conversion conditional to a polarization measurement on the correlated photon. We then propose a new scheme for measuring the quantum efficiency of a single photon detection apparatus by using this set-up. We present experimental results obtained with this scheme compared with {\it traditional} biphoton calibration. Our results show the interesting potentiality of the suggested scheme.,0
"The softmax content-based attention mechanism has proven to be very beneficial in many applications of recurrent neural networks. Nevertheless it suffers from two major computational limitations. First, its computations for an attention lookup scale linearly in the size of the attended sequence. Second, it does not encode the sequence into a fixed-size representation but instead requires to memorize all the hidden states. These two limitations restrict the use of the softmax attention mechanism to relatively small-scale applications with short sequences and few lookups per sequence. In this work we introduce a family of linear attention mechanisms designed to overcome the two limitations listed above. We show that removing the softmax non-linearity from the traditional attention formulation yields constant-time attention lookups and fixed-size representations of the attended sequences. These properties make these linear attention mechanisms particularly suitable for large-scale applications with extreme query loads, real-time requirements and memory constraints. Early experiments on a question answering task show that these linear mechanisms yield significantly better accuracy results than no attention, but obviously worse than their softmax alternative.",0
"We introduce the notion of entanglement of subspaces as a measure that quantify the entanglement of bipartite states in a randomly selected subspace. We discuss its properties and in particular we show that for maximally entangled subspaces it is additive. Furthermore, we show that maximally entangled subspaces can play an important role in the study of quantum error correction codes. We discuss both degenerate and non-degenerate codes and show that the subspace spanned by the logical codewords of a non-degenerate code is a 2k-totally (maximally) entangled subspace. As for non-degenerate codes, we provide a mathematical definition in terms of subspaces and, as an example, we analyze Shor's nine qubits code in terms of 22 mutually orthogonal subspaces.",0
"Recent interferometric observations have called into question the traditional view of the Orion-KL region, which displays one of the most well-defined cases of chemical differentiation in a star-forming region. Previous, lower-resolution images of Orion-KL show emission signatures for oxygen-bearing organic molecules toward the Orion Compact Ridge, and emission for nitrogen-bearing organic molecules toward the Orion Hot Core. However, more recent observations at higher spatial resolution indicate that the bulk of the molecular emission is arising from many smaller, compact clumps that are spatially distinct from the traditional Hot Core and Compact Ridge sources. It is this type of observational information that is critical for guiding astrochemical models, as the spatial distribution of molecules and their relation to energetic sources will govern the chemical mechanisms at play in star-forming regions. We have conducted millimeter imaging studies of Orion-KL with various beam sizes using CARMA in order to investigate the continuum structure. These \lambda;=3mm observations have synthesized beam sizes of ~0.5""""-5.0"""". These observations reveal the complex continuum structure of this region, which stands in sharp contrast to the previous structural models assumed for Orion-KL based on lower spatial resolution images. The new results indicate that the spatial scaling previously used in determination of molecular abundances for this region are in need of complete revision. Here we present the results of the continuum observations, discuss the sizes and structures of the detected sources, and suggest an observational strategy for determining the proper spatial scaling to accurately determine molecular abundances in the Orion-KL region.",0
"We show how the linear """"low-density theorem"""" of Drukarev and Levin can be extended to arbitrary positive integer power of the baryon density $\rho$. The n^th coefficient in the McLaurin expansion of the fermion condensate's $\rho$ dependence is the connected n-nucleon sigma term matrix element. We calculate the $O(\rho^2)$ coefficient in lowest-order perturbative approximation to the linear sigma model and then show how this and other terms can be iterated to arbitrarily high order. Convergence radius of the result is discussed.",0
"We show that a complete Riemannian manifold has finite topological type (i.e., homeomorphic to the interior of a compact manifold with boundary), provided its Bakry-\'{E}mery Ricci tensor has a positive lower bound, and either of the following conditions: (i) the Ricci curvature is bounded from above; (ii) the Ricci curvature is bounded from below and injectivity radius is bounded away from zero. Moreover, a complete shrinking Ricci soliton has finite topological type if its scalar curvature is bounded.",0
A model-independent formulation of anyons as spinning particles is presented. The general properties of the classical theory of (2+1)-dimensional relativistic fractional spin particles and some properties of their quantum theory are investigated. The relationship between all the known approaches to anyons as spinning particles is established. Some widespread misleading notions on the general properties of (2+1)-dimensional anyons are removed.,0
"We consider two copies of the Standard Model, interchanged by an exact parity symmetry, P. The observed fermion mass hierarchy is described by suppression factors $\epsilon^{n_i}$ for charged fermion $i$, as can arise in Froggatt-Nielsen and extra-dimensional theories of flavor. The corresponding flavor factors in the mirror sector are $\epsilon'^{n_i}$, so that spontaneous breaking of the parity P arises from a single parameter $\epsilon'/\epsilon$, yielding a tightly constrained version of Minimal Mirror Twin Higgs, introduced in our previous paper. Models are studied for simple values of $n_i$, including in particular one with SU(5)-compatibility, that describe the observed fermion mass hierarchy. The entire mirror quark and charged lepton spectrum is broadly predicted in terms of $\epsilon'/\epsilon$, as are the mirror QCD scale and the decoupling temperature between the two sectors. Helium-, hydrogen- and neutron-like mirror dark matter candidates are constrained by self-scattering and relic ionization. In each case, the allowed parameter space can be fully probed by proposed direct detection experiments. Correlated predictions are made as well for the Higgs signal strength and the amount of dark radiation.",0
"The theory of degenerate parabolic equations of the forms \[ u_t=(\Phi(u_x))_{x} \quad {\rm and} \quad v_{t}=(\Phi(v))_{xx} \] is used to analyze the process of contour enhancement in image processing, based on the evolution model of Sethian and Malladi. The problem is studied in the framework of nonlinear diffusion equations. It turns out that the standard initial-value problem solved in this theory does not fit the present application since it it does not produce image concentration. Due to the degenerate character of the diffusivity at high gradient values, a new free boundary problem with singular boundary data can be introduced, and it can be solved by means of a non-trivial problem transformation. The asymptotic convergence to a sharp contour is established and rates calculated.",0
"It is well known that in de Sitter space the (free) minimally coupled massless scalar field theory does not admit any de Sitter-invariant Hadamard state. Related to this is the fact that the propagator for the massive scalar field corresponding to the de Sitter-invariant vacuum state diverges in the massless limit, with the infrared-divergent term being a constant. Since the Faddeev-Popov ghosts for the covariantly quantized Yang-Mills theory are minimally coupled massless scalar fields, it might appear that de Sitter symmetry would be broken in the ghost sector of Yang-Mills theory in de Sitter space. It is shown in this paper that the modes responsible for de Sitter symmetry breaking can be removed in a way consistent with BRST invariance and that a de Sitter-invariant theory can be constructed. More generally, it is shown that the spatially constant modes (the zero modes) of the Faddeev-Popov ghosts can be disposed of in a wide class of spacetimes with compact spatial sections. Then, the effective theory obtained by removing the zero modes, which contains a non-local interaction term, is shown to be equivalent to the theory corresponding to using a Faddeev-Popov-ghost propagator with the constant infrared-divergent term removed, provided that one can freely integrate by parts in the spacetime integral at the vertex for the ghost interaction term.",0
"Bimetallic catalysts can undergo segregation or redistribution of the metals driven by oxidizing and reducing environments. Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) was used to relate displacement fields to compositional distributions in crystalline Pt-Rh alloy nanoparticles. 3D images of internal composition showed that the radial distribution of compositions reverses partially between the surface shell and the core when gas flow changes between O2 and H2. Our observation suggests that the elemental segregation of nanoparticle catalysts should be highly active during heterogeneous catalysis and can be a controlling factor in synthesis of electrocatalysts. In addition, our study exemplifies applications of BCDI for in situ 3D imaging of internal equilibrium compositions in other bimetallic alloy nanoparticles.",0
"Current AI approaches have frequently been used to help personalize many aspects of medical experiences and tailor them to a specific individuals' needs. However, while such systems consider medically-relevant information, they ignore socially-relevant information about how this diagnosis should be communicated and discussed with the patient. The lack of this capability may lead to mis-communication, resulting in serious implications, such as patients opting out of the best treatment. Consider a case in which the same treatment is proposed to two different individuals. The manner in which this treatment is mediated to each should be different, depending on the individual patient's history, knowledge, and mental state. While it is clear that this communication should be conveyed via a human medical expert and not a software-based system, humans are not always capable of considering all of the relevant aspects and traversing all available information. We pose the challenge of creating Intelligent Agents (IAs) to assist medical service providers (MSPs) and consumers in establishing a more personalized human-to-human dialogue. Personalizing conversations will enable patients and MSPs to reach a solution that is best for their particular situation, such that a relation of trust can be built and commitment to the outcome of the interaction is assured. We propose a four-part conceptual framework for personalized social interactions, expand on which techniques are available within current AI research and discuss what has yet to be achieved.",0
"Two Hamiltonian formulations of General Relativity, due to Pirani, Schild and Skinner (Phys. Rev. 87, 452, 1952) and Dirac (Proc. Roy. Soc. A 246, 333, 1958), are considered. Both formulations, despite having different expressions for constraints, allow one to derive four-dimensional diffeomorphism invariance. The relation between these two formulations at all stages of the Dirac approach to the constrained Hamiltonian systems is analyzed. It is shown that the complete sets of their phase-space variables are related by a transformation which satisfies the ordinary condition of canonicity known for unconstrained Hamiltonians and, in addition, converts one total Hamiltonian into another, thus preserving form-invariance of generalized Hamiltonian equations for constrained systems.",0
"Using the pruned-enriched Rosenbluth Monte Carlo algorithm, the scattering functions of semiflexible macromolecules in dilute solution under good solvent conditions are estimated both in $d=2$ and $d=3$ dimensions, considering also the effect of stretching forces. Using self-avoiding walks of up to $N = 25600$ steps on the square and simple cubic lattices, variable chain stiffness is modeled by introducing an energy penalty $\epsilon_b$ for chain bending; varying $q_b=\exp (- \epsilon_b/k_BT)$ from $q_b=1$ (completely flexible chains) to $q_b = 0.005$, the persistence length can be varied over two orders of magnitude. For unstretched semiflexible chains we test the applicability of the Kratky-Porod worm-like chain model to describe the scattering function, and discuss methods for extracting persistence length estimates from scattering. While in $d=2$ the direct crossover from rod-like chains to self-avoiding walks invalidates the Kratky-Porod description, it holds in $d=3$ for stiff chains if the number of Kuhn segments $n_K$ does not exceed a limiting value $n^*_K$ (which depends on the persistence length). For stretched chains, the Pincus blob size enters as a further characteristic length scale. The anisotropy of the scattering is well described by the modified Debye function, if the actual observed chain extension $<X>$ (end-to-end distance in the direction of the force) as well as the corresponding longitudinal and transverse linear dimensions $<X^2> - <X>^2$, $<R_{g,\bot}^2>$ are used.",0
"A simple method combining photolithography and shadow (or angle) evaporation is developed to fabricate single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) devices with tube lengths L~10-50 nm between metal contacts. Large numbers of such short devices are obtained without the need of complex tools such as electron beam lithography. Metallic SWCNTs with lengths ~ 10 nm, near the mean free path (mfp) of lop~15 nm for optical phonon scattering, exhibit near-ballistic transport at high biases and can carry unprecedented 100 mA currents per tube. Semiconducting SWCNT field-effect transistors (FETs) with ~ 50 nm channel lengths are routinely produced to achieve quasi-ballistic operations for molecular transistors. The results demonstrate highly length-scaled and high-performance interconnects and transistors realized with SWCNTs.",0
This paper is devoted to the blow-up of analytic solutions with the emergence of irregular solutions.,0
"Suppose $S$ is a semispray on a manifold $M$. We know that the complete lift $S^c$ of $S$ is a semispray on $TM$ with the property that geodesics of $S^c$ correspond to Jacobi fields of $S$. In this note we generalize this result and show how geodesic variations of $k$-variables are related to geodesics of the $k$th iterated complete lift of $S$. Moreover, for sprays (that is, homogeneous semisprays) we show how geodesic variations of $(n-1)$-variables are related to a natural generalisation of Jacobi tensors.",0
"Following a similar recent analysis for CP violation in the electroweak sector of the standard model, we estimate the naturalness of a magnitude of CP violation (measured by the Jarlskog invariant J) close to the observed value in extensions of the standard model with left-right symmetry, such as the Pati-Salam model, where quark mass matrices are not Hermitian in general. We construct a simple and natural measure on the space of complex matrices which is both geometrically motivated and uses the observed quark mass hierarchy. We find that, unlike in the case of the standard model where the observed value for J seemed rather typical, one would now expect to observe |J|< 10^{-7}, clearly in conflict with the observed value J $\approx$ 3 x 10^{-5}. The crucial difference in the calculation lies in the non-Hermiticity of mass matrices that modifies the measure. We conclude that one would need additional assumptions modifying the measure to reproduce the observed value, and that in this sense the standard model is preferred to certain classes of left-right symmetric extensions: It does not need additional assumptions to explain the magnitude of CP violation.",0
"The volume of radio-astronomical data is a considerable burden in the processing and storing of radio observations with high time and frequency resolutions and large bandwidths. Lossy compression of interferometric radio-astronomical data is considered to reduce the volume of visibility data and to speed up processing. A new compression technique named """"Dysco"""" is introduced that consists of two steps: a normalization step, in which grouped visibilities are normalized to have a similar distribution; and a quantization and encoding step, which rounds values to a given quantization scheme using a dithering scheme. Several non-linear quantization schemes are tested and combined with different methods for normalizing the data. Four data sets with observations from the LOFAR and MWA telescopes are processed with different processing strategies and different combinations of normalization and quantization. The effects of compression are measured in image plane. The noise added by the lossy compression technique acts like normal system noise. The accuracy of Dysco is depending on the signal-to-noise ratio of the data: noisy data can be compressed with a smaller loss of image quality. Data with typical correlator time and frequency resolutions can be compressed by a factor of 6.4 for LOFAR and 5.3 for MWA observations with less than 1% added system noise. An implementation of the compression technique is released that provides a Casacore storage manager and allows transparent encoding and decoding. Encoding and decoding is faster than the read/write speed of typical disks. The technique can be used for LOFAR and MWA to reduce the archival space requirements for storing observed data. Data from SKA-low will likely be compressible by the same amount as LOFAR. The same technique can be used to compress data from other telescopes, but a different bit-rate might be required.",0
"Inter-personal touch is a powerful aspect of social interaction that we expect to be particularly important for emotional communication. We studied the capacity of closely acquainted humans to signal the meaning of several word cues (e.g. gratitude, sadness) using touch sensation alone. Participants communicated all cues with above chance performance. We show that emotionally close people can accurately signal the meaning of different words through touch, and that performance is affected by the amount of contextual information available. Even with minimal context and feedback, both attention-getting and love were communicated surprisingly well. Neither the type of close relationship, nor self-reported comfort with touch significantly affected performance.",0
"In the description of quantum key distribution systems, much attention is paid to the operation of quantum cryptography protocols. The main problem is the insufficient study of the synchronization process of quantum key distribution systems. This paper contains a general description of quantum cryptography principles. A two-line fiber-optic quantum key distribution system with phase coding of photon states in transceiver and coding station synchronization mode was examined. A quantum key distribution system was built on the basis of the scheme with automatic compensation of polarization mode distortions. Single-photon avalanche diodes were used as optical radiation detecting devices. It was estimated how the parameters used in quantum key distribution systems of optical detectors affect the detection of the time frame with attenuated optical pulse in synchronization mode with respect to its probabilistic and time-domain characteristics. A design method was given for the process that detects the time frame that includes an optical pulse during synchronization. This paper describes the main quantum communication channel attack methods by removing a portion of optical emission. This paper describes the developed synchronization algorithm that takes into account the time required to restore the photodetectors operation state after the photon has been registered during synchronization. The computer simulation results of the developed synchronization algorithm were analyzed...",0
"Let $\Omega$ be a bounded domain with $C^\infty$ boundary in an $n$-dimensional $C^\infty$ Riemannian manifold, and let $\varrho$ be a non-negative bounded function defined on $\partial \Omega$. It is well-known that for the biharmonic equation $\Delta^2 u=0$ in $\Omega$ with the 0-Dirichlet boundary condition, there exists an infinite set $\{u_k\}$ of biharmonic functions in $\Omega$ with positive eigenvalues $\{\lambda_k\}$ satisfying $\Delta u_k+ \lambda_k \varrho \frac{\partial u_k}{\partial \nu}=0$ on the boundary $\partial \Omega$. In this paper, we give the Weyl-type asymptotic formula with a sharp remainder estimate for the counting function of the biharmonic Steklov eigenvalues $\lambda_k$.",0
"As the third paper of our serial studies that are aim at examining the AGN-host coevolution by using partially obscured AGNs, we extend the broad-line composite galaxies (composite AGNs) into ROSAT-selected Seyfert 1.8/1.9 galaxies basing upon the RASS/SDSS-DR5 catalog given by Anderson et al.. The SDSS spectra of in total 92 objects are analyzed by the same method used in our previous studies, after requiring the signal-to-noise ratio in the SDSS r' band is larger than 20. Combing the ROSAT-selected Seyfert galaxies with the composite AGNs reinforces the tight correlation between the line ratio [OI]/H\alpha vs. D_n(4000), and establishes a new tight correlation between [SII]/H\alpha vs. D_n(4000). Both correlations suggest the two line ratios are plausible age indicators of the circumnuclear stellar population for typical type I AGNs in which the stellar populations are difficult to be derived from their optical spectra. The ROSAT-selected Seyfert galaxies show that the two correlations depend on the soft X-ray spectral slope \alpha_X that is roughly estimated from the hardness ratios by requiring the X-ray count rates within 0.1-2.4 keV are larger than 0.02 counts s^-1. However, we fail to establish a relationship between \alpha_X and D_n(4000), which is likely caused by the relatively large uncertainties of both parameters (especially for \alpha_X because of the AGN intrinsic obscuration). The previously established L/L_Edd-D_n(4000) evolutionary sequence is reinforced again by the extension to the ROSAT-selected Seyfert galaxies. These X-ray-selected Seyfert galaxies are, however, biased against the two ends of the sequence, which implies that the X-ray Seyfert galaxies present a population at middle evolutionary stage.",0

"We have combined neutron scattering and piezoresponse force microscopy to study the relation between the exchange bias observed in CoFeB/BiFeO3 heterostructures and the multiferroic domain structure of the BiFeO3 films. We show that the exchange field scales with the inverse of the ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic domain size, as expected from Malozemoff's model of exchange bias extended to multiferroics. Accordingly, polarized neutron reflectometry reveals the presence of uncompensated spins in the BiFeO3 film at the interface with the CoFeB. In view of these results we discuss possible strategies to switch the magnetization of a ferromagnet by an electric field using BiFeO3.",0
"The evolution of the largest component has been studied intensely in a variety of random graph processes, starting in 1960 with the Erd\""""os-R\'enyi process. It is well known that this process undergoes a phase transition at n/2 edges when, asymptotically almost surely, a linear-sized component appears. Moreover, this phase transition is continuous, i.e., in the limit the function f(c) denoting the fraction of vertices in the largest component in the process after cn edge insertions is continuous. A variation of the Erd\""""os-R\'enyi process are the so-called Achlioptas processes in which in every step a random pair of edges is drawn, and a fixed edge-selection rule selects one of them to be included in the graph while the other is put back. Recently, Achlioptas, D'Souza and Spencer (2009) gave strong numerical evidence that a variety of edge-selection rules exhibit a discontinuous phase transition. However, Riordan and Warnke (2011) very recently showed that all Achlioptas processes have a continuous phase transition. In this work we prove discontinuous phase transitions for a class of Erd\""""os-R\'enyi-like processes in which in every step we connect two vertices, one chosen randomly from all vertices, and one chosen randomly from a restricted set of vertices.",0
"We revise the long studied problem of fluctuation conductivity (FC) in disordered two-dimensional superconductors placed in a perpendicular magnetic field by finally deriving the complete solution in the temperature-magnetic field phase diagram. The obtained expressions allow both to perform straightforward (numerical) calculation of the FC surface $\delta\sigma_{xx}^{(\mathrm{tot})}(T,H)$ and to get asymptotic expressions in all its qualitatively different domains. This surface becomes in particular non-trivial at low temperatures, where it is trough-shaped with $% \delta\sigma_{xx}^{(\mathrm{tot})}(T,H)<0$. In this region, close to the quantum phase transition, $\delta\sigma_{xx}^{(\mathrm{tot})}(T,H=\mathrm{const})$ is non-monotonic, in agreement with experimental findings. We reanalyzed and present comparisons to several experimental measurements. Based on our results we derive a qualitative picture of superconducting fluctuations close to $H_{\mathrm{c2}}(0) $ and T=0 where fluctuation Cooper pairs rotate with cyclotron frequency $\omega_{c}\sim\Delta_{\mathrm{BCS}}^{-1}$ and Larmor radius $\sim \xi_{\mathrm{BCS}}$, forming some kind of quantum liquid with long coherence length $\xi_{\mathrm{QF}}\gg\xi_{\mathrm{BCS}}$ and slow relaxation ($\tau_{\mathrm{QF}}\gg\hbar\Delta_{\mathrm{BCS}}^{-1}$).",0
"We present a software package that guesses formulae for sequences of, for example, rational numbers or rational functions, given the first few terms. We implement an algorithm due to Bernhard Beckermann and George Labahn, together with some enhancements to render our package efficient.

"We study the buckling of elastic spherical shells under osmotic pressure with the osmolyte concentration of the exterior solution as control parameter. We compare our results for the bifurcation behavior with results for buckling under mechanical pressure control, that is, with an empty capsule interior. We find striking differences for the buckling states between osmotic and mechanical buckling. Mechanical pressure control always leads to fully collapsed states with opposite sides in contact, whereas uncollapsed states with a single finite dimple are generic for osmotic pressure control. For sufficiently large interior osmolyte concentrations, osmotic pressure control is qualititatively similar to buckling under volume control with the volume prescribed by the osmolyte concentrations inside and outside the shell. We present a quantitative theory which also captures the influence of shell elasticity on the relation between osmotic pressure and volume. These findings are relevant for the control of buckled shapes in applications. We show how the osmolyte concentration can be used to control the volume of buckled shells. An accurate analytic formula is derived for the relation between the osmotic pressure, the elastic moduli and the volume of buckled capsules. This also allows to use elastic capsules as osmotic pressure sensors or to deduce elastic properties and the internal osmolyte concentration from shape changes in response to osmotic pressure changes. We apply our findings to published experimental data on polyelectrolyte capsules.",0
"Orseau and Ring, as well as Dewey, have recently described problems, including self-delusion, with the behavior of agents using various definitions of utility functions. An agent's utility function is defined in terms of the agent's history of interactions with its environment. This paper argues, via two examples, that the behavior problems can be avoided by formulating the utility function in two steps: 1) inferring a model of the environment from interactions, and 2) computing utility as a function of the environment model. Basing a utility function on a model that the agent must learn implies that the utility function must initially be expressed in terms of specifications to be matched to structures in the learned model. These specifications constitute prior assumptions about the environment so this approach will not work with arbitrary environments. But the approach should work for agents designed by humans to act in the physical world. The paper also addresses the issue of self-modifying agents and shows that if provided with the possibility to modify their utility functions agents will not choose to do so, under some usual assumptions.",0
"An extensive non-LTE abundance analysis based on Na I 5890/5896 doublet lines was carried out for a large unbiased sample of ~120 A-type main-sequence stars (including 23 Hyades stars) covering a wide v_e sin i range of ~10--300 km/s, with an aim to examine whether the Na abundances in such A dwarfs can be reliably established from these strong Na I D lines. The resulting abundances ([Na/H]_{58}), which were obtained by applying the T_eff-dependent microturbulent velocities of \xi ~2--4 km/s with a peak at T_eff ~ 8000 K (typical for A stars), turned out generally negative with a large diversity (from ~-1 to ~0), while showing a sign of v_e sin i-dependence (decreasing toward higher rotation). However, the reality of this apparently subsolar trend is very questionable, since these [Na/H]_{58} are systematically lower by ~0.3--0.6 dex than more reliable [Na/H]_{61} (derived from weak Na I 6154/6161 lines for sharp-line stars). Considering the large \xi-sensitivity of the abundances derived from these saturated Na I D lines, we regard that [Na/H]_{58} must have been erroneously underestimated, suspecting that the conventional \xi values are improperly too large at least for such strong high-forming Na I 5890/5896 lines, presumably due to the depth-dependence of \xi decreasing with height. The nature of atmospheric turbulent velocity field in mid-to-late A stars would have to be more investigated before we can determine reliable sodium abundances from these strong resonance D lines.",0
"Dynamical processes on complex networks such as information propagation, innovation diffusion, cascading failures or epidemic spreading are highly affected by their underlying topologies as characterized by, for instance, degree-degree correlations. Here, we introduce the concept of copulas in order to artificially generate random networks with an arbitrary degree distribution and a rich a priori degree-degree correlation (or `association') structure. The accuracy of the proposed formalism and corresponding algorithm is numerically confirmed. The derived network ensembles can be systematically deployed as proper null models, in order to unfold the complex interplay between the topology of real networks and the dynamics on top of them.",0
"In this dissertation, I present a general method for studying quantum error correction codes (QECCs). This method not only provides us an intuitive way of understanding QECCs, but also leads to several extensions of standard QECCs, including the operator quantum error correction (OQECC), the entanglement-assisted quantum error correction (EAQECC). Furthermore, we can combine both OQECC and EAQECC into a unified formalism, the entanglement-assisted operator formalism. This provides great flexibility of designing QECCs for different applications. Finally, I show that the performance of quantum low-density parity-check codes will be largely improved using entanglement-assisted formalism.",0
"We consider a planar system of fermions, at finite temperature and density, under a static magnetic field parallel to the two-dimensional plane. This magnetic field generates a Zeeman effect and, then, a spin polarization of the system. The critical properties are studied from the Landau's free energy. The possible observable consequences of the magnetization of planar systems such as polymer films and graphene are discussed.",0
"We present a measurement of the time-dependent CP-violating asymmetries in neutral B decays to the $\pi^+\pi^-$ CP eigenstate, and an updated measurement of the charge asymmetry in $B^0\to K^+\pi^-$ decays. In a sample of 33 million $\Upsilon(4S)\to B\bar B$ decays collected with the BABAR detector at the SLAC PEP-II asymmetric $B$ Factory, we find $65^{+12}_{-11}$ $\pi^+\pi^-$ and $217\pm 18$ $K^+\pi^-$ candidates and measure the asymmetry parameters $S_{\pi\pi} = 0.03^{+0.53}_{-0.56}\pm 0.11$, $C_{\pi\pi} = -0.25^{+0.45}_{-0.47}\pm 0.14$, and ${\cal A}_{K\pi} = -0.07 \pm 0.08 \pm 0.02$, where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic.",0
"In crowd scenarios, reliable trajectory prediction of pedestrians requires insightful understanding of their social behaviors. These behaviors have been well investigated by plenty of studies, while it is hard to be fully expressed by hand-craft rules. Recent studies based on LSTM networks have shown great ability to learn social behaviors. However, many of these methods rely on previous neighboring hidden states but ignore the important current intention of the neighbors. In order to address this issue, we propose a data-driven state refinement module for LSTM network (SR-LSTM), which activates the utilization of the current intention of neighbors, and jointly and iteratively refines the current states of all participants in the crowd through a message passing mechanism. To effectively extract the social effect of neighbors, we further introduce a social-aware information selection mechanism consisting of an element-wise motion gate and a pedestrian-wise attention to select useful message from neighboring pedestrians. Experimental results on two public datasets, i.e. ETH and UCY, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed SR-LSTM and we achieves state-of-the-art results.",0
"We consider loop observables in gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten models, and study the action of renormalization group flows on them. In the WZW model based on a compact Lie group G, we analyze at the classical level how the space of renormalizable defects is reduced upon the imposition of global and affine symmetries. We identify families of loop observables which are invariant with respect to an affine symmetry corresponding to a subgroup H of G, and show that they descend to gauge-invariant defects in the gauged model based on G/H. We study the flows acting on these families perturbatively, and quantize the fixed points of the flows exactly. From their action on boundary states, we present a derivation of the """"generalized Affleck-Ludwig rule, which describes a large class of boundary renormalization group flows in rational conformal field theories.",0
"A new class of bivariate distributions is introduced that extends the Generalized Marshall-Olkin distributions of Li and Pellerey (2011). Their dependence structure is studied through the analysis of the copula functions that they induce. These copulas, that include as special cases the Generalized Marshall-Olkin copulas and the Scale Mixture of Marshall-Olkin copulas (see Li, 2009),are obtained through suitable distortions of bivariate Archimedean copulas: this induces asymmetry, and the corresponding Kendall's tau as well as the tail dependence parameters are studied.",0
"In this paper we study the ergodicity properties of some adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms (MCMC) that have been recently proposed in the literature. We prove that under a set of verifiable conditions, ergodic averages calculated from the output of a so-called adaptive MCMC sampler converge to the required value and can even, under more stringent assumptions, satisfy a central limit theorem. We prove that the conditions required are satisfied for the independent Metropolis--Hastings algorithm and the random walk Metropolis algorithm with symmetric increments. Finally, we propose an application of these results to the case where the proposal distribution of the Metropolis--Hastings update is a mixture of distributions from a curved exponential family.",0
"We start with a Riemann-Hilbert problem (RHP) related to a BD.I-type symmetric spaces $SO(2r+1)/S(O(2r-2s +1)\otimes O(2s))$, $s\geq 1$. We consider two Riemann-Hilbert problems: the first formulated on the real axis $\mathbb{R}$ in the complex $\lambda$-plane; the second one is formulated on $\mathbb{R} \oplus i\mathbb{R}$. The first RHP for $s=1$ allows one to solve the Kulish-Sklyanin (KS) model; the second RHP is relevant for a new type of KS model. An important example for nontrivial deep reductions of KS model is given. Its effect on the scattering matrix is formulated. In particular we obtain new 2-component NLS equations. Finally, using the Wronskian relations we demonstrate that the inverse scattering method for KS models may be understood as a generalized Fourier transforms. Thus we have a tool to derive all their fundamental properties, including the hierarchy of equations and the hierarchy of their Hamiltonian structures.",0
"We present a fully perturbative mechanism that naturally generates mass hierarchies for the Standard Model (SM) fermions in a flavor-blind sector. The dynamics generating the mass hierarchies can therefore be independent from the source of flavor violation, and hence this dynamics may operate at a much lower scale. This mechanism works by dynamically enforcing simultaneous diagonalization - alignment - among a set of flavor-breaking spurions, as well as generating highly singular spectra for them. It also has general applications in model building beyond the SM, wherever alignment between exotic and SM sources of flavor violation is desired.",0
"Strangelets (hypothetical stable lumps of strange quarkmatter) of astrophysical origin may be ultimately detected in specific cosmic ray experiments. The initial mass distribution resulting from the possible astrophysical production sites would be subject to reprocessing in the interstellar medium and in the earth's atmosphere. In order to get a better understanding of the claims for the detection of this still hypothetic state of hadronic matter, we present a study of strangelet-nucleus interactions including several physical processes of interest (abrasion, fusion, fission, excitation and de-excitation of the strangelets), to address the fate of the baryon number along the strangelet path. It is shown that, although fusion may be important for low-energy strangelets in the interstellar medium (thus increasing the initial baryon number A), in the earth's atmosphere the loss of the baryon number should be the dominant process. The consequences of these findings are briefly addressed.",0
"Motivated by research on contraction analysis and incremental stability/stabilizability the study of 'differential properties' has attracted increasing attention lately. Previously lifts of functions and vector fields to the tangent bundle of the state space manifold have been employed for a geometric approach to differential passivity and dissipativity. In the same vein, the present paper aims at a geometric underpinning and elucidation of recent work on 'control contraction metrics' and 'generalized differential Riccati equations'.",0
We consider the effects of electron scattering off a quantum magnetic impurity on the current-voltage characteristics of the helical edge of a two-dimensional topological insulator. We compute the backscattering contribution to the current along the edge for a general form of the exchange interaction matrix and arbitrary value of the magnetic impurity spin. We find that the differential conductance is a non-monotonous function of the voltage with several extrema.,0
"The WMAP satellite has completed one year of measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation using 20 differential high-electron-mobility-transistor (HEMT) based radiometers. All the radiometers are functioning nominally, and characterizations of the on-orbit radiometer performance are presented, with an emphasis on properties that are required for the production of sky maps from the time ordered data. A radiometer gain model, used to smooth and interpolate the CMB dipole gain measurements is also presented. No degradation in the sensitivity of any of the radiometers has been observed during the first year of observations.",0
"In this experimental study, a flowing dielectric barrier discharge operating at atmospheric pressure is used for the splitting of CO2 into O2 and CO. The influence of the applied frequency and plasma power on the microdischarge properties is investigated to understand their role on the CO2 conversion. Electrical measurements are carried out to explain the conversion trends and to characterize the microdischarges through their number, their lifetime, their intensity and the induced electrical charge. Their influence on the gas and electrode temperatures is also evidenced through optical emission spectroscopy and infrared imaging. It is shown that, in our configuration, the conversion depends mostly on the charge delivered in the plasma and not on the effective plasma voltage when the applied power is modified. Similarly, at constant total current, a better conversion is observed at low frequencies, where a less filamentary discharge regime with a higher effective plasma voltage than that at a higher frequency is obtained.",0
"This paper proposes a concept of generalized energy storage (GES) to facilitate the integration of large-scale heterogeneous flexible resources with electric/thermal energy storage capacity to participate in multiple markets. First, a generalized state variable referred to as degree of satisfaction (DoS) is defined, and dynamic models with a unified form are derived for different types of GESs. Second, a real-time market-based coordination framework is proposed to facilitate control, and ensure user privacy and device security. Demand curves of different GESs are then developed based on DoS to express their demand urgencies as well as flexibilities. Furthermore, a low-dimensional aggregate dynamic model of a GES cluster is derived thanks to the DoS-equality control feature provided by the design of demand curve. At last, an optimization model for a large-scale GESs to participate in both the energy market and regulation market is established based on the aggregate model. Simulations results demonstrate that the optimization algorithm could effectively reduce the total cost of an aggregator. Additionally, the proposed coordination method has high tracking accuracy and could well satisfy users' diversified power demand.",0
"We present the largest M31 near-infrared (F110W (close to J band), F160W (H band)) Cepheid sample so far. The sample consists of 371 Cepheids with photometry obtained from the HST PHAT program. The sample of 319 fundamental mode Cepheids, 16 first overtone Cepheids and 36 type II Cepheids, was identified using the median absolute deviation (MAD) outlier rejection method we develop here. This method does not rely on priors and allows us to obtain this clean Cepheid sample without rejecting a large fraction of Cepheids. The obtained Period-Luminosity relations (PLRs) have a very small dispersion, i.e. 0.155 mag in F160W, despite using random phased observations. This remarkably small dispersion allows us to determine that the PLRs are significantly better described by a broken slope at ten days than a linear slope. The use of our sample as an anchor to determine the Hubble constant gives a $3.2\%$ larger Hubble constant compared to the Riess et al. (2012) sample.",0
Asymptotic stability of small solitons in one dimension is proved in the framework of a discrete nonlinear Schrodinger equation with septic and higher power-law nonlinearities and an external potential supporting a simple isolated eigenvalue. The analysis relies on the dispersive decay estimates from Pelinovsky & Stefanov (2008) and the arguments of Mizumachi (2008) for a continuous nonlinear Schrodinger equation in one dimension. Numerical simulations suggest that the actual decay rate of perturbations near the asymptotically stable solitons is higher than the one used in the analysis.,0
"The Bloch-Horowitz (BH) equation has been successfully applied to calculating the binding energies of the deuteron and 3H/3He systems. For the three-body systems, BH was found to be perturbative for certain choices of the harmonic oscillator (HO) parameter b. We extend upon this work by applying this formalism to the alpha particle and certain five-, six-, and seven-body nuclei in the p-shell. Furthermore, we use only the leading order BH term and work in the smallest allowed included-spaces for each few-body system (0hw and 2hw). We show how to calculate A-body matrix elements within this formalism. Stationary solutions are found for all nuclei investigated within this work. The calculated binding energy of the alpha particle differs by ~1 MeV from Faddeev-Yakubovsky calculations. However, calculated energies of p-shell nuclei are underbound, leaving p-shell nuclei that are susceptible to cluster breakup. Furthermore, convergence is suspect when the size of the included-space is increased. We attribute this undesirable behavior to lack of a sufficiently binding mean-field.",0
"We present new results on the analytic eccentricity dependence of several sequences of gravitational wave flux terms at high post-Newtonian (PN) order for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals. These sequences are the leading logarithms, which appear at PN orders $x^{3k} \log^k(x)$ and $x^{3k+3/2} \log^k(x)$ for integers $k\ge 0$ ($x$ a PN compactness parameter), and the subleading logarithms, which appear at orders $x^{3k} \log^{k-1}(x)$ and $x^{3k+3/2} \log^{k-1}(x)$ ($k\ge 1$), in both the energy and angular momentum radiated to infinity. For the energy flux leading logarithms, we show that to arbitrarily high PN order their eccentricity dependence is determined by particular sums over the function $g(n,e_t)$, derived from the Newtonian mass quadrupole moment, that normally gives the spectral content of the Peters-Mathews flux as a function of radial harmonic $n$. An analogous power spectrum $\tilde{g}(n,e_t)$ determines the leading logarithms of the angular momentum flux. For subleading logs, the quadrupole power spectra are again shown to play a role, providing a distinguishable part of the eccentricity dependence of these flux terms to high PN order. With the quadrupole contribution understood, the remaining analytic eccentricity dependence of the subleading logs can in principle be determined more easily using black hole perturbation theory. We show this procedure in action, deriving the complete analytic structure of the $x^6 \log(x)$ subleading-log term and an analytic expansion of the $x^{9/2}$ subleading log to high order in a power series in eccentricity. We discuss how these methods might be extended to other sequences of terms in the PN expansion involving logarithms.",0
"The level density of 2+ states in 40Ca has been extracted in the energy region of the isoscalar giant quadrupole resonance (ISGQR) from a fluctuation analysis of high energy-resolution p,p') data taken at incident energies of 200 MeV at the K600 magnetic spectrometer of iThemba LABS, South Africa. Quasi-free scattering cross sections were calculated to estimate their role as a background contribution to the spectra and found to be small. The shape of the background was determined from the discrete wavelet transform of the spectra using a biorthogonal wavelet function normalized at the lowest particle separation threshold. The experimental results are compared to widely used phenomenological and microscopic models.",0
"Natural Killer (NK) cell activation is dynamically regulated by numerous activating and inhibitory surface receptors that accumulate at the immune synapse. Quantitative analysis of receptor dynamics has been limited by methodologies which rely on indirect measurements such as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Here, we report a novel approach to study how proteins traffic to and from the immune synapse using NK cell receptors tagged with the photoswitchable fluorescent protein tdEosFP, which can be irreversibly photoswitched from a green to red fluorescent state by ultraviolet light. Thus, following a localized switching event, the movement of the photoswitched molecules can be temporally and spatially resolved by monitoring fluorescence in two regions of interest. By comparing images with mathematical models, we evaluated the diffusion coefficient of the receptor KIR2DL1 (0.23 +- 0.06 micron^2/s) and assessed how synapse formation affects receptor dynamics. Our data conclude that the inhibitory NK cell receptor KIR2DL1 is continually trafficked into the synapse and remains surprisingly stable there. Unexpectedly however, in NK cells forming synapses with multiple target cells simultaneously, KIR2DL1 at one synapse can relocate to another synapse. Thus, our results reveal a previously undetected inter-synaptic exchange of protein.",0
"To study diffractive photon production at HERA, we compute the projection of the virtual photon-photon impact-factor on the BFKL leading-order eigenfunctions E(n,nu) for non-zero transfer. This calculation supplements former ones performed for n=0. We provide an expression for n=+/-2 and check that all the other components are zero.",0
"A new kind of quantum indeterminacy of transverse position is shown to arise from quantum degrees of freedom of spacetime, based on the assumption that classical trajectories can be defined no better than the diffraction limit of Planck scale waves. Indeterminacy of the angular orientation of particle trajectories due to wave/particle duality at the Planck scale leads to indeterminacy of a nearly-flat spacetime metric, described as a small nonvanishing quantum commutation relation between transverse position operators at different events along a null trajectory. An independent derivation of the same effect is presented based on the requirement of unitarity in black hole evaporation. The indeterminacy is interpreted as a universal holographic quantum spacetime noise, with a frequency-independent spectrum of metric perturbation amplitude, h_H^2^{1/2} \simeq \sqrt{l_P}=2.3 \times 10^{-22} /\sqrt{Hz}, where l_P denotes the Planck length. The effect is estimated to be directly measurable using current interferometer technology similar to LIGO and LISA.",0
"Graphs are used in almost every scientific discipline to express relations among a set of objects. Algorithms that compare graphs, and output a closeness score, or a correspondence among their nodes, are thus extremely important. Despite the large amount of work done, many of the scalable algorithms to compare graphs do not produce closeness scores that satisfy the intuitive properties of metrics. This is problematic since non-metrics are known to degrade the performance of algorithms such as distance-based clustering of graphs (Stratis et al. 2018). On the other hand, the use of metrics increases the performance of several machine learning tasks (Indyk et al. 1999, Clarkson et al. 1999, Angiulli et al. 2002 and Ackermann et al, 2010). In this paper, we introduce a new family of multi-distances (a distance between more than two elements) that satisfies a generalization of the properties of metrics to multiple elements. In the context of comparing graphs, we are the first to show the existence of multi-distances that simultaneously incorporate the useful property of alignment consistency (Nguyen et al. 2011), and a generalized metric property, and that can be computed via convex optimization.",0
"A positroid is the matroid of a matrix whose maximal minors are all nonnegative. Given a permutation $w$ in $S_n$, the matroid of a generic $n \times n$ matrix whose non-zero entries in row $i$ lie in columns $w(i)$ through $n+i$ is an example of a positroid. We enumerate the bases of such a positroid as a sum of certain products of Catalan numbers, each term indexed by the $123$-avoiding permutations above $w$ in Bruhat order. We also give a similar sum formula for their Tutte polynomials. These are both avatars of a structural result writing such a positroid as a disjoint union of matroids, each isomorphic to a direct sum of Catalan matroids and a matroid with one basis.",0
"Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT), is an advanced cancer therapy that destroys the cancer tumors using the well-known Li(p,n)Be . Because of the highly selectively reaction between a boron and a neutron, BNCT is effective for rapidly spreading cancer, invasive carcinoma, such as head and neck cancer, melanoma, malignant brain tumors and so on. The PKU RFQ group proposes an RFQ based neutron source for BNCT application. The 162.5 MHz four-vane RFQ will accelerate 20-mA H+ from 35.0 keV to 2.50 MeV in CW mode, and delivers a neutron yield of 1.73*10^13 n/sec/cm^2. The thermal management will become the most important issues. The detailed multiphysics analysis of the BNCT RFQ will be studied, and the RFQ frequency shift during nominal operating condition is also predicted. The multiphysics analysis is performed by using the CST Multiphysics Model and verified with ANSYS Multiphysics.",0
"Bell nonlocality and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering are every important quantum correlations of a composite quantum system. Bell nonlocality of a bipartite state is a quantum correlation demonstrated by some local quantum measurements, while EPR steering is another form of quantum correlations, observed firstly by Schrodinger in the context of famous EPR paradox. In this paper, we give some remarks on Bell nonlocality and EPR steering of bipartite states, including mathematical definitions and characterizations of these two quantum correlations, the convexity and closedness of the set of all Bell local states and the set of all EPR unsteerable states. We also derive a EPR-steering criteria, with which the EPR steerability of the maximally entangled states are checked.",0
"Mirroring their role in electrical and optical physics, two-dimensional crystals are emerging as novel platforms for fluid separations and water desalination, which are hydrodynamic processes that occur in nanoscale environments. For numerical simulation to play a predictive and descriptive role, one must have theoretically sound methods that span orders of magnitude in physical scales, from the atomistic motions of particles inside the channels to the large-scale hydrodynamic gradients that drive transport. Here, we use constraint dynamics to derive a nonequilibrium molecular dynamics method for simulating steady-state mass flow of a fluid moving through the nanoscopic spaces of a porous solid. After validating our method on a model system, we use it to study the hydrophobic effect of water moving through pores of electrically doped single-layer graphene. The trend in permeability that we calculate does not follow the hydrophobicity of the membrane, but is instead governed by a crossover between two competing molecular transport mechanisms.",0
"Unsupervised video summarization plays an important role on digesting, browsing, and searching the ever-growing videos every day, and the underlying fine-grained semantic and motion information (i.e., objects of interest and their key motions) in online videos has been barely touched. In this paper, we investigate a pioneer research direction towards the fine-grained unsupervised object-level video summarization. It can be distinguished from existing pipelines in two aspects: extracting key motions of participated objects, and learning to summarize in an unsupervised and online manner. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel online motion Auto-Encoder (online motion-AE) framework that functions on the super-segmented object motion clips. Comprehensive experiments on a newly-collected surveillance dataset and public datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method.",0
"The paper deals with the non-parametric estimation in the regression with the multiplicative noise. Using the local polynomial fitting and the bayesian approach, we construct the minimax on isotropic H\""""older class estimator. Next applying Lepski's method, we propose the estimator which is optimally adaptive over the collection of isotropic H\""""older classes. To prove the optimality of the proposed procedure we establish, in particular, the exponential inequality for the deviation of locally bayesian estimator from the parameter to be estimated. These theoretical results are illustrated by simulation study.",0
"We study the lambda-mu-calculus, extended with explicit substitution, and define a compositional output-based interpretation into a variant of the pi-calculus with pairing that preserves single-step explicit head reduction with respect to weak bisimilarity. We define four notions of weak equivalence for lambda-mu -- one based on weak reduction, two modelling weak head-reduction and weak explicit head reduction (all considering terms without weak head-normal form equivalent as well), and one based on weak approximation -- and show they all coincide. We will then show full abstraction results for our interpretation for the weak equivalences with respect to weak bisimilarity on processes.",0
"In this letter we show that superconducting Fe1.01Se undergoes a structural transition at 90 K from a tetragonal to an orthorhombic phase but that non-superconducting Fe1.03Se does not. Further, high resolution electron microscopy study at low temperatures reveals an unexpected additional modulation of the crystal structure of the superconducting phase involving displacements of the Fe atoms, and that the non-superconducting material shows a distinct, complex nanometer-scale structural modulation. Finally, we show that magnetism is not the driving force for the phase transition in the superconducting phase.",0
"We show a possible way to measure the column density of free electrons along the light path, the so-called Dispersion Measure (DM), from the early $[\sim 415 (\nu/1 {\rm GHz})^{-2} ({\rm DM}/10^{5} {\rm pc} {\rm cm}^{-3}) {\rm s}]$ radio afterglows of the gamma-ray bursts. We find that the proposed Square Kilometer Array can detect bright radio afterglows around the time $\sim 10^{3}(\nu/160 {\rm MHz})^{-2}$ s to measure the intergalactic DM ($\simg 6000$ pc cm$^{-3}$ at redshift $z>6$) up to $z\sim 30$, from which we can determine the reionization history of the universe and identify the missing warm-hot baryons. At low $z$, DM in the host galaxy may reach $\sim 10^{5}$ pc cm$^{-3}$ depending on the burst environment, which may be probed by the current detectors. Free-free absorption and diffractive scattering may also affect the radio emission in a high density.",0
"We review and extend the vertex algebra framework linking gauge theory constructions and a quantum deformation of the Geometric Langlands Program. The relevant vertex algebras are associated to junctions of two boundary conditions in a 4d gauge theory and can be constructed from the basic ones by following certain standard procedures. Conformal blocks of modules over these vertex algebras give rise to twisted D-modules on the moduli stacks of G-bundles on Riemann surfaces which have applications to the Langlands Program. In particular, we construct a series of vertex algebras for every simple Lie group G which we expect to yield D-module kernels of various quantum Geometric Langlands dualities. We pay particular attention to the full duality group of gauge theory, which enables us to extend the standard qGL duality to a larger duality groupoid. We also discuss various subtleties related to the spin and gerbe structures and present a detailed analysis for the U(1) and SU(2) gauge theories.",0
"Speckle photography can be used to monitor deformations of solid surfaces. The measuring characteristics, such as range or lateral resolution depend heavily on the optical recording and illumination set-up. This paper shows how, by the addition of two suitably perforated masks, the optical aperture of the system may vary from point to point, accordingly adapting the range and resolution to local requirements. Furthermore, by illuminating narrow areas, speckle size can be chosen independently from the optical aperture, thus lifting an important constraint on its choice. The new technique in described within the framework of digital defocused speckle photography under normal collimated illumination. Mutually limiting relations between range of measurement and spatial frequency resolution turn up both locally and when the whole surface under study is considered. They are deduced and discussed in detail.",0
"Many statistical mechanics problems can be framed in terms of random curves; we consider a class of three-dimensional loop models that are prototypes for such ensembles. The models show transitions between phases with infinite loops and short-loop phases. We map them to $CP^{n-1}$ sigma models, where $n$ is the loop fugacity. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we find continuous transitions for $n=1,2,3$, and first order transitions for $n\geq 5$. The results are relevant to line defects in random media, as well as to Anderson localization and $(2+1)$-dimensional quantum magnets.",0
"In the first part of this paper (mainly a review) we present general and formal (simple) introductions to the ordinary gaussian waves and to the Bessel waves, by explicitly separating the cases of the beams from the cases of the pulses; and, finally, an analogous introduction is presented for the Localized Waves (LW), pulses or beams. Always we stress the very different characteristics of the gaussian with respect to the Bessel waves and to the LWs, showing the numerous and important properties of the latter w.r.t. the former ones: Properties that may find application in all fields in which an essential role is played by a wave-equation (like electromagnetism, optics, acoustics, seismology, geophysics, gravitation, elementary particle physics, etc.). In the second part of this paper (namely, in its Appendix), we recall at first how, in the seventies and eighties, the geometrical methods of Special Relativity (SR) had predicted --in the sense below specified-- the existence of the most interesting LWs, i.e., of the X-shaped pulses. At last, in connection with the circumstance that the X-shaped waves are endowed with Superluminal group-velocities (as carefully discussed in the first part of this article), we briefly mention the various experimental sectors of physics in which Superluminal motions seem to appear: In particular, a bird's-eye view is presented of the experiments till now performed with evanescent waves (and/or tunneling photons), and with the """"localized Superluminal solutions"""" to the wave equations.",0
"Let H be a cocommutative faithfully flat Hopf quasigroup in a strict symmetric monoidal category with equalizers. In this paper we introduce the notion of (strong) Galois H-object and we prove that the set of isomorphism classes of (strong) Galois H-objects is a (group) monoid which coincides, in the Hopf algebra setting, with the Galois group of H-Galois objects introduced by Chase and Sweedler.",0
"When modeling game situations of incomplete information one usually considers the players' hierarchies of beliefs, a source of all sorts of complications. Hars\'anyi (1967-68)'s idea henceforth referred to as the """"Hars\'anyi program"""" is that hierarchies of beliefs can be replaced by """"types"""". The types constitute the """"type space"""". In the purely measurable framework Heifetz and Samet (1998) formalize the concept of type spaces and prove the existence and the uniqueness of a universal type space. Meier (2001) shows that the purely measurable universal type space is complete, i.e., it is a consistent object. With the aim of adding the finishing touch to these results, we will prove in this paper that in the purely measurable framework every hierarchy of beliefs can be represented by a unique element of the complete universal type space.",0
The long distance contribution to $K^+ \to \pi^+ \nu {\bar \nu} $ is calculated using chiral perturbation theory. The leading contribution comes from $O(p^4)$ tree terms. The branching ratio of the $O(p^4)$ long distance contribution is found to be of order $10_{-3}$ smaller than the short distance contributions.,0
"Certain linear objects, termed physical lines, are considered, and initial assumptions concerning their properties are introduced. A closed physical line in the form of a circle, termed J-string, is singled out for investigation. It is shown that this curve consists of indivisible line segments of length $\ell_\Delta$. It is assumed that a J-string has an angular momentum whose value is $\hbar$.It is then established that a J-string of radius $R$ possesses a mass $m_J$, equal to $h/2\pi c R$, a corresponding energy, as well as a charge $q_J$, where $q_J = (hc/2\pi)^{1/2}$. It is also established that $\ell_\Delta = 2\pi(hG/c^3)^{1/2}$, where $c$ is the speed of light and $G$ is the gravitational constant. % Based upon investigation of the properties and characteristics of J-strings, a method is developed for the computation of the Planck length and mass $(\ell^*_P, m^*_P)$. The values of $\ell^*_P$ and $m^*_P$ are computed according to the resulting formulae (and given in the paper); these values differ from the currently accepted ones.",0
"We find new static nonextremal black hole solutions that asymptote to AdS_4 in D=4 gauged N=2 supergravity. Solutions include electric and magnetic black holes with constant scalars that in the BPS limit reduce to naked singularities, but also magnetic black holes with running scalars that at extremality reduce to BPS black holes with finite horizon area. For all these solutions we compute area product formulae and show they are independent of the mass. Finally, we also find new examples of nonextremal magnetic black branes.",0
The present status of Connes' noncommutative view at the four forces is reviewed.,0
"We propose a new geometrical model of matter, in which neutral atoms are modelled by compact, complex algebraic surfaces. Proton and neutron numbers are determined by a surface's Chern numbers. Equivalently, they are determined by combinations of the Hodge numbers, or the Betti numbers. Geometrical constraints on algebraic surfaces allow just a finite range of neutron numbers for a given proton number. This range encompasses the known isotopes.",0
"We present theoretical prospects for creating p-wave paired BCS states of magnetic trapped fermionic atoms. Based on our earlier proposal of using dc electric fields to control both the strength and anisotropic characteristic of atom-atom interaction and our recently completed multi-channel atomic collision calculations we discover that p-wave pairing with $^{40}$K and $^{82,84,86}$Rb in the low field seeking maximum spin polarized state represent excellent choices for achieving superfluid BCS states; and may be realizable with current technology in laser cooling, magnetic trapping, and evaporative/sympathetic cooling, provided the required strong electric field can be applied. We also comment on the prospects of similar p-wave paired BCS states in $^{6}$Li, and more generally on creating other types exotic BCS states. Our study will open a new area in the vigorous pursuit to create a quantum degenerate fermionic atom vapor.",0
"Objective. Using raw, sub-second level, accelerometry data, we propose and validate a method for identifying and characterizing walking in the free-living environment. We focus on the sustained harmonic walking (SHW), which we define as walking for at least 10 seconds with low variability of step frequency. Approach. We utilize the harmonic nature of SHW and quantify local periodicity of the tri-axial raw accelerometry data. We also estimate fundamental frequency of observed signals and link it to the instantaneous walking (step-to-step) frequency (IWF). Next, we report total time spent in SHW, number and durations of SHW bouts, time of the day when SHW occurred and IWF for 49 healthy, elderly individuals. Main results. Sensitivity of the proposed classification method was found to be 97%, while specificity ranged between 87% and 97% and prediction accuracy between 94% and 97%. We report total time in SHW between 140 and 10 minutes-per-day distributed between 340 and 50 bouts. We estimate the average IWF to be 1.7 steps-per-second. Significance. We propose a simple approach for detection of SHW and estimation of IWF, based on Fourier decomposition. The resulting approach is fast and allows processing of a week-long raw accelerometry data (approx. 150 million measurements) in relatively short time (~half an hour) on a common laptop computer (2.8 GHz Intel Core i7, 16 GB DDR3 RAM).",0
"Thanks to Hrushovski-Loeser's work on motivic Milnor fibers, we give a model-theoretic proof for the motivic Thom-Sebastiani theorem in the case of regular functions. Moreover, slightly extending of Hrushovski-Loeser's construction adjusted to Sebag, Loeser and Nicaise's motivic integration for formal schemes and rigid varieties, we formulate and prove an analogous result for formal functions. The latter is meaningful as it has been a crucial element of constructing Kontsevich-Soibelman's theory of motivic Donaldson-Thomas invariants.",0
"Let $G$ be a unimodular Lie group, $X$ a compact manifold with boundary, and $M$ the total space of a principal bundle $G\to M\to X$ so that $M$ is also a strongly pseudoconvex complex manifold. In this work, we show that if $G$ acts by holomorphic transformations satisfying a local property, then the space of square-integrable holomorphic functions on $M$ is infinite $G$-dimensional.",0
"This is the second part to our companion paper [18]. Herein, we generalize to two space dimensions the C-method developed in [20,18] for adding localized, space-time smooth artificial viscosity to nonlinear systems of conservation laws that propagate shock waves, rarefaction waves, and contact discontinuities. For gas dynamics, the C-method couples the Euler equations to scalar reaction-diffusion equations, which we call C-equations, whose solutions serve as space-time smooth artificial viscosity indicators for shocks and contacts. We develop a high-order numerical algorithm for gas dynamics in 2-D which can accurately simulate the Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability with Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) roll-up of the contact discontinuity, as well as shock collision and bounce-back. We implement both directionally isotropic and anisotropic artificial viscosity schemes, the latter adding diffusion only in directions tangential to the evolving front. We additionally produce a novel shock collision indicator function, which naturally activates during shock collision, and then smoothly deactivates. Moreover, we implement a high-frequency 2-D wavelet-based noise detector together with an efficient and localized noise removal algorithm. We provide numerical results for some classical 2-D test problems, including the RT problem, the Noh problem, a circular explosion problem from the Liska and Wendroff [13] review paper, the Sedov blast wave problem, the double Mach 10 reflection test, and a shock-wall collision problem. In particular, we show that our artificial viscosity method can eliminate the wall-heating phenomenon for the Noh problem, and thereby produce an accurate, non-oscillatory solution, even though our simplified WENO-type scheme fails to run for this problem.",0
"Two-player zero-sum games are a well-established model for synthesising controllers that optimise some performance criterion. In such games one player represents the controller, while the other describes the (adversarial) environment, and controller synthesis corresponds to computing the optimal strategies of the controller for a given criterion. Asarin and Maler initiated the study of quantitative games on (non-probabilistic) timed automata by synthesising controllers which optimise the time to reach a final state. The correctness and termination of their approach was dependent on exploiting the properties of a special class of functions, called simple functions, that can be finitely represented. In this paper we consider quantitative games over probabilistic timed automata. Since the concept of simple functions is not sufficient to solve games in this setting, we generalise simple functions to so-called quasi-simple functions. Then, using this class of functions, we demonstrate that the problem of solving games with either expected reachability-time or expected discounted-time criteria on probabilistic timed automata are in NEXPTIME $\cap$ co-NEXPTIME.",0
"The RF part of the new high current injector-linac HSI consists of five cavities with the new operating frequency of 36 MHz instead of 27 MHz of the removed Wideroe type injector. The calculated power requirements of the cavities including beam load in three structures were between 110 kW for a rebuncher and 1.75 MW pulse-power for the two IH-cavities. The beam load is up to 150 kW for the RFQ and up to 750 kW for the two drift tube tanks. An additional 36 MHz debuncher in the transfer line to the Synchrotron (SIS) will need 120 kW pulse power. We decided to fulfil these demands with amplifiers of only two power classes, namely three amplifiers with 2 MW and six amplifiers with 200 kW pulse output power. The latter ones are also used as drivers for the 2 MW stages. The 200 kW amplifiers were specified in detail by GSI and ordered in the industry. The three 2 MW final amplifiers were designed, constructed and built by GSI. The paper gives an overview of the complete RF system and the operating performance of amplitude and phase control with beam load. It further describes some specialities of the new 2 MW amplifiers like the simplicity of the anode circuit, a very sophisticated socket for a cathode driven amplifier with cathode on dc ground, the parasitic mode-suppression, shielding and filtering of unallowable RF-radiation and operating experience since October 1999.",0
"Let E be an elementary abelian p-group of rank r and let k be a field of characteristic p. We introduce functors F_i from finitely generated kE-modules of constant Jordan type to vector bundles over projective space of dimension r-1. The fibers of these functors encode complete information about the Jordan type of the module. We prove that given any vector bundle of rank s on P^{r-1}, there is a kE-module M of stable constant Jordan type [1]^s such that the functor F_1 applied to M yields the original vector bundle for p=2 and the Frobenius twist of the original vector bundle for p>2. We also prove that the theorem cannot be improved if p is odd, because if M is any module of stable constant Jordan type [1]^s then the Chern numbers c_1, ... ,c_{p-2} of F_1(M) are divisible by p.",0
"In many practical tasks it is needed to estimate an effect of treatment on individual level. For example, in medicine it is essential to determine the patients that would benefit from a certain medicament. In marketing, knowing the persons that are likely to buy a new product would reduce the amount of spam. In this chapter, we review the methods to estimate an individual treatment effect from a randomized trial, i.e., an experiment when a part of individuals receives a new treatment, while the others do not. Finally, it is shown that new efficient methods are needed in this domain.",0
We propose a novel method for trapping Bose-condensed atoms using a white-light interference fringe. Confinement frequencies of tens of kHz can be achieved in conjunction with trap depths of only a few micro-K. We estimate that lifetimes on the order of 10 s can be achieved for small numbers of atoms. The tight confinement and shallow depth permit tunneling processes to be used for studying interaction effects and for applications in quantum information.,0
"Using Mach's principle, we will show that the observed diurnal and annual motion of the Earth can just as well be accounted as the diurnal rotation and annual revolution of the Universe around the fixed and centered Earth. This can be performed by postulating the existence of vector and scalar potentials caused by the simultaneous motion of the masses in the Universe, including the distant stars.",0
"Latency (i.e., time delay) in electronic markets affects the efficacy of liquidity taking strategies. During the time liquidity takers process information and send marketable limit orders (MLOs) to the exchange, the limit order book (LOB) might undergo updates, so there is no guarantee that MLOs are filled. We develop a latency-optimal trading strategy that improves the marksmanship of liquidity takers. The interaction between the LOB and MLOs is modelled as a marked point process. Each MLO specifies a price limit so the order can receive worse prices and quantities than those the liquidity taker targets if the updates in the LOB are against the interest of the trader. In our model, the liquidity taker balances the tradeoff between missing trades and the costs of walking the book. We employ techniques of variational analysis to obtain the optimal price limit of each MLO the agent sends. The price limit of a MLO is characterized as the solution to a new class of forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) driven by random measures. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the FBSDE and numerically solve it to illustrate the performance of the latency-optimal strategies.",0
"Many commercial products are sold with warranties and indirectly through dealers. The manufacturer-retailer distribution mechanism results in serious missing data problems in field return data, as the sales date for an unreturned unit is generally unknown to the manufacturer. This study considers a general setting for field failure data with unknown sales dates and a warranty limit. A stochastic expectation-maximization (SEM) algorithm is developed to estimate the distributions of the sales lag (time between shipment to a retailer and sale to a customer) and the lifetime of the product under study. Extensive simulations are used to evaluate the performance of the SEM algorithm and to compare with the imputation method proposed by Ghosh [Ann. Appl. Stat. 4 (2010) 1976-1999]. Three real examples illustrate the methodology proposed in this paper.",0
This paper shows how the enclosure method which was originally introduced for elliptic equations can be applied to inverse initial boundary value problems for parabolic equations. For the purpose a prototype of inverse initial boundary value problems whose governing equation is the heat equation is considered. An explicit method to extract an approximation of the value of the support function at a given direction of unknown discontinuity embedded in a heat conductive body from the temperature for a suitable heat flux on the lateral boundary for a fixed observation time is given.,0
"We present SemEval-2019 Task 8 on Fact Checking in Community Question Answering Forums, which features two subtasks. Subtask A is about deciding whether a question asks for factual information vs. an opinion/advice vs. just socializing. Subtask B asks to predict whether an answer to a factual question is true, false or not a proper answer. We received 17 official submissions for subtask A and 11 official submissions for Subtask B. For subtask A, all systems improved over the majority class baseline. For Subtask B, all systems were below a majority class baseline, but several systems were very close to it.

"Any stellar system with a star formation history (SFH) more extended than a massive star's lifetime will be composite in metallicity. Our method of chemically consistent evolutionary synthesis tries to account for the increasing initial metallicity of successive generations of stars. Using various sets of input physics for a range of metallicities $10^{-4} \leq Z \leq 0.05$ we keep track of the ISM enrichment and follow successive generations of stars using stellar evolutionary tracks, yields, model atmosphere spectra, index calibrations, etc., appropriate for their respective initial metallicities. Since the SFH determines the evolution not only of the metallicity, but, in particular, of abundance ratios of specific elements, stellar evolution and galaxy evolution become intimately coupled. I review the concept of chemically consistent evolution, present results for the photometric, spectral, and chemical evolution of galaxies of various types in the local Universe and at high redshift, and discuss its advantages as well as its current limitations.",0
"The connection method has earned good reputation in the area of automated theorem proving, due to its simplicity, efficiency and rational use of memory. This method has been applied recently in automatic provers that reason over ontologies written in the description logic ALC. However, proofs generated by connection calculi are difficult to understand. Proof readability is largely lost by the transformations to disjunctive normal form applied over the formulae to be proven. Such a proof model, albeit efficient, prevents inference systems based on it from effectively providing justifications and/or descriptions of the steps used in inferences. To address this problem, in this paper we propose a method for converting matricial proofs generated by the ALC connection method to ALC sequent proofs, which are much easier to understand, and whose translation to natural language is more straightforward. We also describe a calculus that accepts the input formula in a non-clausal ALC format, what simplifies the translation.",0
"We establish new relations which connect Euclidean sonar transforms (integrals taken over spheres with centers in a hyperplane) with classical Radon transforms. The relations, stated as operator identities, allow us to reduce the inversion of sonar transforms to classical Radon inversion.",0
"With the aim to corroborate the result of a search for chemically peculiar stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) we present measurements obtained from CCD-imaging of two fields, one containing a young open cluster (NGC 1711). While for the latter field, including its surrounding we obtain a contribution of three percent of chemically peculiar stars detectable by Delta a photometry (i.e. the magnetic objects of this group), the second field yields about half of this value in good accordance with the finding for NGC 1866 (Maitzen et al., 2001, A&A, 371, L5) the surrounding field of which has been found to exhibit a very low value of such stars - 0.3%. Thus we are faced with the fact, that our incipient impression about a substantially lower appearance of magnetic chemically peculiar stars in the LMC as compared to the Galaxy continues to be valid. Most of the photometrically identified peculiar stars (from their historical origin denominated Ap-stars) are located in the domain of the B-type stars. But this is a selection effect due to the limiting magnitude of our observing conditions impeding the observation of fainter main sequence stars. In addition to objects showing up as positive deviators in Delta a photometry we also discuss nine stars which appear opposite the main line of normal stars, hence are negative deviators. For most of them the interpretation as emission stars of B-type seems to be appropriate. The statistically relevant number of observations obtained so far in the LMC supports the view that the formation of magnetic peculiar stars has occurred there at a significantly lower rate.",0
"We report on observations of TeV-selected AGN made during the first 5.5 months of observations with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on-board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi). In total, 96 AGN were selected for study, each being either (i) a source detected at TeV energies (28 sources) or (ii) an object that has been studied with TeV instruments and for which an upper-limit has been reported (68 objects). The Fermi observations show clear detections of 38 of these TeV-selected objects, of which 21 are joint GeV-TeV sources and 29 were not in the third EGRET catalog. For each of the 38 Fermi-detected sources, spectra and light curves are presented. Most can be described with a power law of spectral index harder than 2.0, with a spectral break generally required to accommodate the TeV measurements. Based on an extrapolation of the Fermi spectrum, we identify sources, not previously detected at TeV energies, which are promising targets for TeV instruments. Evidence for systematic evolution of the $\gamma$-ray spectrum with redshift is presented and discussed in the context of interaction with the EBL.",0
"A brief review is first presented of attempts to predict stable multiquark states within current models of hadron spectroscopy. Then a model combining flip-flop and connected Steiner trees is introduced and shown to lead to stable multiquarks, in particular for some configurations involving several heavy quarks and bearing exotic quantum numbers.",0
"Within the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Model (CMSSM) it is possible to predict the low energy gauge couplings and masses of the 3 generation particles from a few supergravity inspired parameters at the GUT scale. Moreover, the CMSSM predicts electroweak symmetry breaking due to large radiative corrections from the Yukawa couplings, thus relating the $Z^0$ boson mass to the top quark mass via the renormalization group equations (RGE). In addition, the cosmological constraints on the lifetime of the universe are considered in the fits. The new precise measurements of the strong coupling constant and the top mass as well as higher order calculations of the $b \to s\gamma$ rate exclude perfect fits in the CMSSM, although the discrepancies from the best fit parameters are below the $2\sigma$ level.",0
"We present VLA \ion{H}{1} and optical spectra of the peculiar galaxy Arp~10. Originally believed to be an example of a classical colliding ring galaxy with multiple rings, the new observations show a large disturbed neutral hydrogen disk extending 2.7 times the radius of the bright optical ring. We also present evidence for optical shells or ripples in the outer isophotes of the galaxy reminiscent of the ripples seen in some early type systems. The small elliptical originally believed to be the companion is shown to be a background galaxy. The \ion{H}{1} disk consists of two main parts: a very irregular outer structure, and a more regular inner disk associated with the main bright optical ring. In both cases, the \ion{H}{1} structures do not exactly trace the optical morphology. In the outer parts, the \ion{H}{1} distribution does not correlate well with the optical ripples. Even the inner \ion{H}{1} disk does not correspond well morphologically nor kinematically to the optical rings. These peculiarities lead us to believe that the potential in which the \ion{H}{1} disk resides is significantly out of equilibrium --- a situation which would inherently produce rings of star formation. We suggest that Arp~10 is the result of the intermediate stage of a merger between a large \ion{H}{1} rich disk and a gas-poor disk system. As such, it may represent an example of a class of mergers which lies intermediate between the ``ripple and shell'' accretion systems and the head-on collisional ring galaxies.",0
"One of the most fundamental mathematical contributions of Garrett Birkhoff is the HSP theorem, which implies that a finite algebra B satisfies all equations that hold in a finite algebra A of the same signature if and only if B is a homomorphic image of a subalgebra of a finite power of A. On the other hand, if A is infinite, then in general one needs to take an infinite power in order to obtain a representation of B in terms of A, even if B is finite. We show that by considering the natural topology on the functions of A and B in addition to the equations that hold between them, one can do with finite powers even for many interesting infinite algebras A. More precisely, we prove that if A and B are at most countable algebras which are oligomorphic, then the mapping which sends each function from A to the corresponding function in B preserves equations and is continuous if and only if B is a homomorphic image of a subalgebra of a finite power of A. Our result has the following consequences in model theory and in theoretical computer science: two \omega-categorical structures are primitive positive bi-interpretable if and only if their topological polymorphism clones are isomorphic. In particular, the complexity of the constraint satisfaction problem of an \omega-categorical structure only depends on its topological polymorphism clone.",0
"We present two-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations of near-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf (WD) models for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) using the turbulent deflagration model with deflagration-detonation transition (DDT). We perform a parameter survey for 41 models to study the effects of the initial central density (i.e., WD mass), metallicity, flame shape, DDT criteria, and turbulent flame formula for a much wider parameter space than earlier studies. The final isotopic abundances of $^{11}$C to $^{91}$Tc in these simulations are obtained by post-process nucleosynthesis calculations. The survey includes SNe Ia models with the central density from $5 \times 10^8$ g cm$^{-3}$ to $5 \times 10^9$ g cm$^{-3}$ (WD masses of 1.30 - 1.38 $M_\odot$), metallicity from 0 to 5 $Z_{\odot}$, C/O mass ratio from 0.3 - 1.0 and ignition kernels including centered and off-centered ignition kernels. We present the yield tables of stable isotopes from $^{12}$C to $^{70}$Zn as well as the major radioactive isotopes for 33 models. Observational abundances of $^{55}$Mn, $^{56}$Fe, $^{57}$Fe and $^{58}$Ni obtained from the solar composition, well-observed SNe Ia and SN Ia remnants are used to constrain the explosion models and the supernova progenitor. The connection between the pure turbulent deflagration model and the subluminous SNe Iax is discussed. We find that dependencies of the nucleosynthesis yields on the metallicity and the central density (WD mass) are large. To fit these observational abundances and also for the application of galactic chemical evolution modeling, these dependencies on the metallicity and WD mass should be taken into account.",0
"We present a study of the local structure of high pressure hydrogen around the liquid-liquid transition line based on results from the Coupled Electron-Ion Monte Carlo method. We report results for the Equation of State, for the radial distribution function between protons g(r) and results from a cluster analysis to detect the possible formation of stable molecular ions beyond the transition line, as well as above the critical temperature. We discuss various estimates for the molecular fraction in both phases and show that, although the presence of $H_3^+$ ions is suggested by the form of the g(r) they are not stable against thermal fluctuations.",0
We provide the set of filters (saturated submonoids) in a commutative monoid with a topology (like the spectrum of a ring) and study the resulting spaces.,0
"Lane-Emden equation could be used to model stellar interiors, star clusters and many configurations in astrophysics. Unfortunately, there is an exact solution only for the polytropic index and . In the present paper, a series solution for the fractional Lane-Emden equation is presented. The solution is performed in the frame of modified Rienmann Liouville derivatives. The obtained results recover the well-known series solutions when . Fractional model of n=3 has been calculated and mass-radius relation, density ratio, pressure ratio and temperature ratio have been investigated. We found that the fractional star has a smaller volume and mass than that of the integer star.",0
"Solutions of the Schr\""""odinger equation are obtained for an electron in a two-dimensional circular semiconductor quantum ring in the presence of both external uniform constant magnetic field and the Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions of equal strengths. Confinement is simulated by a realistic potential well of a finite depth. The dependence of the energy levels on a magnetic field strength, strength of spin-orbit interaction and a relative ring width is presented.",0
"New computer-mediated channels of communication are action oriented and have the ability to deliver information and dialogue - moderated and unmoderated - which can facilitate the bringing together of a series of society's stakeholders, opinion leaders and change agents, who have the ability to influence social action. However, existing online studies have been limited in explaining Internet users' willingness to participate in social change agendas online. They have relied predominately on basic demographic descriptors such as age, education, income and access to technology and have ignored, social, psychological and attitudinal variables that may explain online participation and social change. The authors propose a Q methodology research approach better evaluate Internet users participation in online social change agendas.",0
"We show that the rapid and large decrease in the intensity of high-ionization emission lines from the Eta Carinae massive binary system can be explained by the accretion model. These emission lines are emitted by material in the nebula around the binary system that is being ionized by radiation from the hot secondary star. The emission lines suffer three months long deep fading every 5.54 year, assumed to be the orbital period of the binary system. In the accretion model, for ~70 day the less massive secondary star is accreting mass from the primary wind instead of blowing its fast wind. The accretion event has two effects that substantially reduce the high-energy ionizing radiation flux from the secondary star. (1) The accreted mass absorbs a larger fraction of the ionizing flux. (2) The accreted mass forms a temporarily blanked around the secondary star that increases its effective radius, hence lowering its effective temperature and the flux of high energy photons. This explanation is compatible with the fading of the emission lines at the same time the X-ray is declining to its minimum, and with the fading being less pronounced in the polar directions.",0
"A matrix polynomial is a polynomial in a complex variable $\lambda$ with coefficients in $n \times n$ complex matrices. The spectral curve of a matrix polynomial $P(\lambda)$ is the curve $\{ (\lambda, \mu) \in \mathbb{C}^2 \mid \mathrm{det}(P(\lambda) - \mu \cdot \mathrm{Id}) = 0\}$. The set of matrix polynomials with a given spectral curve $C$ is known to be closely related to the Jacobian of $C$, provided that $C$ is smooth. We extend this result to the case when $C$ is an arbitrary nodal, possibly reducible, curve. In the latter case the set of matrix polynomials with spectral curve $C$ turns out to be naturally stratified into smooth pieces, each one being an open subset in a certain generalized Jacobian. We give a description of this stratification in terms of purely combinatorial data and describe the adjacency of strata. We also make a conjecture on the relation between completely reducible matrix polynomials and the canonical compactified Jacobian defined by V.Alexeev.",0
"The recent promising achievements of deep learning rely on the large amount of labeled data. Considering the abundance of data on the web, most of them do not have labels at all. Therefore, it is important to improve generalization performance using unlabeled data on supervised tasks with few labeled instances. In this work, we revisit graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithms and propose an online graph construction technique which suits deep convolutional neural network better. We consider an EM-like algorithm for semi-supervised learning on deep neural networks: In forward pass, the graph is constructed based on the network output, and the graph is then used for loss calculation to help update the network by back propagation in the backward pass. We demonstrate the strength of our online approach compared to the conventional ones whose graph is constructed on static but not robust enough feature representations beforehand.",0
"We reformulate the projected imaginary-time evolution of Full Configuration Interaction Quantum Monte Carlo in terms of a Lagrangian minimization. This naturally leads to the admission of polynomial complex wavefunction parameterizations, circumventing the exponential scaling of the approach. While previously these functions have traditionally inhabited the domain of Variational Monte Carlo, we consider recently developments for the identification of deep-learning neural networks to optimize this Lagrangian, which can be written as a modification of the propagator for the wavefunction dynamics. We demonstrate this approach with a form of Tensor Network State, and use it to find solutions to the strongly-correlated Hubbard model, as well as its application to a fully periodic ab-initio Graphene sheet. The number of variables which can be simultaneously optimized greatly exceeds alternative formulations of Variational Monte Carlo, allowing for systematic improvability of the wavefunction flexibility towards exactness for a number of different forms, whilst blurring the line between traditional Variational and Projector quantum Monte Carlo approaches.",0
"The capacity of the AWGN broadcast channel is achieved by superposition coding, but superposition of individual coded modulations expands the modulation alphabet and distorts its configuration. Coded modulation over a broadcast channel subject to a specific channel-input modulation constraint remains an important open problem. Some progress has been made in the related area of unequal-error protection modulations which can be considered single-user broadcast transmission, but it does not approach all points on the boundary of the capacity region. This paper studies broadcast coded modulation using multilevel coding (MLC) subject to a specific channel input constellation. The conditions under which multilevel codes can achieve the constellation-constrained capacity of the AWGN broadcast channel are derived. For any given constellation, we propose a pragmatic multilevel design technique with near constellation-constrained-capacity performance where the coupling of the superposition inner and outer codes are localized to each bit-level. It is shown that this can be further relaxed to a code coupling on only one bit level, with little or no penalty under natural labeling. The rate allocation problem between the bit levels of the two users is studied and a pragmatic method is proposed, again with near-capacity performance. In further pursuit of lower complexity, a hybrid MLC-BICM is proposed, whose performance is shown to be very close to the boundary of the constellation-constrained capacity region. Simulation results show that good point-to-point LDPC codes produce excellent performance in the proposed coded modulation framework.",0
"Recently, a new approach for solving the three-body problem for (d,p) reactions in the Coulomb-distorted basis in momentum space was proposed. Important input quantities for such calculations are the scattering matrix elements for proton- and neutron-nucleus scattering. We present a generalization of the Ernst-Shakin-Thaler scheme in which a momentum space separable representation of proton-nucleus scattering matrix elements can be calculated in the Coulomb basis. The viability of this method is demonstrated by comparing S-matrix elements obtained for p$+^{48}$Ca and p$+^{208}$Pb for a phenomenological optical potential with corresponding coordinate space calculations.",0
"We review recent progress in modeling credit risk for correlated assets. We start from the Merton model which default events and losses are derived from the asset values at maturity. To estimate the time development of the asset values, the stock prices are used whose correlations have a strong impact on the loss distribution, particularly on its tails. These correlations are non-stationary which also influences the tails. We account for the asset fluctuations by averaging over an ensemble of random matrices that models the truly existing set of measured correlation matrices. As a most welcome side effect, this approach drastically reduces the parameter dependence of the loss distribution, allowing us to obtain very explicit results which show quantitatively that the heavy tails prevail over diversification benefits even for small correlations. We calibrate our random matrix model with market data and show how it is capable of grasping different market situations. Furthermore, we present numerical simulations for concurrent portfolio risks, i.e., for the joint probability densities of losses for two portfolios. For the convenience of the reader, we give an introduction to the Wishart random matrix model.",0
"The magnetic compound Ba_2CuGe_2O_7 has recently been shown to be an essentially two-dimensional spiral antiferromagnet that exhibits an incommensurate-to-commensurate phase transition when a magnetic field applied along the c-axis exceeds a certain critical value H_c. The T=0 dynamics is described here in terms of a continuum field theory in the form of a nonlinear sigma model. We are thus in a position to carry out a complete calculation of the low-energy magnon spectrum for any strength of the applied field throughout the phase transition. In particular, our spin-wave analysis reveals field-induced instabilities at two distinct critical fields H_1 and H_2 such that H_1 < H_c < H_2. Hence we predict the existence of an intermediate phase whose detailed nature is also studied to some extent in the present paper.",0
"In this paper we study an alternating sign matrix analogue of the Chan-Robbins-Yuen polytope, which we call the ASM-CRY polytope. We show that this polytope has Catalan many vertices and its volume is equal to the number of standard Young tableaux of staircase shape; we also determine its Ehrhart polynomial. We achieve the previous by proving that the members of a family of faces of the alternating sign matrix polytope which includes ASM-CRY are both order and flow polytopes. Inspired by the above results, we relate three established triangulations of order and flow polytopes, namely Stanley's triangulation of order polytopes, the Postnikov-Stanley triangulation of flow polytopes and the Danilov-Karzanov-Koshevoy triangulation of flow polytopes. We show that when a graph $G$ is a planar graph, in which case the flow polytope $F_G$ is also an order polytope, Stanley's triangulation of this order polytope is one of the Danilov-Karzanov-Koshevoy triangulations of $F_G$. Moreover, for a general graph $G$ we show that the set of Danilov-Karzanov-Koshevoy triangulations of $F_G$ is a subset of the set of Postnikov-Stanley triangulations of $F_G$. We also describe explicit bijections between the combinatorial objects labeling the simplices in the above triangulations.",0
"We prove the non existence of quantum caps of sizes 37 and 39. This completes the spectrum of quantum caps in PG(4, 4). This also implies the non existence of linear [[37,27,4]] and [[39,29,4]]-codes. The problem of the existence of non linear quantum codes with such parameters remains still open.",0
"We prove the following conjecture of Furstenberg (1969): if $A,B\subset [0,1]$ are closed and invariant under $\times p \mod 1$ and $\times q \mod 1$, respectively, and if $\log p/\log q\notin \mathbb{Q}$, then for all real numbers $u$ and $v$, $$\dim_{\rm H}(uA+v)\cap B\le \max\{0,\dim_{\rm H}A+\dim_{\rm H}B-1\}.$$ We obtain this result as a consequence of our study on the intersections of incommensurable self-similar sets on $\mathbb{R}$. Our methods also allow us to give upper bounds for dimensions of arbitrary slices of planar self-similar sets satisfying SSC and certain natural irreducible conditions.",0
"Xu introduced a system of partial differential equations to investigate singular vectors in the Verma modules of highest weight $\lambda$ over $\mathfrak{sl}(n,\mathbb{C})$. He proved that the solution space of this system in the space of truncated power series is spanned by $\{\sigma(1)\ |\ \sigma\in S_n\}$. We present an explicit formula of the solution $s_\alpha(1)$ for every positive root $\alpha$ and showed directly that $s_\alpha(1)$ is a polynomial if and only if $\langle\lambda+\rho,\alpha\rangle$ is a nonnegative integer. From this, we can recover a formula of singular vectors given by Malikov et al.",0
"The supersymmetric contributions to the Flavor Changing Neutral Current processes may be suppressed by decoupling the scalars of the first and second generations. It is known, however, that the heavy scalars drive the stop mass squareds negative through the two-loop Renormalization Group evolution. This tension is studied in detail. Two new items are included in this analysis: the effect of the top quark Yukawa coupling and the QCD corrections to the supersymmetric contributions to $\Delta m_K$. Even with Cabibbo-like degeneracy between the squarks of the first two generations, these squarks must be heavier than $\sim 40$ TeV to suppress $\Delta m_K$. This implies, in the case of a high scale of supersymmetry breaking, that the boundary value of the stop mass has to be greater than $\sim 7$ TeV to keep the stop mass squared positive at the weak scale. Low-energy supersymmetry breaking at a scale that is of the same order as the mass of the heavy scalars is also considered. In this case the finite parts of the two-loop diagrams are computed to estimate the contribution of the heavy scalar masses to the stop mass squared. It is found that for Cabibbo-like mixing between the squarks, the stop mass at the boundary needs to be larger than $\sim 2$ TeV. Thus, for both cases, the large boundary value of the stop masses leads to an unnatural amount of fine tuning to obtain the correct $Z$ mass.",0
"Hard scattering in a strongly absorptive regime requires a novel nonlinear k_t -- factorization. Here we discuss two recent developments: firstly the evaluation of radiative corrections to single particle spectra, and secondly an extension of the formalism to address topological cross sections and unitarity cutting rules.",0
"We give a more elementary proof of a result by Ambrosio, Fusco and Hutchinson to estimate the Hausdorff dimension of the singular set of minimizers of the Mumford-Shah energy (see [2, Theorem 5.6]). On the one hand, we follow the strategy of the above mentioned paper; but on the other hand our analysis greatly simplifies the argument since it relies on the compactness result proved by the first two Authors in [4, Theorem 13] for sequences of local minimizers with vanishing gradient energy, and the regularity theory of minimal Caccioppoli partitions, rather than on the corresponding results for Almgren's area minimizing sets.",0
"We study restricted computation models related to the Tree Evaluation Problem}. The TEP was introduced in earlier work as a simple candidate for the (*very*) long term goal of separating L and LogDCFL. The input to the problem is a rooted, balanced binary tree of height h, whose internal nodes are labeled with binary functions on [k] = {1,...,k} (each given simply as a list of k^2 elements of [k]), and whose leaves are labeled with elements of [k]. Each node obtains a value in [k] equal to its binary function applied to the values of its children, and the output is the value of the root. The first restricted computation model, called Fractional Pebbling, is a generalization of the black/white pebbling game on graphs, and arises in a natural way from the search for good upper bounds on the size of nondeterministic branching programs (BPs) solving the TEP - for any fixed h, if the binary tree of height h has fractional pebbling cost at most p, then there are nondeterministic BPs of size O(k^p) solving the height h TEP. We prove a lower bound on the fractional pebbling cost of d-ary trees that is tight to within an additive constant for each fixed d. The second restricted computation model we study is a semantic restriction on (non)deterministic BPs solving the TEP - Thrifty BPs. Deterministic (resp. nondeterministic) thrifty BPs suffice to implement the best known algorithms for the TEP, based on black (resp. fractional) pebbling. In earlier work, for each fixed h a lower bound on the size of deterministic thrifty BPs was proved that is tight for sufficiently large k. We give an alternative proof that achieves the same bound for all k. We show the same bound still holds in a less-restricted model, and also that gradually weaker lower bounds can be obtained for gradually weaker restrictions on the model.",0
"The intermetallic FeSi exhibits an unusual temperature dependence in its electronic and magnetic degrees of freedom, epitomized by the crossover from a low temperature non-magnetic semiconductor to a high temperature paramagnetic metal with a Curie-Weiss like susceptibility. Many proposals for this unconventional behavior have been advanced, yet a consensus remains elusive. Using realistic many-body calculations, we here reproduce the signatures of the metal-insulator crossover in various observables: the spectral function, the optical conductivity, the spin susceptibility, and the Seebeck coefficient. Validated by quantitative agreement with experiment, we then address the underlying microscopic picture. We propose a new scenario in which FeSi is a band-insulator at low temperatures and is metalized with increasing temperature through correlation induced incoherence. We explain that the emergent incoherence is linked to the unlocking of iron fluctuating moments which are almost temperature independent at short time scales. Finally, we make explicit suggestions for improving the thermoelectric performance of FeSi based systems.",0
It is shown that nonlinear elastic pre-stress of neo-Hookean hyperelastic materials can be used as a mechanism to generate finite cloaks and thus render objects near-invisible to incoming antiplane elastic waves. This approach appears to negate the requirement for special cloaking metamaterials with inhomogeneous and anisotropic material properties in this case. These properties are induced naturally by virtue of the pre-stress. This appears to provide a mechanism for broadband cloaking since dispersive effects due to metamaterial microstructure will not arise.,0
"We present a quantum Monte Carlo method capable of sampling the full density matrix of a many-particle system at finite temperature. This allows arbitrary reduced density matrix elements and expectation values of complicated non-local observables to be evaluated easily. The method resembles full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo but works in the space of many-particle operators instead of the space of many-particle wave functions. One simulation provides the density matrix at all temperatures simultaneously, from $T=\infty$ to $T=0$, allowing the temperature dependence of expectation values to be studied. The direct sampling of the density matrix also allows the calculation of some previously inaccessible entanglement measures. We explain the theory underlying the method, describe the algorithm, and introduce an importance-sampling procedure to improve the stochastic efficiency. To demonstrate the potential of our approach, the energy and staggered magnetization of the isotropic antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on small lattices, the concurrence of one-dimensional spin rings, and the Renyi $S_2$ entanglement entropy of various sublattices of the $6 \times 6$ Heisenberg model are calculated. The nature of the sign problem in the method is also investigated.",0
"The graph of overlapping permutations is a directed graph that is an analogue to the De Bruijn graph. It consists of vertices that are permutations of length $n$ and edges that are permutations of length $n+1$ in which an edge $a_1\cdots a_{n+1}$ would connect the standardization of $a_1\cdots a_n$ to the standardization of $a_2\cdots a_{n+1}$. We examine properties of this graph to determine where directed cycles can exist, to count the number of directed $2$-cycles within the graph, and to enumerate the vertices that are contained within closed walks and directed cycles of more general lengths.",0
"We present a robust method for quantum process tomography, which yields a set of Lindblad operators that optimally fit the measured density operators at a sequence of time points. The benefits of this method are illustrated using a set of liquid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) measurements on a molecule containing two coupled hydrogen nuclei, which are sufficient to fully determine its relaxation superoperator. It was found that the complete positivity constraint, which is necessary for the existence of the Lindblad operators, was also essential for obtaining a robust fit to the measurements. The general approach taken here promises to be broadly useful in studying dissipative quantum processes in many of the diverse experimental systems currently being developed for quantum information processing purposes.",0
"This paper describes the relationship between the first non-vanishing Milnor invariants of a classical link and the intersection invariant of a twisted Whitney tower. This is a certain 2-complex in the 4-ball, built from immersed disks bounded by the given link in the 3-sphere together with finitely many `layers' of Whitney disks. The intersection invariant is a higher-order generalization of the intersection number between two immersed disks in the 4-ball, well known to give the linking number of the link on the boundary, which measures intersections among the Whitney disks and the disks bounding the given link, together with information that measures the twists (framing obstructions) of the Whitney disks. This interpretation of Milnor invariants as higher-order intersection invariants plays a key role in the classifications of both the framed and twisted Whitney tower filtrations on link concordance (as sketched in this paper). Here we show how to realize the higher-order Arf invariants, which also play a role in the classifications, and derive new geometric characterizations of links with vanishing Milnor invariants of length less than or equal to 2k.",0
"Globular Clusters (GCs) are natural laboratories where stellar and chemical evolution can be studied in detail. In addition, their chemical patterns and kinematics can tell us wich Galactic structure (Disk, Bulge, Halo or extragalactic) the cluster belongs to. NGC 5927 is one of most metal-rich GCs in the Galaxy and its kinematics links it to the Thick Disk. We present abundance analysis based on high resolution spectra of 7 giant stars. The data were obtained using FLAMES/UVES spectrograph mounted on UT2 telescope of the European Southern Observatory. The principal motivation of this work is to perform a wide and detailed chemical abundance analysis of the cluster and look for possible Multiple Populations (MPs). We determined stellar parameters and measured 22 elements corresponding to light (Na, Al), alpha (O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti), iron-peak (Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) and heavy elements (Y, Zr, Ba, Ce, Nd, Eu). We found a mean iron content of [Fe/H]=-0.47 $\pm$0.02 (error on the mean). We confirm the existence of MPs in this GC with an O-Na anti-correlation, and moderate spread in Al abundances. We estimate a mean [$\alpha$/Fe]=0.25 $\pm$0.08. Iron-peak elements shows no significant spread. The [Ba/Eu] ratios indicate a predominant contribution from SNeII for the formation of the cluster.",0
"In this paper we study synchronized motions in complex networks in which there are distinct groups of nodes where the dynamical systems on each node within a group are the same but are different for nodes in different groups. Both continuous time and discrete time systems are considered. We initially focus on the case where two groups are present and the network has bipartite topology (i.e., links exist between nodes in different groups but not between nodes in the same group). We also show that group synchronous motions are compatible with more general network topologies, where there are also connections within the groups.",0
"The phase ordering dynamics of coupled chaotic bistable maps on lattices with defects is investigated. The statistical properties of the system are characterized by means of the average normalized size of spatial domains of equivalent spin variables that define the phases. It is found that spatial defects can induce the formation of domains in bistable spatiotemporal systems. The minimum distance between defects acts as parameter for a transition from a homogeneous state to a heterogeneous regime where two phases coexist The critical exponent of this transition also exhibits a transition when the coupling is increased, indicating the presence of a new class of domain where both phases coexist forming a chessboard pattern.",0
"Within the framework of semiclassical QCD approximations the short distance behavior of two static color charges in (2+1)-dimensional QCD is discussed. A classical linearization of the field equations is exhibited and leads to analytical results producing the static potential. Beyond the dominant classical part proportional to ln lambda R, QCD contributions of order R^1/2 and R are found.",0
This thesis contains some new results on the uniform rationality of Poincar\'e series of p-adic equivalence relations and Igusa's conjecture on exponential sums,0
We investigate the total spin in an individual single-wall carbon nanotube quantum dot with various numbers of electrons in a shell by using the ratio of the saturation currents of the first steps of Coulomb staircases for positive and negative biases. The current ratio reflects the total-spin transition that is increased or decreased when the dot is connected to strongly asymmetric tunnel barriers. Our results indicate that total spin states with and without magnetic fields can be traced by this method.,0
"In this article I discuss the outcome of an exploratory research project based on complexity science concepts and theories; this research is focused on the Great Power war dynamics in the time period 1495 - 1945. According to this research, the international system has self-organized critical (SOC) characteristics. A critical point is the attractor of the international system. The war dynamics of Great Powers can be illustrated by a power law. As a result of a driving force, the international system is constantly being pushed toward this critical point. The security dilemma is a booster of this driving force. Tension and frustration build up in the international system as a result of various system thresholds, and are periodically discharged through wars. The SOC characteristics of the international system result in a punctuated equilibrium dynamic. The punctuations produce new international systems, each with its specific characteristics. A quantifiable development of the international system toward a condition of increased stability and reduced resilience can be observed. In addition to SOC characteristics, the international system exhibits characteristics of a chaotic system. Chaos, order and development are closely linked. The SOC dynamics generate a process of social expansion. It is possible to explain the social integration of Europe from this perspective.",0
"We study odd viscosity in a holographic model of a Weyl semimetal. The model is characterised by a quantum phase transition from a topological semimetal to a trivial semimetal state. Since the model is axisymmetric in three spatial dimensions there are two independent odd viscosities. Both odd viscosity coefficients are non-vanishing in the quantum critical region and non-zero only due to the mixed axial gravitational anomaly. It is therefore a novel example in which the mixed axial gravitational anomaly gives rise to a transport coefficient at first order in derivatives at finite temperature. We also compute anisotropic shear viscosities and show that one of them violates the KSS bound. In the quantum critical region, the physics of viscosities as well as conductivities is governed by the quantum critical point.",0
"We examine aspects of primordial star formation in the presence of a molecular hydrogen-dissociating ultraviolet background. We compare a set of AMR hydrodynamic cosmological simulations using a single cosmological realization but with a range of ultraviolet background strengths in the Lyman-Werner band. This allows us to study the effects of Lyman-Werner radiation on suppressing H2 cooling at low densities as well as the high-density evolution of the collapsing core in a self-consistent cosmological framework. We find that the addition of a photodissociating background results in a delay of the collapse of high density gas at the center of the most massive halo in the simulation and, as a result, an increase in the virial mass of this halo at the onset of baryon collapse. We find that, contrary to previous results, Population III star formation is not suppressed for J$_{21} \geq 0.1$, but occurs even with backgrounds as high as J$_{21} = 1$. We find that H2 cooling leads to collapse despite the depressed core molecular hydrogen fractions due to the elevated H2 cooling rates at $T=2-5 \times 10^3$ K. We observe a relationship between the strength of the photodissociating background and the rate of accretion onto the evolving protostellar cloud core, with higher LW background fluxes resulting in higher accretion rates. Finally, we find that the collapsing halo cores in our simulations do not fragment at densities below $n \sim 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$ regardless of the strength of the LW background, suggesting that Population III stars forming in halos with T$_{vir} \sim 10^4$ K may still form in isolation.",0
"We consider the two-dimensional electron gas confined laterally to a narrow channel by a harmonic potential. As the Zeeman splitting matches the intersubband separation the nonlocal spin polarization develops a minimum as reported by Frolov et al. [Nature (London) 458, 868 (2009)]. This phenomenon termed Ballistic Spin Resonance is due to the degeneracy between the nearest oppositely polarized subbands that is lifted by spin-orbit coupling. We showed that the resonance survives the weak and short-range interaction. The latter detunes it and as a result shifts the Zeeman splitting at which the minimum in spin polarization occurs. Here this shift is attributed to the absence of Kohn theorem for the spin sloshing collective mode. We characterized the shift due to weak interaction qualitatively by analyzing the spin sloshing mode within the Fermi liquid phenomenology.",0
"We propose a pilot-data transmission overlay scheme for multipair massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relaying systems employing either half- or full-duplex (HD or FD) communications at the relay station (RS). In the proposed scheme, pilots are transmitted in partial overlap with data to decrease the channel estimation overhead. The RS can detect the source data with minimal destination pilot interference by exploiting the asymptotic orthogonality of massive MIMO channels. Then pilot-data interference can be effectively suppressed with assistance of the detected source data in the destination channel estimation. Due to the transmission overlay, the effective data period is extended, hence improving system throughput. Both theoretical and simulation results confirm that the proposed pilot-data overlay scheme outperforms the conventional separate pilot-data design in the limited coherence time interval scenario. Moreover, asymptotic analyses at high and low SNR regions demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme regardless of the coherence interval length. Because of simultaneous transmission, the proper allocation of source data transmission and relay data forwarding power can further improve the system performance. Hence a power allocation problem is formulated and a successive convex approximation approach is proposed to solve the non-convex optimization problem with the FD pilot-data transmission overlay.",0
"In this paper we derive a generic decomposition of the option pricing formula for models with finite activity jumps in the underlying asset price process (SVJ models). This is an extension of the well-known result by Alos (2012) for Heston (1993) SV model. Moreover, explicit approximation formulas for option prices are introduced for a popular class of SVJ models - models utilizing a variance process postulated by Heston (1993). In particular, we inspect in detail the approximation formula for the Bates (1996) model with log-normal jump sizes and we provide a numerical comparison with the industry standard - Fourier transform pricing methodology. For this model, we also reformulate the approximation formula in terms of implied volatilities. The main advantages of the introduced pricing approximations are twofold. Firstly, we are able to significantly improve computation efficiency (while preserving reasonable approximation errors) and secondly, the formula can provide an intuition on the volatility smile behaviour under a specific SVJ model.",0
In the first part of this paper we study minimal representations of simply connected simple split groups of type $D_k$ or $E_k$ over local non-archimedian fields. Our main result is an explicit formula for the spherical vectors in these representations. In the case of real and complex groups such a formula was obtained recently in hep-th/0107222. We also use our techniques to study the structure of the space of smooth vectors in the minimal representation recovering some results of Magaard and Savin. In the second part we consider groups as above defined over a global field. In this situation we describe the form of the automorphic functional on the minimal representation of the corresponding adelic group.,0
"We present a new optical imaging survey of supernova remnants in M83, using data obtained with the Magellan I 6.5m telescope and IMACS instrument under conditions of excellent seeing. Using the criterion of strong [S II] emission relative to Halpha, we confirm all but three of the 71 SNR candidates listed in our previous survey, and expand the SNR candidate list to 225 objects, more than tripling the earlier sample. Comparing the optical survey with a new deep X-ray survey of M83 with Chandra, we find 61 of these SNR candidates to have X-ray counterparts. We also identify an additional list of 46 [O III] -selected nebulae for follow-up as potential ejecta-dominated remnants, seven of which have associated X-ray emission that makes them strong candidates. Some of the other [O III]-bright objects could also be normal ISM-dominated supernova remnants with shocks fast enough to doubly ionize oxygen, but with Halpha and [S II] emission faint enough to have been missed. A few of these objects may also be H II regions with abnormally high [O III] emission compared with the majority of M83 H II regions, compact nebulae excited by young Wolf-Rayet stars, or even background AGN. The supernova remnant Halpha luminosity function in M83 is shifted a factor of ~ 4.5x higher than for M33 supernova remnants, indicative of a higher mean ISM density in M83. We describe the search technique used to identify the supernova remnant candidates and provide basic information and finder charts for the objects.",0
"In unification models based on SU(15) or SU(16), baryon number is part of the gauge symmetry, broken spontaneously. In such models, we discuss various scenarios of important baryon number violating processes like proton decay and neutron-antineutron oscillation. Our analysis depends on the effective operator method, and covers many variations of symmetry breaking, including different intermediate groups and different Higgs boson content. We discuss processes mediated by gauge bosons and Higgs bosons parallely. We show how accidental global or discrete symmetries present in the full gauge invariant Lagrangian restrict baryon number violating processes in these models. In all cases, we find that baryon number violating interactions are sufficiently suppressed to allow grand unification at energies much lower than the usual $10^{16}$ GeV.",0
"One of the bottlenecks that limit the transition of transformation-optics devices from concepts to practical use is the non-unit magnetic permeability generally required from a mathematical transformation. Simple renormalization of permeability, as used in many previous designs and experiments, introduces impedance mismatch and thus degrades the functional photonic performance. Here we propose an area-preserving affine coordinate transformation as a general method to solve this problem. Ideal transformation-optics functions can be preserved while nonmagnetism is achieved. As a specific example, we illustrate how to apply this affine method into the design of a two-dimensional electromagnetic beam bending adapter. Concerns related to fabrication, such as anisotropy degree and bending angles, are fully discussed. Our study is a significant step toward practical use of ideal transformation optics devices that can be implemented directly with existing dielectric materials.",0
"This is the first of a series of papers dedicated to the study of the partition function of three-dimensional quantum gravity on the twisted solid torus with the aim to deepen our understanding of holographic dualities from a non-perturbative quantum gravity perspective. Our aim is to compare the Ponzano-Regge model for non-perturbative three-dimensional quantum gravity with the previous perturbative calculations of this partition function. We begin by reviewing the results obtained in the past ten years via a wealth of different approaches, and then introduce the Ponzano--Regge model in a self-contained way. Thanks to the topological nature of three-dimensional quantum gravity we can solve exactly for the bulk degrees of freedom and identify dual boundary theories which depend on the choice of boundary states, that can also describe finite, non-asymptotic boundaries. This series of papers aims precisely at the investigation of the role played by the different quantum boundary conditions leading to different boundary theories. Here, we will describe the spin network boundary states for the Ponzano-Regge model on the twisted torus and derive the general expression for the corresponding partition functions. We identify a class of boundary states describing a tessellation with maximally fuzzy squares for which the partition function can be explicitly evaluated. In the limit case of a large, but finely discretized, boundary we find a dependence on the Dehn twist angle characteristic for the BMS3 character. We furthermore show how certain choices of boundary states lead to known statistical models as dual field theories-but with a twist.",0

Covariant form of equation of motion for arbitrarily shaped particle in the electromagnetic radiation field is presented. Equation of motion in the proper frame of the particle uses the radiation pressure cross section 3 $\times$ 3 matrix. The obtained equation of motion is compared with known result.,0
"A parallel current can destabilize a single flux line (FL), or an array of FLs. We consider the effects of pinning by point impurities on this instability. The presence of impurities destroys the long-range order of a flux lattice, leading to the so called Bragg glass (BrG) phase. We first show that the long-range topological order of the BrG is also destroyed by a parallel current. Nonetheless, some degree of short-range order should remain, whose destruction by thermal and impurity fluctuations, as well as the current, is studied here. To this end, we employ a cage model for a single FL in the presence of impurities and current, and study it analytically (by replica variational methods), and numerically (using a transfer matrix technique). The results are in good agreement, and in conjunction with a Lindemann criterion, provide the boundary in the magnetic field--temperature plane for destruction of short-range order. In all cases, we find that the addition of impurities or current (singly or in combination) leads to further increase in equilibrium FL fluctuations. Thus pinning to point impurities does not stabilize FLs in a parallel current $j_z$, although the onset of this instability is much delayed due to large potential barriers that diverge as $j_z^{-\mu}$.",0
"Data describing human interactions often suffer from incomplete sampling of the underlying population. As a consequence, the study of contagion processes using data-driven models can lead to a severe underestimation of the epidemic risk. Here we present a systematic method to alleviate this issue and obtain a better estimation of the risk in the context of epidemic models informed by high-resolution time-resolved contact data. We consider several such data sets collected in various contexts and perform controlled resampling experiments. We show how the statistical information contained in the resampled data can be used to build a series of surrogate versions of the unknown contacts. We simulate epidemic processes on the resulting reconstructed data sets and show that it is possible to obtain good estimates of the outcome of simulations performed using the complete data set. We discuss limitations and potential improvements of our method.",0
"Banks in the interbank network can not assess the true risks associated with lending to other banks in the network, unless they have full information on the riskiness of all the other banks. These risks can be estimated by using network metrics (for example DebtRank) of the interbank liability network which is available to Central Banks. With a simple agent based model we show that by increasing transparency by making the DebtRank of individual nodes (banks) visible to all nodes, and by imposing a simple incentive scheme, that reduces interbank borrowing from systemically risky nodes, the systemic risk in the financial network can be drastically reduced. This incentive scheme is an effective regulation mechanism, that does not reduce the efficiency of the financial network, but fosters a more homogeneous distribution of risk within the system in a self-organized critical way. We show that the reduction of systemic risk is to a large extent due to the massive reduction of cascading failures in the transparent system. An implementation of this minimal regulation scheme in real financial networks should be feasible from a technical point of view.",0
"A simplicial complex K is called d-representable if it is the nerve of a collection of convex sets in R^d; K is d-collapsible if it can be reduced to an empty complex by repeatedly removing a face of dimension at most d-1 that is contained in a unique maximal face; and K is d-Leray if every induced subcomplex of K has vanishing homology of dimension d and larger. It is known that d-representable implies d-collapsible implies d-Leray, and no two of these notions coincide for d greater or equal to 2. The famous Helly theorem and other important results in discrete geometry can be regarded as results about d-representable complexes, and in many of these results """"d-representable"""" in the assumption can be replaced by """"d-collapsible"""" or even """"d-Leray"""". We investigate """"dimension gaps"""" among these notions, and we construct, for all positive integers d, a 2d-Leray complex that is not (3d-1)-collapsible and a d-collapsible complex that is not (2d-2)-representable. In the proofs we obtain two results of independent interest: (i) The nerve of every finite family of sets, each of size at most d, is d-collapsible. (ii) If the nerve of a simplicial complex K is d-representable, then K embeds in R^d.",0
"The Bethe-Salpeter equation provides the most widely used technique to extract bound states and resonances in a relativistic Quantum Field Theory. Nevertheless a thorough discussion how to identify its solutions with physical states is still missing. The occurrence of complex eigenvalues of the homogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equation complicates this issue further. Using a perturbative expansion in the mass difference of the constituents we demonstrate for scalar fields bound by a scalar exchange that the underlying mechanism which results in complex eigenvalues is the crossing of a normal (or abnormal) with an abnormal state. Based on an investigation of the renormalization of one-particle properties we argue that these crossings happen beyond the applicability region of the ladder Bethe-Salpeter equation. The implications for a fermion-antifermion bound state in QED are discussed, and a consistent interpretation of the bound state spectrum of QED is proposed.",0

"The space of H1 martingales is interesting because of its duality with the space of BMO martingales. It is straightforward to show that every H1 martingale is a uniformly integrable martingale. However, the converse is not true. That is to say, some uniformly integrable martingales are not H1 martingales. This brief note provides a template for systematically constructing such processes.",0
"Lepton flavour asymmetries generated at the onset of the oscillations of sterile neutrinos with masses above the electroweak scale can be large enough to partly survive washout and to explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. This opens up new regions of parameter space, where Leptogenesis is viable within the type-I seesaw framework. In particular, we find it possible that the sterile neutrinos masses are substantially below 10^9 GeV, while not being degenerate. However, the required reheat temperature that is determined by the begin of the oscillations lies some orders of magnitude above the sterile neutrino mass-scale.",0
"In this paper we provide an axiomatic characterization of the idempotent discrete uninorms by means of three conditions only: conservativeness, symmetry, and nondecreasing monotonicity. We also provide an alternative characterization involving the bisymmetry property. Finally, we provide a graphical characterization of these operations in terms of their contour plots, and we mention a few open questions for further research.",0
"The strict connection between Lie point-symmetries of a dynamical system and its constants of motion is discussed and emphasized, through old and new results. It is shown in particular how the knowledge of a symmetry of a dynamical system can allow to obtain conserved quantities which are invariant under the symmetry. In the case of Hamiltonian dynamical systems it is shown that, if the system admits a symmetry of """"weaker"""" type (specifically, a \lambda\ or a \Lambda-symmetry), then the generating function of the symmetry is not a conserved quantity, but the deviation from the exact conservation is """"controlled"""" in a well defined way. Several examples illustrate the various aspects.",0
"Since the early 1990s with the arrival of a variety of new technologies, the capacity for authentic astronomical research at the high school level has skyrocketed. This potential, however, has not realized the bright-eyed hopes and dreams of the early pioneers who expected to revolutionise science education through the use of telescopes and other astronomical instrumentation in the classroom. In this paper, a general history and analysis of these attempts is presented. We define what we classify as an Astronomy Research in the Classroom (ARiC) project and note the major dimensions on which these projects differ before describing the 22 major student research projects active since the early 1990s. This is followed by a discussion of the major issues identified that affected the success of these projects and provide suggestions for similar attempts in the future.",0
"Tensor models are measures for random tensors. They generalise matrix models and were developed to study random geometry in arbitrary dimension. Moreover, they are strongly connected to quantum gravity theories as additionally to the standard bare-bones models, they encompass the field theoretical approach to loop quantum gravity known as group field theory. In the present thesis, we focus on the restricted case of quartic tensor models, for which a far greater number of rigorous mathematical results have been proven. Quartic models can be re-written as multi-matrix models using the intermediate field representation, and their perturbative expansions can be written as series expansions over combinatorial maps. Using a variety of map expansions, we prove analyticity results and useful bounds for the cumulants of various tensor models : the most general standard quartic model at any rank and the simplest renormalisable tensor field theory at rank 3. Then, we introduce a new class of models, the enhanced models, which perturbative expansions display new behaviour, different to the so called melonic behaviour that characterise most known tensor models so far.",0
"Dynamical spin structure factors of quantum spin nematic states are calculated in a spin-1/2 square-lattice J1-J2 model with ferromagnetic J1 and competing antiferromagnetic J2 interactions. To this end, we use a fermion representation, generalizing it to N flavors. We begin with a spin-triplet pairing state of fermion fields, called Z2 planar state, which is a stable saddle-point solution in the large-N limit in a finite parameter range where the couplings J1 and J2 compete strongly [R. Shindou and T. Momoi, Phys. Rev. B 80, 064410 (2009)]. Using a large-N expansion, we take into account fluctuations around this saddle point up to corrections of order 1/N. The dynamical spin structure factors thus obtained signify the existence of gapless q-linear director-wave (spin-wave) modes at q=(0,0) and gapped `gauge-field' like collective modes at q=(pi,pi), whose spectral weight vanishes as a linear and quadratic function of the momentum respectively. The low-energy collective modes contain fluctuations of nematic-director, spin, and gauge degrees of freedom. Associated with the gapless q-linear modes, we evaluate the temperature dependence of the nuclear spin relaxation rate 1/T1 in the low-temperature regime as 1/T1 \propto T^{2d-1}, where d is the effective spatial dimension.",0
"We present theoretical evidence that a magnetic monopole emerges in dynamic magnetic systems in the presence of the spin-orbit interaction. The monopole field is expressed in terms of spin damping associated with magnetization dynamics. We demonstrate that the observation of this spin damping monopole is accomplished electrically using Ampere's law for monopole current. Our discovery suggests the integration of monopoles into electronics, namely, monopolotronics.",0
"The etiologic basis for the vast majority of cases of congenital heart disease remains largely undefined. Viruses have been considered to be likely candidates since the recognition of the association between intrauterine rubella and congenital heart disease. Although the pathogenesis of cardiovascular defects is poorly understood, information gained from the study of congenital rubella syndrome suggests that mechanisms such as focal endothelial cell damage, resulting in obliteration of vascular supply, decreased growth rate, and shortened survival time of certain cells, and disturbed DNA replication in cells whose chromosomes were damaged secondary to the effects of virus replication may be operative in the production of defects in the developing fetus. In addition to rubella there is suggestive, but not conclusive, evidence that Coxsackie B3 and B4 virus infections during pregnancy can result in the birth of infants with a variety of types of congenital heart lesions and that intrauterine mumps virus infection may be etiologically related to the postnatal development of endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE). Although there are a number of other viruses that are potential etiologic agents of congenital heart disease, the current status of information is inadequate to allow even suggestive associations to be made. The most profitable areas for future investigation appear to be: (1) the epidemiology of congenital heart disease, (2) prospective studies of the association of maternal viral infection with abnormal offspring, (3) the in-depth virologic investigation of the infant with a cardiac defect, and (4) the development of experimental animal models of congenital heart disease. Successful control of virus-induced congenital heart disease will depend on the results of these investigations and the development of vaccines against the identified causative viruses and/or safe and effective antiviral chemotherapy for the woman in early gestation who is infected with a known teratogenic agent.",1
"Middle-aged female identical twins, one of whom had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), were evaluated for immunologic reactivity to previous antigenic challenges, including primary immunization with a foreign antigen, keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). These two women had lived together for all of their 58 years and neither was receiving anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive drugs at the time of these studies. Both twins demonstrated comparable 7S and 198 humoral antibody response to KLH, as well as similar viral antibody titers. However, the twin with SLE was anergic to common antigens, streptokinase-streptodornase, Trichophyton and Candida; furthermore delayed hypersensitivity to KLH did not develop after immunization. This observed discrepancy between humoral and cellular immunity in genetically similar subjects may be significant in the pathogenesis of SLE.",1
"Upper respiratory tract infections are the most common types of infectious diseases among adults. It is estimated that each adult in the United States experiences two to four respiratory infections annually. The morbidity of these infections is measured by an estimated 75 million physician visits per year, almost 150 million days lost from work, and more than $10 billion In costs for medical care. Serotypes of the rhinoviruses account for 20 to 30 percent of episodes of the common cold. However, the specific causes of most upper respiratory infections are undefined. Pneumonia remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality for nonhospitalized adults despite the widespread use of effective antimicrobial agents. There are no accurate figures on the number of episodes of pneumonia that occur each year in ambulatory patients. In younger adults, the atypical pneumonia syndrome Is the most common clinical presentation; Mycoplasma pneumoniae is the most frequently Identified causative agent. Other less common agents include Legionelia pneumophila, influenza viruses, adenoviruses, and Chiamydia. More than half a million adults are hospitalized each year with pneumonia. Persons older than 65 years of age have the highest rate of pneumonia admissions, 11.5 per 1,000 population. Pneumonia ranks as the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. The pathogens responsible for community-acquired pneumonlas are changing. Forty years ago, Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for the majority of infections. Today, a broad array of community-acquired pathogens have been implicated as etiologic agents Including Leglonella species, gram-negative bacilli, Hemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and nonbacterial pathogens. Given the diversity of pathogenic agents, it has become imperative for clinicians to establish a specific etiologic diagnosis before initiating therapy or to consider the diagnostic possibilities and treat with antimicrobial agents that are effective against the most likely pathogens.",1
"Our understanding of the pathogenesis of infectious, especially bacterial, diarrhea has increased dramatically. New etiologic agents, mechanisms, and diseases have become known. For example, Escherichia coli serogroup 0157 is now known to cause acute hemorrhagic colitis. Also, E. coli serogroups that produce Shiga toxin are recognized as etiologic agents in the hemolytic-uremic syndrome. The production of bacterial diarrhea has two major facets, bacterial-mucosal interaction and the induction of intestinal fluid loss by enterotoxins. Bacterial-mucosal interaction can be described in stages: (1) adherence to epithelial cell microvilli, which is often promoted by or associated with pill; (2) close adherence (enteroadherence), usually by classic enteropathogenic E. coli, to mucosal epithelial cells lacking microvilli; and (3) mucosal invasion, as with Shigella and Salmonella infections. Further large strides in understanding infectious diarrhea are likely with the cloning of virulence genes if additional host-specific animal pathogens become available for study.",1
"In the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, locally produced antibodies complex with an inciting antigen, yet to be identified, within the joint and activate the complement system, resulting in articular inflammation mediated primarily by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and their products. Chronic inflammatory cells then produce soluble factors that induce both tissue destruction and inflammation. A major issue is how and why apparently normal immune responses in the acute stage progress to chronic inflammation in subsequent months to years. Although it is often assumed that the initial etiologic agent, persisting in the joint or at an extra-articular site, is responsible for continued synovitis, this need not be the case. It is possible that once the inciting agent is cleared from the joint through a normal immune response, the presence of activated cells rich in surface class II histocompatibility (Ia) antigens could, under the influence of multiple genetic or environmental factors, become the target of autoimmune attack. Alternatively, the process might result from the interactions of synovial lining cells and their products with T cells assuming a secondary role. Further research into the relative contributions of soluble products, T helper and suppressor subsets, synoviocytes, and antigen determine which model is correct.",1
"Pharyngitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia represent the most common respiratory tract infections. With a view to establishing effective management strategies, the origins of these illnesses and the diagnostic techniques that have been developed to discover them are reviewed. Therapeutic regimens with documented efficacy are outlined with emphasis on specific rather than empiric treatment. Although many respiratory tract pathogens remain exquisitely sensitive to penicillin, the emergence of resistant strains underscores the need for safe and effective alternative therapies.",1
"Acute bronchitis, an illness frequently encountered by primary-care physicians, is an inflammation of the tracheobronchial tree that results from a respiratory tract infection. It is characterized by persistent cough and sputum production and is occasionally accompanied by fever and/or chest pain. Acute bronchitis may have a viral or bacterial origin and is often treated with antibiotics. Four clinical trials were conducted to compare high and low doses of loracarbef, a new oral β-lactam antibiotic, with three agents commonly used to treat acute bronchitis: amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, and amoxicillin. Results of these studies indicated that loracarbef, 400 and 200 mg twice daily, had clinical and bacteriologic efficacy against the common respiratory pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis that was comparable with that of the comparative agents. Loracabef was as well tolerated as cefaclor and amoxicillin; moreover, it produced a significantly lower incidence of diarrhea than did amoxicillin/clavulanate. Loracarbef may be considered a safe and effective alternative agent for the treatment of patients with acute bronchitis.",1
"An assay for the microsomal hydroxylation of lauric acid (LA), based on HPLC with flow-through radiochemical detection, has been developed. Conditions were optimized for resolution and quantitation of three microsomal metabolites of LA, one of which has not been reported previously as a metabolite of LA in mammalian microsomal incubations. These products, 12-(ω)-hydroxy-LA, 11-(ω-1)-hydroxy-LA, and a novel metabolite, 10-(ω-2)-hydroxy-LA, were isolated by HPLC and identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. In the presence of NADPH, the formation of all three metabolites was linear with time and microsomal protein concentration. Hydrogen peroxide also supported the microsomal metabolism of LA, although the ratio of metabolites was substantially different than that produced by NADPH-supported microsomes. Several biochemical probes (metyrapone, α-naphthoflavone, 2-diethylaminoethyl-2,2-diphenylvalerate hydrochloride, and 10-undecynoic acid) were used to dissociate the three LA hydroxylase activities. These experiments suggest that the site-specific hydroxylation [ω-, (ω-1)-, (ω-2)-] of LA may be catalyzed by different isozymes of cytochrome P-450.",1
"Phospholipid vesicles containing bovine heart mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COV) were characterized for electron transfer and proton translocating activities in the presence of the mobile potassium ionophore, valinomycin, and the channel-forming ionophore, gramicidin, in order to determine if the ionophores modify the functional properties of the enzyme. In agreement with previous work, incubation of COV with valinomycin resulted in a perturbation of the absorbance spectrum of oxidized heme aa 3 in the Soret region (430 nm); gramicidin had no effect on the heme aa 3 absorbance spectrum. Different concentrations of the two ionophores were required for maximum respiratory control ratios in COV; 40- to 70-fold higher concentrations of valinomycin were required to completely uncouple electron transfer activity when compared to gramidicin. The proton translocating activity of COV incubated with each ionophore gave a similar apparent proton translocated to electron transferred stoichiometry ( H+ e− ratio) of 0.66 ± 0.10. However, COV treated with low concentrations of gramicidin (0.14 mg/g phospholipid) exhibited 1.5- to 2.5-fold higher rates of alkalinization of the extravesicular media after the initial proton translocation reaction than did COV treated with valinomycin, suggesting that gramicidin allows more rapid equilibration of protons across the phospholipid bilayer during the proton translocation assay. Moreover, at higher concentrations of gramicidin (1.4 mg/g phospholipid), the observed H+ e− ratio decreased to 0.280 ± 0.020, while the rate of alkalinization increased an additional 2-fold, suggesting that at higher concentrations, gramicidin acts as a proton ionophore. These results support the hypothesis that cytochrome c oxidase is a redox-linked proton pump that operates at similar efficiencies in the presence of either ionophore. Low concentrations of gramicidin dissipate the membrane potential in COV most likely by a channel mechanism that is different from the carrier mechanism of valinomycin, yet does not make the phospholipid bilayer freely permeable to protons.",1
"Bovine renal brush-border membrane vesicle aminopeptidase N at various stages of purity was treated with two bifunctional cross-linking agents. A pattern of emergence of higher molecular weight forms was observed. By using a cleavable cross-linker, aminopeptidase N was shown to cross-link both to itself and to its breakdown products as well as to dipeptidyl peptidase IV. Using this technique it was possible to identify three of the breakdown products as 45 kDa, 66 kDa and 95 kDa peptides. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis was used to define the precise cleavage points for the bovine renal aminopeptidase N breakdown products. The short amino acid sequences obtained show strong sequence similarity with the human intestinal and rat kidney aminopeptidase N.",1
"Nine hybridoma cell lines secreting antibodies against the maize leaf nitrate reductase have been distinguished by reciprocal competition for binding to the antigenic site. Inhibition of enzymatic activities, and western blots of native enzyme and denatured subunits revealed different behaviors of individual antibodies towards the antigen. Two classes of monoclonal antibodies are inhibitory of NADH and methyl viologen nitrate reductase activities, but only one affects also NADH cytochrome c reductase activity. The associated epitopes are sensitive to antigen conformation. Among the 4 other classes, one is specific for the native conformation of the molecule, another binds more strongly to the denatured antigen, and two recognize equally well the two forms.",1
"We describe a program for protein sequence analysis which runs in IBM PC computers. Protein sequences are loaded from files in Mount-Conrad and Lipman-Pearson format. Seven features are analyzed: hydrophilicity, hydropathy, surface probability, side chain flexibility, antigenicity, secondary structure and N-glycosylation sites. Numeric results can be shown, printed or stored in files exportable to other programs. Graphics of up to four predictions can be displayed on the screen, printed out or plotted, with several definable options. This program has been designed to be fast, user-friendly and to be shared with the scientific community.",1
"Dieldrin (36 mg/kg body weight) administered intraperitoneally prolonged recovery from infection with mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3) in the genetically-resistant A/J strain, affected the humoral anti-MHV3 IgG immune response, and inhibited the intrinsic antiviral activity of peritoneal macrophages upon in vitro rechallenge with the virus. Infection of untreated A/J animals and vehicle controls with MHV3 resulted in marked and reproducible activation of peritoneal macrophages, observed in vitro as resistance to MHV3-cytopathic effects 48 hr after rechallenge with the virus, whereas exposure to dieldrin resulted in apparent loss of the intrinsic capacity of cells to restrict replication of MHV3 and to protect them from cytolysis. In addition, in vitro treatment of MHV3 virus-activated macrophages with dieldrin, mitomycin C and X-irradiation, inhibited the intrinsic capacity of cells to restrict MHV3 replication. This mechanism of cellular restriction of the virus by MHV3-activated macrophages from the resistant A/J strain appeared to be one of the sensitive targets for the suppressive action of dieldrin on host resistance, as (i) no major changes in macrophage cellular parameters were observed in in vitro studies of cell viability, adherence to plastic, and Superoxide anion generation; (ii) the increased cell yield in the peritoneal exudates during MHV3 virus infection was not affected by dieldrin exposure; and (iii) the attachment and uptake of [3H]MHV3 by virus-activated macophages was shown to be unchanged by dieldrin exposure.",1
"Carbocyclic cytidine (C-Cyd) is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent active against DNA viruses [pox (vaccinia)], (+)RNA viruses [toga (Sindbis, Semliki forest), corona], (−)RNA viruses [orthomyxo (influenza), paramyxo (parainfluenza, measles), rhabdo (vesicular stomatitis)] and (±)RNA viruses (reo). The target enzyme of C-Cyd is supposed to be CTP synthetase that converts UTP to CTP. In keeping with this assumption are the observations that (i) C-Cyd effects a dose-dependent inhibition of RNA synthesis in both virus-infected and uninfected cells, and (ii) exogenous addition of either Urd or Cyd reverses both the antiviral and cytocidal activity of C-Cyd, whereas addition of dThd or dCyd fails to do so. The selectivity of C-Cyd against Sindbis, vesicular stomatitis and reo virus is markedly increased when C-Cyd is combined with Cyd (10 μg/mL). This combination may therefore be worth pursuing as a chemotherapeutic modality for the treatment of virus infections.",1
"A series of N-hydroxy-N′-aminoguanidine (HAG) derivatives were studied and compared for their effects on ribonucleotide reductase activity in cell-free extracts; on nucleic acid synthesis and the growth of human colon carcinoma HT-29 cells; and on mouse leukemia L1210 cells in culture. The HAG derivatives [RCHNNHC(NH)NHOH-tosylate] studied could be grouped as; (1) hydroxy-benzylidines; (2) methoxybenzylidines; and (3) nitrobenzylidines substituted at the R position. 2′-Hydroxybenzylidine-HAG, the lead compound, was relatively active in both HT-29 cells and L1210 cells (20 ± 5 and 13 ± 4 μM for 50% inhibition of HT-29 and L1210 cell growth respectively). The monohydroxybenzylidene compounds were generally more active than the dihydroxy- and trihy-droxybenzylidene-HAG derivatives. The methoxybenzylidene-HAGs were as active as the monohy-droxybenzylidene-HAGs. 2′-Hydroxy-4′-methoxybenzylidene-HAG was much more active than 2′,4′-dihydroxybenzylidene-HAG. The mononitrobenzylidene-HAGs were more active than the dinitro-benzylidene-HAG compound. In general, L1210 cells were more sensitive to the effects of the HAG compounds than were HT-29 cells. There was good agreement between the concentration of drug required to inhibit the growth of HT-29 cells and that required to inhibit the growth of L1210 cells. There was also good correlation between the ability of HAG derivatives to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase activity and to inhibit tumor cell growth. Some derivatives, such as 2′,3′,4′- and 3′,4′,5′-trihydroxybenzylidene-HAG inhibited L1210 cell growth by 50% at lower concentrations (7.8 and 11.9 μM respectively) than the concentrations needed for 50% inhibition of HT-29 cell growth (196 and 234 μM respectively) and ribonucleotide reductase activity (122 and 188 μM respectively). The studies of nucleic acid synthesis in L1210 cells using [3H]cytidine as a precursor showed that 2′,3′,4′-trihy-droxybenzylidine-HAG inhibited DNA synthesis at a lower concentration (29 μM for 50% inhibition) than was needed for the inhibition of RNA synthesis and formation of [3H]deoxycytidine nucleotides in the acid-soluble fraction (320 and 820 μM for 50% inhibition respectively). These results indicate that 2′,3′,4′-trihydroxybenzylidine-HAG inhibits DNA synthesis in L1210 cells through other mechanisms rather than exclusively through the inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase activity.",1
"Topsentin, a bis(indolyl)imidazole marine natural product, inhibited the proliferation of cultured human and murine tumor cells at micromolar concentrations (ic50 values ranged from 4 to 40 μM) and was active against in vivo P388 leukemia (% T C = 137, 150 mg/kg , QD1-5) and B16 melanoma (% T C = 144, 37.5 mg/kg , QD1-9) tumors. Effects of 30 μM topsentin (1-hr exposures) on incorporation of radiolabeled precursors by P388 cells indicated inhibition of DNA synthesis (91%) and to a lesser extent RNA synthesis (57%), whereas synthesis of protein was unaffected (0%). Fluorescence spectral changes and competitive binding experiments with ethidium bromide indicated that topsentin interacted with DNA. No evidence for intercalation was observed in DNA unwinding studies, but competitive binding experiments with Hoechst 33342 and CC-1065 indicated that topsentin bound to DNA in the minor groove.",1
"Cyclopentenylcytosine (Ce-Cyd) is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent active against DNA viruses [herpes (cytomegalo), pox (vaccinia)], (+)RNA viruses [picorna (polio, Coxsackie, rhino), toga (Sindbis, Semliki forest), corona], (−)RNA viruses [orthomyxo (influenza), paramyxo (parainfluenza, measles), arena (Junin, Tacaribe), rhabdo (vesicular stomatitis)] and (±)RNA viruses (reo). Ce-Cyd is a more potent antiviral agent than its saturated counterpart, cyclopentylcytosine (carbodine, C-Cyd). Ce-Cyd also has potent cytocidal activity against a number of tumor cell lines. The putative target enzyme for both the antiviral and antitumor action of Ce-Cyd is assumed to be the CTP synthetase that converts UTP to CTP. In keeping with this hypothesis was the finding that the antiviral and cytocidal effects of Ce-Cyd are readily reversed by Cyd and, to a lesser extent, Urd, but not by other nucleosides such as dThd or dCyd. In contrast, pyrazofurin and 6-azauridine, two nucleoside analogues that are assumed to interfere with OMP decarboxylase, another enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of pyrimidine ribonucleotides, potentiate the cytocidal activity of Ce-Cyd. Ce-Cyd should be further pursued, as such and in combination with OMP decarboxylase inhibitors, for its therapeutic potential in the treatment of both viral and neoplastic diseases.",1
"The effects of a range of metallopeptidase inhibitors on the activities of the porcine kidney cell surface zinc aminopeptidases, aminopeptidase A (AP-A; EC 3.4.11.2), aminopeptidase N (AP-N; EC 3.4.11.7) and aminopeptidase W (AP-W; EC 3.4.11.16), have been directly compared. Amastatin and probestin were effective against all three aminopeptidases, with the concentration of inhibitor required to cause 50% inhibition (I50) in the low micromolar range (I50 = 1.5–20 μM), except for probestin with AP-N which displayed an I50 of 50 nM. Actinonin failed to inhibit significantly either AP-A or AP-W, and thus can be considered a relatively selective inhibitor (I50 = 2.0 μM of AP-N. In contrast, bestatin was a relatively poor inhibitor of AP-N (I50 = 89 μm) and failed to inhibit AP-A, but was more potent towards AP-W (I50 = 7.9 μM). Thus, some of the observed chemotherapeutic actions of bestatin may be due to inhibition of cell-surface AP-W. A number of other metallopeptidase inhibitors, including inhibitors of endopeptidase-24.11 (EC 3.4.24.11) and membrane dipeptidase (EC 3.4.13.11), and the carboxylalkyl and phosphoryl inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1) failed to inhibit significantly AP-A, AP-N or AP-W. However, AP-W was inhibited with I50 values in the micromolar range by the sulphydryl converting enzyme inhibitors rentiapril (I50 = 1.6 μM), zofenoprilat (I50 = 7.0 μM) and YS 980 (I50 = 17.7 μM). Neither AP-A nor AP-N were affected by these sulphydryl compounds. Inhibition of AP-W may account for some of the side effects noted with the clinical use of the sulphydryl converting enzyme inhibitors. The availability of compounds which are totally selective for AP-W over any of the other mammalian cell surface zinc aminopeptidases may aid in identifying endogenous substrates, and thus physiological or pathophysiological role(s) of AP-W.",1
"Limbic encephalitis as a distinct clinicopathological entity is becoming increasingly familiar to neurologists. However, despite its classical clinical presentation of mental status changes and behavioral abnormalities, the disorder is not well known in the psychiatric literature and premortem diagnosis is rare. We recently participated in the care of a patient who spent two months on a psychiatric service and in whom a medical disorder was consistently suspected but not confirmed until autopsy revealed paraneoplasic limbic encephalitis and two primary systemic malignancies. A detailed neuropsychiatric description of this clinical entity is provided from presentation to autopsy with review of the literature.",1
"Fast and slow axonal transport of protein have been studied in the optic nerves of mice infected with Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) that causes patchy demyelination throughout the CNS. Intravitreal injections of [3H]proline were given at regular intervals after virus inoculation, the labelled protein in the superior colliculi was then measured after survival periods of 18 h or 10 days, for fast and slow axonal transport studies, respectively. Fast transport studies showed an enhanced amount of protein arriving at the optic nerve terminals (superior colliculus) of the SFV-infected mice prior to the onset of demyelination. In contrast, the slow transport studies showed an enhanced amount of protein at the superior colliculus of the SFV-infected mice during the demyelination period. There was no concomitant increase in labelled protein in the retina at any time after the SFV infection. It is proposed that alteration in the transport of the protein constituents other than major myelin specific components may cause disruption of myelin maintenance in SFV infection.",1
"We found that astrocytes expressed the α subtype of protein kinase C. Treatment with12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) caused cultured astrocytes to proliferate. This effect of TPA was blocked by staurosporine, a potent protein kinase C inhibitor, suggesting the involvement of protein kinase C in astrocyte proliferation. Indomethacin, an inhibitor of prostaglandin formation, enhanced both the normal and TPA-induced proliferation of astrocytes. Authentic prostaglandin E2 blocked this effect of indomethacin and also partially blocked the effect of TPA, suggesting that the intracellular mechanisms involved in prostaglandin E2-regulated astrocyte growth might differ from those acting in protein kinase-dependent growth. The effect of prostaglandin E2 was blocked by a specific anti-prostaglandin E2 polyclonal antibody. Cultured astrocytes and microglia produced and released prostaglandin E2 in response to stimulants such as lipopolysaccharide, TPA, and lymphokines. Since the sensitivity of astrocytes and microglia to these stimuli was different, prostaglandin E2 may differentially regulate astrocyte proliferation under different physiological conditions, acting in an autocrine fashion for astrocytes and in a paracrine fashion for microglia.",1
"The Golgi apparatus-complex (GA), is a key organelle involved in several posttranslational modifications of polypeptides destined for lysosomes, plasma membranes and secretion. As reported from this laboratory, certain astrocytes in rat brain contain cisternae of the GA not only in perikarya, but also in processes. In order to further investigate which type of astrocytes contain GA in processes we conducted the present study using primary cultures of rat astrocytes and organelle specific antibodies against the GA and the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). While the perikarya of all cells contained elements of the GA, only a single process of a subset of type I astrocytes, negative to antibodies A2B5 and HNK-1, contained GA. In contrast, elements of the RER were found within perikarya and all processes. In order to confirm that the immunostained structures in processes indeed represent the GA, we exposed cultures to Brefeldin A (BFA), a secretion blocker which disperses the GA and redistributes it to the RER. We observed that BFA disrupted the GA of both perikarya and processes. However, astrocytes were resistant to prolonged incubations with BFA, while a similar treatment killed cultured fibroblasts and PC-12 cells. Furthermore, in astrocytes exposed to BFA for several days, the delicate network of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), was replaced by large perinuclear masses of the protein. These observations demonstrate that a subset of type I astrocytes have a single process with elements of the GA. We suggest that this specialization of the GA may be related to yet unrecognized secretory or protein processing functions of these cells. The resistance of astrocytes to BFA and the striking changes in their cytoskeleton induced by the drug, may contribute to studies on the mechanism(s) of action of BFA.",1
"Astrocytes produce granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and support the survival and proliferation of microglia. To study the functions of GM-CSF in the central nervous system (CNS), we examined the effects of GM-CSF on cytokine production by glial cells. GM-CSF induced interleukin-6 (IL-6) production by microglia, but not by astrocytes, in a dose-dependent manner as assessed by bioassay and the detection of IL-6 mRNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. GM-CSF did not induce tumor necrosis factor (TNF)a or IL-1 in microglia and astrocytes, whereas lipopolysaccharide induced all these cytokines. The induction of IL-6 by GM-CSF in microglia was completely inhibited by antibodies to GM-CSF. Neither IL-3 nor macrophage-CSF (M-CSF) induced IL-6 production in microglia. Given that IL-1 and TNFα, monokines derived from microglia, induce IL-6 production in astrocytes, but not in microglia, results indicate that astrocytes and microglia may mutually regulate IL-6 production by different cytokines.",1
"Faeces are not always uniform in consistency. Many owners believe that variations in faecal consistency are abnormal, but consistency may vary during one evacuation, i.e. initially firm but latterly soft, or over the day, e.g. the initial morning faeces are frequently firmer than those passed later in the day. It is normal for a dog to defaecate more than twice daily. The accepted range of normality for the dog and cat is one to four times daily although this depends on the diet. The faecal output of a dog fed on a dry, complete diet may be twice that on a meat-based diet. The addition of dog biscuit to the meat has little effect upon faecal bulk as most biscuit is low in fibre.",1
"The first two articles in this series have covered the basis of the immune mediated diseases, systemic immune-mediated diseases and those that involve the haemolymphatic and musculoskeletal system. The purpose of this article is to cover the immune-mediated diseases that involve the integumentary, urogenital, endocrine and vascular systems.",1
"This study describes the isolation and characterization of an influenza virus subtype H3N2 designated A/Swine/Weybridge/163266/87. The virus was isolated from a severe outbreak of respiratory disease in East Anglia. Haemagglutinin and neuraminidase characterization showed the virus to be very similar to H3N2 strains circulating in the human population during the years 1972–1975, and to H3N2 strains recently isolated from pigs in Belgium and France. A serological survey showed antibodies to the virus to be present in 31% of pigs tested, and reactors were detected on 43% of farms sampled.",1
"Published reference ranges for blood biochemistry in swine generally do not relate to sows in modern breeding units, and results were often obtained by methods that are now outdated. The ranges widely used in clinical practice reflect these inappropriate sources. The data presented here were obtained using modern methods of analysis on blood samples from healthy, conventionally managed sows from six breeding herds of known disease status in eastern England, and thus represent appropriate ranges for this class of swine. The values differ from earlier reports principally in higher values for total bilirubin, creatine kinase, and more particularly of total plasma and serum proteins. The latter are shown to be due to higher immunoglobulin concentrations than those previously reported.",1
"A competition ELISA utilizing a mAb directed towards a peplomer protein epitope common to TGEV, PRCV and related feline and canine coronaviruses is described.",1
"Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), previously known as feline T-lymphotropic lentivirus (FTLV), was first described by Pedersen et al. (1987) who isolated the virus from cats with a variety of clinical signs suggestive of immunodeficiency. Since then FIV has become one of the most studied feline viruses, not least because of its similarity to human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) which cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in man.",1
"The causative agent of the respiratory disease equine viral arteritis is a small, single-stranded RNA virus with a genome organization and replication strategy related to that of coronaviruses and toroviruses. Clinical signs of infection in horses vary widely and severe infection can lead to pregnant mares aborting. Infected horses generally make good recoveries but stallions may become semen shedders of equine arteritis virus (EAV). These carrier stallions play an important role in the dissemination and perpetuation of EAV. Laboratory tests exist to detect virus and the equine immune response to infection. However, vaccines are not currently licensed in the UK to combat viral arteritis, the incidence of which may increase due to changes in European legislation.",1
"Selected, recent research on the following avian diseases, and their causative viruses, has been reviewed: chicken anaemia, infectious bursal disease, turkey rhinotracheitis, avian nephritis, fowlpox, influenza, infectious bronchitis and turkey enteritis.",1
"Multiple sclerosis (MS) and a number of related distinctive diseases are characterized by the active degradation of central nervous system (CNS) myelin, an axonal sheath comprised essentially of proteins and lipids. These demyelinating diseases appear to arise from complex interactions of genetic, immunological, infective, and biochemical mechanisms. While circumstances of MS etiology remain hypothetical, one persistent theme involves recognition by the immune system of myelin-specific antigens derived from myelin basic protein (MBP), the most abundant extrinsic myelin membrane protein, and/or another equally susceptible myelin protein or lipid component. Knowledge of the biochemical and physical—chemical properties of myelin proteins and lipids, particularly their composition, organization, structure, and accessibility with respect to the compacted myelin multilayers, thus becomes central to the understanding of how and why these antigens become selected during the development of MS. This review focuses on current understanding of the molecular basis underlying demyelinating disease as it may relate to the impact of the various protein and lipid components on myelin morphology; the precise molecular architecture of this membrane as dictated by protein—lipid and lipid—lipid interactions; and the relationship, if any, between the protein/lipid components and the destruction of myelin in pathological situations.",1
"Substantial data collected from large numbers of accessions, the need for comprehensive reporting of negative as well as positive laboratory findings, and the necessity for obtaining rapid diagnostic correlations prompted the development of a computer based system of accession data management for collection, storage, rapid retrieval, reporting, concording, and administrative compiling in a state-university Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory.",1
"The morphology and morphogenesis of virus strain LY-138 recovered from neonatal diarrheic calves were investigated by electron microscopy using negativestaining techniques and ultrathin sectioning. Purified viral particles were spherical in shape and measured 90 nm in average diameter in negatively stained preparations. Pleomorphic forms were also present. The virions had envelopes with petal-shaped projections characteristic of coronaviruses. In ultrathin sections, cores in viral factories were round with a diameter of 50–60 nm. Most of these cores were electron dense but some had an electron-lucent center. In cytoplasmic vacuoles, Golgi vesicles, and on the apical plasmalemma of intestinal epithelial cells, the virions were round or ellipsoidal in shape, measuring 70–80 nm in diameter, and had fine thread-like projections on their surfaces. Uptake of virus occurred through fusion of viral envelopes with the plasmalemma of the microvillous border or by entry into intercellular spaces and interaction with the lateral cell membranes of adjacent intestinal epithelial cells. As a result of this interaction, the lateral cell membranes became altered and ill-defined. During the early stage of infection, the rough andasmooth elements of the endoplasmic reticulum became distended with electron-dense granulofibrillar material. This material accumulated subsequently as well-defined, smooth membrane-bound areas mainly in the apical cytoplasm of infected cells. These structures were considered to be viral factories. The morphogenesis of virus occurred mainly through condensation of the electron-dense, granulo-fibrillar material into viral cores in cytoplasmic viral factories or within the distended cisternes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Viral envelopment occurred on membranes of cytoplasmic vacuoles, Golgi vesicles, or in association with membranes of viral factories. Release of virus from infected cells occurred by lysis and fragmentation of the apical plasmalemma and flow of the cytoplasm with its contents into the gut lumen. Release also occurred by digestion and lysis of extruded infected cells or by fusion of virus-containing cytoplasmic vacuoles with the apical plasmalemma and liberation of their contents.",1
"Ultrastructural aspects of St. Louis encephalitis virus infection of the major extraneutral organs and tissues of suckling hamsters were examined. In the pancreas, both the exocrine and endocrine portions were equally affected by the virus. A feature apparently unique to flaviviruses was the accumulation of virus particles in all types of secretory granules in this organ. Virus particles were seen within myocardial fibers and within the smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells of small blood vessels of the heart. In the intestines, the lamina propria was the most severely infected, with virus particles accumulated in all cell types.",1
"Wistar rats were inoculated subcutaneously with either type 1 (HSV1) or type 2 (HSV2) Herpes simplex virus at 5 days of age. Animals were killed in extremis or at the end of the 14-day observation period postinoculation. Acute destructive meningoencephalitis with hemorrhage and leukocytic infiltration was observed in both groups. Polycaryocytes comprised of cells of the internal granular layer of the cerebellum were observed in some animals inoculated with HSV1. These multinucleated cells appeared to be formed by fusion of virus-infected cells, and intranuclear inclusion bodies were observed. Lesions in the leptomeninges were particularly striking in animals inoculated with HSV2. Viral replication in resident cells of the leptomeninges was demonstrated by electron microscopy.",1
"A murine model to study enteritis induced by bovine (BRV) and murine rotavirus (MRV) has been developed. The course of infection was determined by clinical symptoms of diarrhea and virus isolation as well as histopathological, immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic methods. Both isolates were able to replicate and produce clinical symptoms in neonatal mice. Rotavirus-free neonates were orally inoculated with MRV or BRV and observed over a 192-hr postinoculation (HPI) period. Following infection with 104 PFU of virus, diarrhea and maximal intestinal dysfunction, as measured by xylose absorption, did not occur until beyond 20 hr postinfection even though maximal virus production occurred at 10–15 HPI. Immunohistochemically and by electron microscopy we were able to demonstrate viral antigen and virus particles in the enterocytes of villous tips at 5–8 HPI. The appearance of diarrheal symptoms was dependent on the virus dose and the type of virus isolate inoculated. The disease could be induced with doses as low as 1 × 102 PFU/mouse of BRV and 1 × 101 PFU/mouse of MRV. On the basis of these results, MRV was found to be more virulent than BRV in this model. The model should prove useful for studies designed to assess rotavirus virulence genes and for vaccine protection studies. This work emphasizes the need for early sample collection for critical evaluation of any vaccine or antiviral agent using this model.",1
"Expression of bovine coronavirus (BCV) antigen in the plasmalemma of epithelioid human rectal tumor (HRT-18) and fibroblastic bovine fetal spleen (BFS) cell lines was traced by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy facilitated by colloidal gold. Cytoplasmic fluorescence was first observed at 12 hr postinfection (h.p.i) in infected HRT-18 cultures. This fluorescence coincided with the appearance of cell surface antigen reacting with colloidal gold-labeled antibodies to BCV antigens. At 24 h.p.i the amount of viral antigens at the surface of HRT-18 had increased, although cytoplasmic fluorescence remained constant. Infected BFS cells but not HRT-18 cells formed polykaryons when incubated in the presence of trypsin. One viral antigen in the plasma membrane of BFS cells was thus identified as the S glycoprotein with a fusion domain. In contrast to HRT-18 cells, the overall amount of BCV antigens at the surface of BFS cells remained constant after the onset of fusion. Analysis of the labeling characteristics established that the goldmarked-sites represented de novo expression of BCV antigen in the plasma membrane of infected cells.",1
"Disulfide-linked conjugates of poliovirus with streptavidin or concanavalin A were formed and the binding of the conjugates to mouse L cells that lack natural poliovirus receptors was studied. The conjugate with streptavidin was specifically bound to biotinylated L cells, but not to unmodified L cells. The conjugate with conA was bound to L cells in the absence of, but not in the presence of α-methyl mannoside. Incubation of L cells with bound conjugates did not produce virus, although the conjugates were highly infectious in HeLa cells, containing natural poliovirus receptors. This suggests that the artificially bound virus was unable to penetrate the L cells and start replication. The possibility that binding of the virus to the natural receptor is required for efficient infection is discussed.",1
"Rhodopsin's oligosaccharide chains contain predominantly two types of sugar residues: mannose and N-acetylglucosamine. In the present work, bovine and rat rhodopsin were analysed biochemically for the presence of a third sugar, galactose. Treatment of bovine rod outer segments (ROS) with galactose oxidase followed by reduction with tritium-labeled sodium borohydride revealed the presence of existing molecules of galactose on rhodopsin. Rats injected intravitreally with [3H]galactose and [14C]leucine and maintained in darkness were killed 1 hr, 6 hr, 1, 3, or 5 days following the injection. Retinas were collected for subcellular fractionation and rhodopsin from each of the fractions was purified by ConA sepharose chromatography and SDS-PAGE. During the first 6 hr, galactose selectively labeled rhodopsin in the Golgi-enriched fraction resulting in increased [3H] [14C] ratios in both Golgi and ROS. The data suggested that trimming was occurring at the transition from Golgi to ROS. Furthermore, a decrease in isotope ratio in the ROS between 6 hr and 1 day suggested further trimming of rhodopsin after membrane assembly in the ROS. Additional in vivo experiments demonstrated existing molecules of galactose on rhodopsin's oligosaccharide chain using lectin affinity chromatography. Rats injected intravitreally with [35S]methionine were dark-adapted for 2 hr. Following subcellular fractionation of retinas, ConA purified rhodopsin from ROS was applied to one of two additional lectin columns: Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA) or Griffonia simplicifolia I (GSA). Eight to nine per cent of the labeled rhodopsin was bound to and eluted from RCA, whereas none bound to GSA, indicating the presence of a β-galactoside. The RCA agarose eluted protein co-electrophoresed with a rhodopsin standard and was light sensitive. Galactose was shown to be the terminal sugar on this subset of rhodopsin and was not capped by neuraminic acid. Binding of rhodopsin's oligosaccharide to RCA was abolished by pre-treatment with β-galactosidase. Decreased binding of rhodopsin to RCA was observed following intravitreal injection of castanospermine but not swainsonine. Of those two inhibitors of glycoprotein trimming, only castanospermine would be expected to prevent the addition of galactose to the oligosaccharide. The association of galactose with rat rhodopsin appeared to be a transient one. At 2 hr, 8–9% of rhodopsin contained galactose, at 6 hr only 2·2% had galactose and by 24 hr less than 1% did. The galactose was trimmed from rhodopsin's oligosaccharide presumably after its role was complete. Separation of rhodopsin of the plasma membranes from rhodopsin of discs indicated that 75% of the galactose-containing rhodopsin was in the plasma membrane and only 25% was in the discs. These findings suggested a possible role for galactose in new disc formation with subsequent removal after the discs are sealed.",1
"The expression of immune-associated (MHC class II) antigen was studied immunohistochemically over several months in the rat facial nucleus after nerve transection and after intraneural injection of toxic ricin. Cells expressing Ia antigen were of a perivascular type and parenchymal ramified microglia. In the first few weeks after nerve lesions we observed a gradual increase in the number of Ia-immunoreactive cells starting with an initial appearance of Ia-positive perivascular cells which were succeeded by increasing numbers of Ia-positive ramified microglia. In long-term animals Ia expression was almost exclusively found in microglia. We propose (a) the existence of a population of immunocompetent perivascular cells normally present in adult rat brain that can be stimulated to express Ia antigen, and (b) the existence of a subpopulation of ramified microglia that arises through transformation of Ia-positive perivascular cells in the adult under pathological conditions.",1
"Computer analysis of the intrinsic membrane protein, myelin proteolipid, shows strong sequence similarities between the putative extramembrane segments of the proteolipid protein and a number of viral proteins, several of which infect humans. These similarities are even more striking than those reported previously between viral proteins and the encephalitogenic myelin basic protein (MBP). These findings, along with other reports of molecular mimicry by viruses, suggest that immunological cross-reactions between virus-induced antibodies or T-cells and analogous antigenic determinants (epitopes) in myelin proteolipid could be involved in the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis or post-infectious demyelinating syndromes.",1
An increasing number of examples of translational regulation at the level of termination has been recently reported in eukaryotes. This paper reviews our present knowledge on this topic and proposes an understanding of these regulations by relating the study of viral gene expression to a comprehensive view of the mechanisms and components of the translational process.,1
"A statistically significant similarity was demonstrated between the amino acid sequences of 4 Escherichia coli helicases and helicase subunits, a family of non-structural proteins of eukaryotic positive-strand RNA viruses and 2 herpesvirus proteins all of which contain an NTP-binding sequence motif. Based on sequence analysis and secondary structure predictions, a generalized structural model for the ATP-binding core is proposed. It is suggested that all these proteins constitute a superfamily of helicases (or helicase subunits) involved in NTP-dependent duplex unwinding during DNA and RNA replication and recombination.",1
"On the assumption that dephosphorylation of the neurotropic coronavirus JHM (JHMV) nucleocapsid protein (N) may be connected with initiation of the infectious cycle we searched for a relevant host enzyme activity. Analysis of subcellular fractions from L-2 murine fibroblasts, separated by dual Percoll density gradients, revealed the presence of a phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPPase), co-sedimenting with the endososomal/prelysosomal material, which possesses high activity against N. With purified [22P]N as substrate it was demonstrated that this PPPase, distinguishable from acid and alkaline phosphatases, acts optimally at neutral pH in the presence of Mn2+ following treatment with a detergent. Complete inhibition with okadaic acid at 0.9–4.5 μM but not at 1–10 nM relegates this PPase to a type I protein phosphatase. Similar PPPase activity for N was present in the endosome fraction of a rat Roc-1 astrocytoma-oligodendrocyte cell line and in homogenates of brain and cultured oligodendrocytes. Our data suggest that the phosphorylated N of the inoculum may be modified by the endosomal PPPase in host cells, including those from the CNS so as to facilitate the JHMV infectious process.",1
"A computer-assisted comparative analysis of the amino acid sequences of (putative) thiol proteases encoded by the genomes of several diverse groups or positive-stranded RNA viruses and distantly related to the family of cellular papain-like proteases is presented. A high level of similarity was detected between the leader protease of foot-and-mouth-disease virus and the protease of murine hepatitis coronavirus which cleaves the N-terminal p28 protein from the polyprotein. Statistically significant alignment of a portion of the rubella virus polyprotein with cellular papain-like proteases was obtained, leading to tentative identification of the papain-like protease as the enzyme mediating processing of the non-structural proteins of this virus. Specific grouping between the sequences of the proteases of α-viruses, and poty- and bymoviruses was revealed. It was noted that papain-like proteases of positive-stranded RNA viruses are much more variable both in their sequences and in genomic locations than chymotrypsin-related proteases found in the same virus class. A novel conserved domain of unknown function has also been identified which flanks the papain-like proteases of α-, rubi- and coronaviruses.",1
"The enveloped baculovirus⧹insect cell system has been used extensively for expression of recombinant proteins. including viral fusion proteins. We tested wild-type baculovirus for endogenous fusion protein activity. Syncytia formation, dye transfer, and capacitance changes were observed after incubating infected Spodoptera frugiperda cells in acidic media, consistent with fusion protein activity. Only a short acidic pulse or 10 s is needed to trigger syncytia formation. Identical results were obtained with recombinant baculovirus. This new system convenient for studying pH activated cell-cell fusion. However, using this enveloped virus to study the mechanism of recombinant fusion proteins requires caution.",1
"Digestion of the proteinase inhibitor aprotinin, by clostripain, a cysteine proteinase, yielded five oligopeptide fragments. Two fragments exhibited both antiviral and antibacterial activities, two fragments only antiviral activity, and one fragment showed no antimicrobial activity. One of the former oligopeptides showed antiviral activity against human herpes simplex virus type 1 and bovine parainfluenza virus type 3. It consisted of the hexapeptide Y-F-Y-N-A-K corresponding to amino acids 21–26 of intact aprotinin. An identical synthetic peptide had the same antiviral spectrum as the natural hexapeptide, exhibited no antibacterial activity, and was also devoid of trypsin inhibiting activity. Intact aprotinin, in contrast, is ineffective against human herpes simplex virus 1 and bovine parainfluenza virus 3 but possesses antibacterial properties against several bacterial species [(1992) J. Appl. Bact. 72, 180–187].",1
"TGN38 and TGN41 are isoforms of a monotopic integral membrane protein which recycles between the trans Golgi network (TGN) and the cell surface, but which, at steady state, is predominantly located in the TGN. Full-length and truncated versions of rat TGN38/41 have been expressed in monkey (COS) and human (Heb7a) cells under the control of the heavy metal inducible Metallothionein IIA promoter. This has allowed the regulated expression of TGN38/41 protein constructs to different levels in the transfected cells. These studies show that (i) controlled overexpression of TGN38/41 results in mislocalisation to parts of the endocytic pathway, (ii) a truncated version of TGN38/41, lacking the cytoplasmic domain, remains in the TGN, and (iii) there is a direct or indirect interaction between the cytoplasmic domain of TGN38/41 and γ-adaptin.",1
"The intracellular disposition of the car☐y-terminus tail of rabbit lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (LPH) is demonstrated, using a specific phosphorylation of Ser1916 by protein kinase A (PKA). This phosphorylation is shown to occur not only in vitro (with pure LPH and pure catalytic subunit of PKA), but also in an organ culture of the small intestine. Cholera toxin, which is known to act in vivo on the membranes of the small intestine, with severe clinical consequences, and to elevate the intracellular cyclic AMP of enterocytes, is shown to enhance significantly the phosphorylation of LPH in intact cells grown as an organ culture. These findings establish the cytosolic orientation of the car☐yterminus tail of LPH in situ, and raise the possibility that the tail itself and its phosphorylation by PKA may have a physiological or physiopathological significance.",1
"Lactase and sucrase are two disaccharidases that differ not only in their substrate specificity and developmental patterns, but also in their resistance to mucosal insult. In this experiment, we tested the hypothesis that there might be a dichotomy in expression of enzyme activity along the jejunal villuscrypt unit. Sectioning of the villus-crypt unit in a cryostat enabled direct comparison of the distribution of lactase and sucrase enzyme activities in the adult rat. There is a stepwise increase in mean lactase/sucrase ratio going from crypt to villus. The data indicate that unlike sucrase activity, which is expressed maximally in enterocytes along the entire villus, maximal lactase activity is not attained until midvillus. The delay in expression of maximal lactase activity might help to explain the vulnerability of this enzyme to acute mucosal insult such as occurs in viral gastroenteritis.",1
"Four silver—silver chloride electrodes were surgically implanted at 5-cm intervals on the jejunal serosa of 7 neonatal pigs. Daily recordings, 7 h in duration, were made from each piglet beginning 3 days after surgery. Characteristic migrating motility complexes and short, distinct (2.5–5.0 s), rapidly aboral migrating bursts of intense spike activity (“migrating action potential complexes”) were seen in all preinfection recordings. Piglets were inoculated with a 1-ml oral dose of a 0.1% gut suspension from coronavirus (transmissible gastroenteritis) infected pigs. This resulted in inappetence, vomiting, and diarrhea, most marked on the second day postinfection, but which had abated by the third day. When compared to recordings from both fed and fasted noninfected (control) animals, infection significantly altered jejunal myoelectrical activity by (a) shortening the duration of the migrating motility complex on day 1 postinfection and prolonging it on day 2, (b) increasing the number of abnormal activity fronts, and (c) decreasing the number of migrating action potential complexes. Slow wave frequency and the duration of phase 3 of the migrating motility complex were unaffected. When compared to fed control animals, infected piglets also showed a slight shortening of phase 1 of the migrating motility complex on day 1 postinfection and a prolongation on days 2 and 3, as well as a shortening of phase 2 on the second and third days postinfection. Changes in myoelectrical activity were not solely due to decreases in food intake, as abnormalities persisted when food intake returned to normal on postinfection day 3, and disruption of the activity front and migrating motility complex duration were purely transmissible-gastroenteritis-virus-induced phenomena. These findings suggest that infection with transmissible gastroenteritis virus disrupts organized propulsive activity in the jejunum of the neonatal pig.",1

"Rotavirus enteritis is the leading cause of diarrhea in infants worldwide. A research priority of the World Health Organization is to develop oral rehydration solutions containing amino acids or other additives that will stimulate intestinal absorption more efficiently than the current glucose-based oral rehydration solutions. Glutamine is the principal metabolic fuel of the small bowel and a putative stimulator of mucosal repair. This report describes the transport response to mucosal l-glutamine following intestinal injury caused by porcine rotavirus. Peak symptoms and mucosal damage were observed 2–7 days after oral rotavirus inoculation. In vitro transport studies of the maximally injured region, the midjejunum (80% reduction in lactase), surprisingly, showed transport responses to l-glutamine (30 mmol/L) Sand l-alanine (30 mmol/L) that were similar qualitatively and quantitatively to those observed in control tissue. Subsequent application of mucosal d-glucose (30 mmol/L) caused additional stimulation of electrogenic Na+ transport, but the response to glucose was blunted (P < 0.05) in the infected tissues. Glutamine and alanine enhanced Na+ absorption to a similar degree (2–2.5 μEq · cm−2 · h−1), but glutamine stimulated equal amounts of electrogenic and electroneutral NaC1 absorption, whereas alanine had no significant effect on net Cl− flux. Glutamine is a potentially useful substrate for investigation in oral rehydration solutions for infant diarrhea.",1
"The effects of clonidine, an α 2-adrenergic agonist, and verapamil, a Ca2+ channel blocker, on Na2+ and Cl− absorption were studied in stripped jejunal mucosa from control and transmissible-gastroenteritis-virus-infected piglets. All infected piglets developed severe diarrhea 18–24 hours after oral inoculation. Jejunum from infected animals, as compared with control jejunum, had decreased mucosal-to-serosal, serosal-to-mucosal, and net Na+ and Cl− fluxes. Clonidine and verapamil caused a decrease in short-circuit current and stimulation of Na+ and Cl− absorption in control jejunum. In infected piglets, although the jejunum exhibited severe villus atrophy, both drugs stimulated Na+ and Cl− absorption and the magnitude of Na+ and Cl− absorption was similar in control and transmissible-gastroenteritis-infected jejunum. In contrast, d-glucose stimulated Na+ absorption, and the decrease in shortcircuit current caused by verapamil and clonidine, were decreased in transmissible-gastroenteritis-infected jejunum. Such pharmacological stimulation of Na+ and Cl− absorption might be useful in the management and treatment of certain viral diarrheal diseases.",1
"Background: Two French families were investigated. In the first a husband, wife, and 4 children had Crohn's disease; in the second 7 of 11 children had the disease. There was no history of Crohn's disease in antecedent generations and no linkage to HLA haplotypes. Methods: Methods included family interviews; review of medical records, radiographs, and pathology slides; serology; selective stool culture; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for fecal viral detection; and immunocytochemistry. Results: In both families multiple cases occurred among siblings in 7–13-month periods. There appeared to be a 4–8-year recurrence of new disease in both families. Radiographs showed a remarkable similarity in the pattern of disease, confined to distal ileum and cecum, in the members of family 1. Examination for pathology showed granulomas in all 8 patients for whom tissues were available. Acid-fast organisms or Campylobacter-like organisms were not found in tissue sections, and immunocytochemistry was negative for mycobacteria and Yersinia. Stool cultures were negative for mycobacteria, Yersinia, and Mycoplasma. Torovirus and coronavirus antigens were not found in stool. Serology was negative for antibodies to Brucella, Yersinia, influenza, and three enteropathogenic viruses of animals. Conclusions: The circumstances and data suggest that an infectious microorganism is responsible for these clusterings of Crohn's disease.",1
"Background/Aims Infectious agents have long been suspected of playing a role in the initiation of Crohn's disease. The objective of this study was to search for likely microbial agents in diseased tissues using immunocytochemical techniques. Methods Intestines and mesenteric lymph node specimens of 21 patients from two French families with a high frequency of Crohn's disease and from Connecticut were studied. The microbial agents searched for included Bacteroides vulgatus, Borrelia burgdorferi, Escherichia coil, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus spp., bovine viral diarrhea virus, influenza A virus, measles virus, parainfluenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus. Results Seventy-five percent of the patients with Crohn's disease (12 of 16) were positively labeled with the antibody to Listeria. Macrophages and giant cells immunolabeled for this antigen were distributed underneath ulcers, along fissures, around abscesses, within the lamina propria, in granulomas, and in the germinal centers of mesenteric lymph nodes. In addition, 57% (12 of 21) of the cases contained the E. coli antigen, and 44% (7 of 16) contained the streptococcal antigen. The immunolabeling for the latter two agents also occurred within macrophages and giant cells, distributed in a pattern similar to that of Listeria antigen. Conclusions The results suggest that Listeria spp., E. coli, and streptococci, but not measles virus, play a role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease.",1

"Antibodies against Crithidia fasciculata choanomastigotes were detected in green toad (Bufo viridis) sera by direct agglutination, indirect haemagglutination (IHA), complement-fixation test (CFT) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Correlation coefficients (r) were calculated for comparisons between each of the techniques and regression formulae derived in order to convert antibody levels as determined by one immunological method to that of another. The highest mean titre obtained by ELISA was approximately 1.5–3.5 times greater than those obtained by the other techniques whilst CFT gave the lowest values. IHA and ELISA titres were affected by different preparations of the crithidial antigen extracts. Highly significant r values were determined for control sera when IHA was compared to ELISA (r > 0.79), and to both CFT and ELISA with immune animals (r > 0.96). ELISA would seem most applicable for screening other lower vertebrates for anti-parasite antibodies especially in areas of human disease prevalence.",1
"Immunoblotting, SDS-PAGE and western biotting procedures were used to demonstrate cross-reactivity of a polyclonal anti-carp IgM antibody with components of roach serum. The polyclonal antibody labelled 2 major bands in both immune and normal roach sera corresponding to molecular mannes of approximately 90 and 65 kDa. One of these bands (65 kDa) was considered to be the heavy chain of fish immunoglobulin whilst the identity of the other remains uncertain. This cross-reaction has been exploited in immunofluorescence and immunogold labelling studies to localize fish host molecules on the tegumental membrane of Ligula intestinalis freshly removed from roach fry. Immunogold studies revealed a low level of host molecules to be associated mainly with the microthrix spines of the tegament with less gold labelling being observed on the microthrix shafts.",1
"Identification of diagnostic antigens for South American Babesia caballi infections. International Journal for Parasitology 24: 255–258. Sera from 60 horses held in breeding herd in Brazil were examined monthly by ELISA, immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) and Western blot. All foals had maternal antibodies detectable by ELISA and IFAT, and seroconversion took place between the 2nd and 5th month of age. The 48 and 50 kDa antigens were recognized first in the course of infection. Of 79 sera taken after sero-conversion 78 reacted with the 48 kDa antigen, 76 with the 50 kDa, 50 with the 70 kDa, 54 with the 112 kDa, 72 with the 141 kDa antigen. In general, sera from horses older than 1 year reacted with all 5 diagnostic antigen bands, but sera from horses older than 3 years only weakly. The antigens of 48 and 50 kDa appear to be conserved among all strains of B. caballi examined so far and are consistently recognized by all infected horses. They are the target antigens for a serological test based on anitigens produced by recombinant DNA techniques.",1
"From Babesia caballi in vitro cultures a preparation of 100% infected erythrocytes was obtained. From this, B. caballi antigens were extracted with the detergent 3-[(3-Cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonate (CHAPS) and used as ELISA antigens. A control antigen of normal erythrocytes from the same donor horse was prepared in an identical manner. The ELISA and Western blot were validated by testing of sera from horses experimentally infected with B. caballi or B. equi or not infected with Babesia spp. ELISA and Western blot results were compared with those obtained by the immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) and complement fixation test (CFT). The sensitivity of the ELISA of 98.3% obtained for sera from day 14 after infection was superior to the Western blot (94.9%), the IFAT (96.6%) and the CFT (28.8%). No positive results were obtained in the ELISA and Western blot with 106 sera from horses not infected with Babesia spp. resulting in a calculated specificity of 100% for both tests. Cross reactions of B. equi-positive sera did occur to a larger extent in the ELISA (20%) than in the IFAT (4%). No cross reactions were observed with the Western blot and the CFT. The higher sensitivity of the ELISA was also demonstrated by testing of 132 field sera: more positive results were obtained by ELISA (112) as compared to IFAT (92) or CFT (41). The validity of these results was confirmed by testing of sera by Western blot. The ELISA as the most sensitive test provides the best method for the identification of carrier horses to prevent the introduction into non-endemic areas (export testing). Positive ELISA results can be confirmed by Western blot, if a species-specific diagnosis is required.",1
"Five gnotobiotic piglets inoculated orally with porcine rotavirus developed an enteric lesion. Electron microscopy of the mucosal epithelium 12 h after inoculation showed that the virus penetrates into the absorptive cells between microvilli, possibly by a pinocytic mechanism. Afterwards, virus particles were most often seen within dilated cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). These infected cells showed a range of changes, such as disruption of the microvilli, loss of cytoplasmic density and deposition of lipid droplets. Subsequently, most of the epithelial cells were desquamated from the villi. The interaction of virus and intestinal cells thus indicates that rotavirus is pathogenic for the epithelial cells.",1
"Nephritis in chickens caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was studied by virological, histological and electron microscopical methods. The T strain of the virus caused only mild respiratory signs in both Rhode Island Red (RIR) and White Leghorn (WL) breeds; the 50 per cent mortality induced was due to acute nephritis. All the infected birds developed high titres of antibody to IBV for up to 30 weeks. In spite of the persistence of antibody, about 35 per cent of the RIR developed chronic progressive nephritis. The histology showed varying degrees of pathological changes in the tubules, with relatively unaffected glomeruli. Foci of mononuclear cell infiltration were prominent in the cortex and medulla, particularly in chronic nephritis. Cytoplasmic IBV immunofluorescence was found in all segments of the tubules, but not in the glomeruli. There was no evidence of virus replication in the caecal tonsil and bursa of Fabricius. Evidence of extensive coronavirus replication was found in the cells of the tubules. A large number of viral inclusion bodies as seen containing dark smooth particles 120 nm in diameter within a single membrane. Virus was readily recovered from the kidneys as well as faeces of birds with acute and chronic nephritis. It is concluded that direct virus-induced cell lysis is the primary cause of IBV nephritis. In addition, about 50 per cent of the chronically infected birds also developed brush-border auto-antibody.",1
"Ten young dogs were experimentally infected twice with different isolates of bovine rotavirus and 2 uninfected dogs were kept in contact with them. None of the animals developed diarrhoea, but all of them excreted rotavirus in their faeces over a period of up to 10 days after each inoculation, as shown by counterimmunoelectro-osmophoresis and virus isolation. Dogs may thus play a role in the epizootiology of rotavirus diarrhoea in calves. Seroconversion occurred in 6 of the 10 infected dogs but in neither of the 2 contact controls.",1
"The ultrastructure of the proximal tubular epithelial cells in chicken kidneys was examined throughout the course of an experimental infection with infectious bronchitis virus. A quantitative assessment of the structural changes in the cells was related to these in normal cells. Significant alterations were detected in the membrane structures and in the mitochondria. There was a reduction in surface area of the microvillus membrane, the basolateral membrane and the apical tubular membrane. There were alterations in the shape of mitochondrial profiles and a decrease in the volume density of mitochondria. Vesicular structures, which are a possible site of viral release, were observed in the lateral surface of cells. These changes in the functional components of the cells indicate impaired transport of ions and water. The results demonstrate the value of stereological methods for the study of viral-host cell interactions in the pathogenesis of viral disease.",1
The relation of myofibrillar hypoplasia to clinical splayleg was studied. A strain of Belgian Landrace sows was selected for this study because they produced pigs which had no myfibrillar hypoplasia. Myofibrillar hypoplasia could nevertheless by induced experimentally in these animals by dexamethasone treatment of the sows during late pregnancy. The lesion was observed without clinical signs and was compared to the myofibrillar hypoplasia in clinical cases of splayleg. The differences between these 2 groups may account for the appearance of clinical signs. These differences included the maturity of the myofibrils and the degree of autophagosomal glycogen breakdown.,1
"Peripheral blood lymphocytes, intraepithelial lymphocytes from the small intestine and lymphocytes from the thymus, spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes and Peyer's patches from 5 young adult pigs were used as effector cells in a spontaneous cell-mediated cytotoxicity chromium release assay against PK-15 cells persistently infected with transmissible gastroenteritis virus as targets. Both peripheral blood and intraepithelial lymphocytes caused marked specific chromium release, while the lymphocytes from the remaining tissues were inactive in spontaneous cell-mediated cytotoxicity.",1
"Three-day-old suckling mice inoculated intracerebrally (i.c.) with the 67N strain of haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV) showed nervous signs and died. The virus was passaged 10 times in suckling mice and was designated the MB-67N strain. The pathogenesis of MB-67N was studied with various ages of mice and inoculation routes. All mice inoculated i.c. with a large dose of virus died regardless of age, although a smaller dose caused fatal infection only in suckling mice. By intranasal, intraperitoneal and subcutaneous inoculation, the virus also killed suckling mice under 16 days old, but not older mice, even with a large dose. The susceptibility of mice for the MB-67N strain was influenced by age and inoculation routes. High titres of virus were re-isolated from the brain of diseased mice after inoculation by any route, but not from other organs. Histologically, numerous areas of severe tocal necrosis were produced in the cerebral cortex. Specific immuno-fluorescence and numerous viral particles were found in the cytoplasm of nerve cells by immuno-fluorescence staining and electron microscopy. These findings indicate that the MB-67N propagates mainly in the central nervous system and nerve cells serve as a main target of virus replication.",1
"Haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV) was inoculated either orally or intranasally into ten 3-day-old gnotobiotic piglets. All infected pigs showed inappetence and listlessness, but there were no clinical signs of nervous disorder. Severe encephalomyelitis, characterized by neuronophagia, focal gliosis and perivascular cuffing, was observed in the brain stem and cerebral cortex. Nasally infected pigs, in particular, developed lesions in the area of the stria olfactoria and tractus olfactorius. Coincident with the encephalitic changes, HEV antigen was observed first in the trigeminal ganglion cells and then in degenerating neurones. Immunoglobulin (IgG and IgM)-containing cells were also found in perivascular cuffs and glial foci. They appeared at first on PID 7 and after that increased in number. These findings suggest that these encephalitic lesions are a specific immune response to HEV following its multiplication in the central nervous system.",1
"A spontaneous neurological disease in cats characterized by behavioural and motor disturbances was investigated by clinical, morphological and immunological methods. Neuropathological examination showed a marked inflammatory reaction in the cerebral leptomeninges and the grey matter of the brain. In the white matter, the reaction was moderate. The changes consisted of perivascular cuffing by mononuclear cells and neuronal damage. The brain stem (thalamus, mesencephalon, caudal colliculus) was most severely affected. The spinal cord and its leptomeninges were involved to a lesser degree. The histopathological picture as well as the laboratory findings suggests a viral cause of the disease. The morphology of the disease and serological as well as immunohistochemical results indicate that this disorder is different from previously known feline viral encephalitides.",1
"The potential involvement of the pharyngeal tonsil in the pathogenesis of bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1) infection was examined in neonatal and weanling calves infected by intranasal aerosol. Calves were monitored from days 1 to 5, and on day 6 (neonates) or 8 (weanlings) and, in a second trial at day 4·5, by histology, electron microscopy, immunocytochemistry and virus isolation. Mucosal lesions of neonates were similar to, but less extensive than, those of weanling calves. Loss of microvilli and goblet cells, with minimal epithelial erosions as early as day 1, progressed to necrosis of epithelium and adjacent lymphoid tissue, and leucocyte exudation. Lesions and clinical disease were progressive up to and including day 6 in neonates, but resolving in weanlings on days 5 and 8. By transmission electron microscopy, the physical characteristics of the phagocytic cells appeared similar in both age groups, and viral replication was not identified in leucocytes. Virus was isolated from, or found by immunocytochemistry in, the pharyngeal tonsil of all calves examined, except for two weanlings on days 1 and 8. Virus as detected by immunocytochemistry was restricted to epithelium and superficial lymphoid tissue in neonates, but was found in deep lymphoid tissue around germinal centres in weanlings. The study showed that the pharyngeal tonsil is readily infected with BHV-1 and may be an important lymphoid tissue for early anti-viral responses. The delayed inflammatory response and reduced viral clearance may contribute to the increased susceptibility of neonatal calves to fatal BHV-1 infections.",1
"We compared the pathogenicity and the sites of multiplication of the attenuated Nouzilly strain, with the highly passaged Purdue-115 and the virulent Gep II strains of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) coronavirus, in 1-week-old weaned piglets. The immunohistochemical peroxidase technique, with an antiviral nucleoprotein monoclonal antibody, was used for the localization of the multiplication sites, in the intestine and other organs. The Gep II and the Purdue-115 strains, administered orally to piglets, caused clinical signs and lesions of TGE. These strains multiplied within the intestinal tract in the enterocytes of the jejunum and ileum, Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes. In view of the small numbers of infected cells in the tonsils, spleen, kidney, liver and lung, these tissues are not considered to be preferential multiplication sites. The attenuated Nouzilly strain multiplies only in the ileum and the mesenteric lymph nodes. The variation in the tropism for particular parts of the intestine (with the preferential localization of the virus in the ileum rather than the jejunum), could be related to the high degree of attenuation of the Nouzilly strain.",1
Autoradiographic methods can be used as an alternative to indirect immunofluorescence to detect viral antigen expression or the presence of IgG in tissue sections. Iodinated protein A isolated from Staphylococcus aureus detects an influx of IgG into the central nervous system of mice inoculated with the coronavirus SD. Antispecies antibody that has been iodinated detects coronavirus antigen expression for 24 days post-inoculation while it is only detectable for 10 days by immunofluorescence. A direct comparison of indirect fluorescence and autoradiographic methods indicates that the autoradiographic techniques are considerably more sensitive. This increased sensitivity is sufficient to permit the detection of viral antigen in formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections.,1
"The sensitivity of the hemolysis-in-gel (HIG) test with rubella antigen is not improved by chemical linkage of the virus to the erythrocytes, and after such modification, IgM specific antibodies are not detectable. In the influenza HIG test with tetraazotized o-dianisidine (TOD), chromic chloride and potassium periodate as coupling reagents, increased sensitivity was observed with allantoic fluid of infected eggs as antigen. If Tween-ether treated hemagglutinin is used in the HIG test, zones of hemolysis are detectable only after treatment of the erythrocytes with TOD, chromic chloride and potassium periodate.",1
"Monoclonal antibodies (MCA) against bovine immunoglobulin (BIg) isotypes were produced and characterized. MCAs were obtained which react specifically with IgG, IgG1, IgG2 or IgA while MCAs against IgM showed a partial cross-reaction with affinity purified IgA. MCAs with optimal characteristics for application in ELISA were selected and used as conjugates in an indirect double antibody sandwich assay (IDAS) and as the capturing antibody in an antibody capture assay (ACA) for the isotype-specific detection of antibodies against rotavirus. Based on theoretical grounds, experimental analysis of inter- and intra-isotype competition in IDAS and ACA, respectively, and direct comparison of both tests, the IDAS was selected for the detection of IgG1 and IgG2 anti-rotavirus antibodies. The ACA was the test of choice for the detection of IgM and IgA anti-rotavirus antibodies. The isotype specificity of these tests relies on the specificity of the MCAs and was confirmed for each test by the observation that samples containing rotavirus antibodies of only 1 particular isotypee reacted only in the homologous assay. The MCAs against bovine Ig isotypes and isotype-specific ELISAs were found to be very useful in the study of humoral mucosal immunity in calves infected with rotavirus.",1
"Viral proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred quantitatively to nitrocellulose by electroblotting in SDS-containing buffer. Monoclonal antibodies directed against previously defined epitopes on the viral proteins were used as probes to detect viral protein synthesis and processing, as well as expression in animal tissues. Circulating polyclonal antibodies were also probed and characterized for their polypeptide specificities. Under appropriate conditions, this Western immunoblotting technique was quantitative. Finally, a highly sensitive dot immunoblotting assay was used to analyze the sensitivity to denaturation of various epitopes on the viral proteins. This assay detected picogram quantities of viral antigens and antibodies.",1
"A new, simple enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is described which is performed directly on infected and fixed cell cultures in microtitre plates. It permits large scale screening of antiviral monoclonal antibodies and differentiation of specific antibodies from those usually responsible for high background reactions in other ELISA techniques. Time consuming purification of antigens is thus avoided. The plaque/focus immunoassay is also applicable to titration of antibodies in patients' sera and antigens in lytically or non-lytically virus-infected cells. It may also be used to localize antigens in different cell compartments. This immunoassay requires no special equipment and results may be evaluated either with the naked eye or using a light microscope.",1
"The preparation of a new soluble immune complex conjugate (anti-IgA-IgA-peroxidase), suitable for use in the ELISA technique is described. This conjugate requires pure IgA and specific anti-IgA, but the enzyme (peroxidase) was easily conjugated to the IgA.",1
"We have investigated an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for mouse IgG using affinity-purified goat anti-mouse antibodies for capture and detection. This assay was used to measure the absolute or weight/volume concentration of murine monoclonal antibody in hybridoma supernatants. Bovine or horse serum did not interfere with the assay, which permitted reliable measurement of all murine IgG subclasses except IgG3 in the 1–20 ng/ml range. Antibody capture was essentially complete in the optimized assay. In combination with an antigen-dependent ELISA, the assay allowed estimation of the absolute concentration of specific monoclonal antibody in ascites. These rapid and relatively simple assays may be applicable in many situations in which a practical means of measuring murine monoclonal antibodies in weight/volume units is needed.",1
"BALB/c male mice were mated with either Swiss-Webster or MF1 females to produce first generation cross-bred offspring. Hybridoma cell lines, from the fusion of P3-NS1-Ag4/1 myeloma cells with spleen cells sensitised to the porcine coronavirus causing transmissible gastroenteritis, were injected intraperitoneally into these mice to produce ascitic fluid containing monoclonal antibodies. Mice of 11 weeks of age weighing between 26 and 34 g were used. The volume of ascites produced by mice injected with four of the five hybrid cell lines tested was greater in the cross-bred offspring than in the BALB/c parent. The fifth cell line gave comparable volumes in the MF1 cross-breed and BALB/c parent but a lesser volume in the Swiss-Webster cross-breed. The antibody titres of the ascites as determined by virus neutralisation, radioimmune and indirect immune fluorescence assays, did not differ significantly between mouse types. The ability to use all offspring from a litter of cross-bred mice, irrespective of sex, and the increased volume of ascitic fluid formed in each mouse, permits fewer animals to be used for the production of ascites in these strains, thereby offering considerable economic and ethical advantages over the use of BALB/c mice.",1
"The B lymphocytes of the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus can be immortalised by infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in vitro (Desranges et al., 1976). C. jacchus is susceptible to infection with the blood stages of several species of malaria parasite including the line designated MVF1 (Mitchell et al., 1988) from which it recovers and shows immunity to reinfection. By exploiting these two phenomena, EBV-transformed, marmoset lymphoblastoid cell lines secreting antibodies to malaria parasite antigens have been generated and cloned. We believe this to be the first time that monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been raised from common marmosets. Since numerous and diverse human pathogens can infect this small primate in the laboratory, these methods may prove generally applicable for the generation of MAbs whose specificities derive from immune responses to infection.",1
"A method is described for in vitro studies of viral humoral immune responses in the pig. After oral immunization with transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) coronavirus, antibody production from primed mesenteric lymph node cells was revealed by an in vitro boost with viral antigen. For the latter the leukocytes were co-cultured with UV-inactivated virus using a variety of different methods of antigenic stimulation. Enumeration of specific antibody-secreting cells (ASC) and titration of secreted anti-virus antibodies were performed with ELISASPOT (using 3-amino 9-ethyl carbazole as the peroxidase chromogen) and ELISA tests respectively, according to the Ig isotype. The results showed a close relationship between ASC numbers and secreted antibody titres. The best in vitro antibody synthesis was observed when the sensitized cells were maintained in contact with virus during the whole culture period. Antibody responses were defined by a kinetic profile characterized by a narrow peak, with a maximum occuring after 4 and 6 days of culture and with the IgA response appearing earlier than the IgG. This methodology, which analyses specific antibody responses at the cellular level, may permit studies on the mechanisms of Ig isotype regulation. Extended to leukocytes from other organs of the immune system, it may also constitute an in vitro model to study antibody responses expressed in different lymphoid tissues of the pig.",1
"Previously, fusion of established T cell lines or clones has been claimed to be difficult. We now report our experiences in the fusion of both long term cultures of rat T cell clones and mouse T cell lines to rat W/Fu (C58NT)D. Upon fusion of rat T cell clones the hybrids obtained expressed antigen specificities identical to those of the parent clones. In addition, C58 was used for interspecies hybridisation of murine T cell lines. The specificity of intra- and inter-species hybrids was maintained by subcloning. We conclude that the C58 cell line can be used to generate continuously growing monoclonal T-cell reagents of sufficient stability using both intra- and inter-species hybri disation.",1
"We describe the use of random peptide sequences for the mapping of antigenic determinants. An oligonucleotide with a completely degenerate sequence of 17 or 23 nucleotides was inserted into a bacterial expression vector. This resulted in an expression library producing random hexa- or octapeptides attached to a β-galactosidase hybrid protein. Mimotopes, or antigenic sequences that mimic an epitope, were selected by immunoscreening of colonies with monoclonal antibodies, which were specific for antigenic sites on the spike protein of the coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus. We report one mimotope for antigenic site II, eight for site III and one for site IV. The site III and site IV mimotopes were closely similar to the corresponding linear epitopes, localized previously in the amino acid sequence of the S protein. An alignment of the site II mimotope and the sequence of the S protein around Trp97, which is substituted in escape mutants, suggests that this mimotope mimics a conformational epitope located around residues 97–103. Applications of mimotopes to epitope mapping, serodiagnosis and vaccine development are discussed.",1
"The effect of various fixatives and detergents on the in vitro detection of the viral determinants which are expressed in swine testis cells infected with the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) was studied using a microwell immunoperoxidase technique. When compared with glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde, 0.1% paraformaldehyde was found to be the fixative of choice for the detection of these determinants on the membranes of infected cells. Among dehydrating fixatives, 80% acetone or a mixture of acetone and ethanol or of acetone, methanol and ethanol were found to be the best fixatives for the detection of these viral determinants which are expressed in infected cells. In the case of acetone, the temperature of fixation and its concentration in the fixative preparation were found to be important. The treatment of 0.05% glutaraldehyde-fixed, infected cells with 0.1% saponin or 0.1% paraformaldehyde-fixed, infected cells with 1%NP-40 led to satisfactory detection of viral determinants. Using Triton X-100 to render cells permeable, the quantities of N and M antigen detected in TGEV-infected cells prefixed with either 0.05% glutaraldehyde or 0.1% paraformaldehyde were equal to those of 80% acetone-fixed, TGEV-infected cells while the quantity of S antigen detected was diminished. The effect of other detergents such as zwittergent, embigen BB, Chaps and N-lauroylsarcosine on the detection of viral determinants was also studied.",1
"CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) constitute a major portion of immune responses to foreign and self antigens. CTL recognize class I major histocompatibility complex molecules complexed to peptides of 8–10 residues derived from cytosolic proteins. To understand CTL responses to these antigens to manipulate CTL responses optimally, it is necessary to identify the specific peptides recognized by CTL. The methods currently used for this purpose have significant drawbacks. We describe a plasmid transfection method that results in significant lysis of histocompatible target cells. Influenza virus-specific CTLs specifically lysed target cells that were transfected with plasmids bearing cDNAs encoding full length gene products, fragments containing the region that encodes the CTL epitope, or even a ten residue peptide. This significantly lessens the time and effort required todefine genes, and gene segments that contain CTL epitopes.",1
Methods to check the antiviral activities of mononuclear phagocytes or macrophages are described. Two types of antiviral activities are defined. The intrinsic antiviral activity is determined as the outcome of virus replication in the macrophage per se whereas the extrinsic antiviral activity refers to the ability to reduce virus production in other surrounding cells that are normally permissive. The interpretation of the data are discussed.,1
"As interest in the development of oral vaccines continues to rise, alternative animal models for studies of mucosal immunity are needed. The present study examines a simplified procedure for delivering antigen to rabbit Peyer's patches via an indwelling cannula. The cannula was placed 3–4 cm proximal to the Peyer's patch, and was used to deliver four weekly doses of the potent mucosal immunogen, cholera toxin (CT). Anti-CT specific fecal secretory IgA (S-IgA), serum IgG and serum IgA were found in essentially equal amounts in rabbits with cannulas and in rabbits fitted with Thiry-Vella (T-V) isolated ileal loops. In contrast to animals with T-V loops, the intestinal flora of animals with cannulas contained less bacterial overgrowth with Pseudomonas sp. Further, the villus architecture remained histologically normal in appearance and there were fewer post-surgical complications associated with this technique than with T-V loops. This simplified technique should allow wider use of rabbits in studies of mucosal immunity.",1
"The replication cycle of the granulosis virus of Cydia pomonella, the codling moth, was studied at the cellular and tissue level. Membranelike complexes were observed forming within the remnants of the nucleolus in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Differences in cell polarity relative to the sites of virus entry assembly and budding as well as differences in the temporal aspects of replication were observed between midgut, fat body, and epidermal cells. The progressive spread of virus throughout larval tissues was studied at 24, 32, 48, 56, and 72 hr postinfection. The basal lamina seemed to be an effective barrier for the release of budded progeny virus into the hemocoel and large numbers of budded virus were produced.",1
"The carbohydrate contents of coronavirus glycoproteins E1 and E2 have been analyzed. E2 has complex and mannose-rich-type oligosaccharide side-chains, which are attached by N-glycosidic linkages to the polypeptide. Glycosylation of E2 is initiated at the co-translational level, and it is inhibited by tunicamycin, 2-deoxy-glucose, and 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-glucose. Thus, E2 belongs to a glycoprotein type found in many other enveloped viruses. E1, in contrast, represents a different class of glycoprotein. The following observations indicate that its carbohydrate side-chains have 0-glycosidic linkage. (1) The constituent sugars of E1 are N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose, and neuraminic acid; mannose and fucose are absent. (2) The side-chains can be removed by β-elimination. (3) Glycosylation of E1 is not sensitive to the compounds interfering with N-glycosylation. E1 is the first viral glycoprotein analyzed that contains only 0-glycosidic linkages. Coronaviruses are therefore a suitable model system to study biosynthesis and processing of this type of glycoprotein.",1
"The black beetle virus (BBV) is an isometric insect virus whose genome consists of two messenger-active RNA molecules encapsidated in a single virion. The nucleotide sequence of BBV RNA1 (3105 bases) has been determined, and this, together with the sequence of BBV RNA2 (1399 bases) provides the complete primary structure of the BBV genome. The RNA1 sequence encompasses a 5′ non-coding region of 38 nucleotides, a coding region for a protein of predicted molecular weight 101,873 (protein A, implicated in viral RNA synthesis) and a 3′ proximal region encoding RNA3 (389 bases), a subgenomic messenger RNA made in infected cells but not encapsidated into virions. The RNA3 sequence starts 16 bases inside the coding region of protein A and contains two overlapping open reading frames for proteins of molecular weight 10,760 and 11,633, one of which is believed to be protein B, made in BBV-infected cells. A limited homology exists between the sequences of RNA1 and RNA2. Sequence regions have been identified that provide energetically favorable bonding between RNA2 and RNA1 possibly to facilitate their common encapsidation, and between RNA2 and negative strand RNA1 possibly to regulate the production of RNA3.",1
"The amino acid sequences of the spike proteins from three distantly related coronaviruses have been deduced from cDNA sequences. In the C-terminal half, an homology of about 30% was found, while there was no detectable sequence conservation in the N-terminal regions. Hydrophobic “heptad” repeat patterns indicated the presence of two α-helices with predicted lengths of 100 and 50 Å, respectively. It is suggested that, in the spike oligomer. these α-helices form a complex coiled-coil, resembling the supersecondary structures in two other elongated membrane proteins, the haemagglutinin of influenza virus and the variable surface glycoprotein of trypanosomes.",1
"The structure of the 5′ GCGAUUUCUGACCGCUUUUUUGUCAG 3′ RNA oligonucleotide was investigated using biochemical and chemical probes and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Formation of a pseudoknot is indicated by the imino proton spectrum. Imino protons are observed consistent with formation of two helical stem regions; nuclear Overhauser enhancements between imino protons show that the two stem regions stack to form a continuous helix. In the stem regions, nucleotide conformations (3′-endo, anti) and internucleotide distances, derived from two-dimensional correlated, spectroscopy and two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectra, are characteristic of A-form geometry. The data suggest minor distortion in helical stacking at the junctions of stems and loops. The model of the pseudoknot is consistent with the structure originally proposed by Pleij et al.",1
"Protein sequence alignments have become an important tool for molecular biologists. Local alignments are frequently constructed with the aid of a “substitution score matrix” that specifies a score for aligning each pair of amino acid residues. Over the years, many different substitution matrices have been proposed, based on a wide variety of rationales. Statistical results, however, demonstrate that any such matrix is implicitly a “log-odds” matrix, with a specific target distribution for aligned pairs of amino acid residues. In the light of information theory, it is possible to express the scores of a substitution matrix in bits and to see that different matrices are better adapted to different purposes. The most widely used matrix for protein sequence comparison has been the PAM-250 matrix. It is argued that for database searches the PAM-120 matrix generally is more appropriate, while for comparing two specific proteins with suspected homology the PAM-200 matrix is indicated. Examples discussed include the lipocalins, human α 1B-glycoprotein, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and the globins.",1
"The genomic RNA of the coronavirus IBV contains an efficient ribosomal frameshift signal at the junction of the overlapping 1a and 1b open reading frames. The signal is comprised of two elements, a heptanucleotide “slip-site” and a downstream tertiary RNA structure in the form of an RNA pseudoknot. We have investigated the structure of the pseudoknot and its contribution to the frameshift process by analysing the frameshifting properties of a series of pseudoknot mutants. Our results show that the pseudoknot structure closely resembles that which can be predicted from current building rules, although base-pair formation at the region where the two pseudoknot stems are thought to stack co-axially is not a pre-requisite for efficient frameshifting. The stems, however, must be in close proximity to generate a functional structure. In general, the removal of a single base-pair contact in either stem is sufficient to reduce or abolish frameshifting. No primary sequence determinants in the stems or loops appear to be involved in the frameshift process; as long as the overall structure is maintained, frameshifting is highly efficient. Thus, small insertions into the pseudoknot loops and a deletion in loop 2 that reduced its length to the predicted functional minimum did not influence frameshifting. However, a large insertion (467 nucleotides) into loop 2 abolished frameshifting. A simple stem-loop structure with a base-paired stem of the same length and nucleotide composition as the stacked stems of the pseudoknot could not functionally replace the pseudoknot, suggesting that some particular conformational feature of the pseudoknot determines its ability to promote frameshifting.",1
"Crystals of the two ammo-terminal domains of intercellular adhesion molecule-1, the receptor for the major group of human rhinovirus serotypes, diffract to 3.0 Å resolution. The crystals are trigonal in space group P3121 or P3221 with cell dimensions of a = b = 55.7 A ̊ , c = 166.3 A ̊ , with probably six molecules per unit cell.",1
"The ribosomal frameshift signal in the genomic RNA of the coronavirus IBV is composed of two elements, a heptanucleotide “slippery-sequence” and a downstream RNA pseudoknot. We have investigated the kinds of slippery sequence that can function at the IBV frameshift site by analysing the frameshifting properties of a series of slippery-sequence mutants. We firstly confirmed that the site of frameshifting in IBV was at the heptanucleotide stretch UUUAAAC, and then used our knowledge of the pseudoknot structure and a suitable reporter gene to prepare an expression construct that allowed both the magnitude and direction of ribosomal frameshifting to be determined for candidate slippery sequences. Our results show that in almost all of the sequences tested, frameshifting is strictly into the −1 reading frame. Monotonous runs of nucleotides, however, gave detectable levels of a −2 +1 frameshift product, and U stretches in particular gave significant levels (2% to 21%). Preliminary evidence suggests that the RNA pseudoknot may play a role in influencing frameshift direction. The spectrum of slip-sequences tested in this analysis included all those known or suspected to be utilized in vivo. Our results indicate that triplets of A, C, G and U are functional when decoded in the ribosomal P-site following slippage ( XXX YYYN) although C triplets were the least effective. In the A-site (XXY YYY N), triplets of C and G were non-functional. The identity of the nucleotide at position 7 of the slippery sequence (XXXYYY N ) was found to be a critical determinant of frameshift efficiency and we show that a hierarchy of frameshifting exists for A-site codons. These observations lead us to suggest that ribosomal frameshifting at a particular site is determined, at least in part, by the strength of the interaction of normal cellular tRNAs with the A-site codon and does not necessarily involve specialized “shifty” tRNAs.",1
"Doughnut-shaped particles, 55–65 nm in diameter, were revealed by electron microscopy in the cisterns of the rough endoplasmic reticulum of cells from an active lesion in autopsied brain tissue from a multiple sclerosis patient. The morphology of the particles closely resembled that of coronaviruses.",1
"The DA virus is a neurotropic murine virus which can induce acute encephalomyelitis in suckling mice and a chronic myelopathy in weanlings. The agent has been attenuated by serial passage in baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells. When attenuated virus is inoculated in 8-week-old C3HeJ mice a myelopathy of delayed onset with prominent demyelination of lateral and anterior columns occurs. The DA virus is believed to be related to the Theiler murine encephalomyelitis (TME) viruses because of the similar clinical and pathological conditions which it causes, and because neutralization tests indicate shared antigens between it and GD7, a TME virus. This paper reports electron-microscopic studies of BHK-21 cells infected with DA virus. The cells were prepared 24 and 48 hr after inoculation. Cytopathic effects were observed and infected cells contained plaques consisting of numerous 25 nm virus particles in crystalline array. The virions were exclusively intracytoplasmic and were morphologically indistinguishable from human poliomyelitis virus. These observations appear to establish DA as a picorna virus, related to the TME virus group. The chronic myelopathy caused by DA may prove relevant to chronic demyelinative myelopathies in man, such as multiple sclerosis, and also to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",1
"The anterior funiculus of the spinal cervical cord of post-natal rats was examined ultrastructurally. The myelinating cells found one day after birth contained a large amount of evenly distributed ribosomes up to the outer tongue of mesaxons, representing the cytoplasmic density. These cells were separated by astrocytic processes from the pial basement membrane, even when they were located on the pial surface. Astrocytes contained glial fibrils from one day onwards and often attached their processes to the pial basement membrane. Although the cytoplasmic processes of astrocytes occasionally wrapped axons, they were never shown to form the initial layer of myelin sheaths. However, the tenuous processes of the sub-pial astrocytes were occasionally rolled in myelin lamellae, as if a part of the myelin sheaths was constructed by astrocytic processes. The interpretation for this finding is discussed in relation to function and potency of the astrocytes, and variations and anomalies of nervous ontogeny.",1
"The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine levels of specific IgG antibodies against measles, rubella, vaccinia, corona (OC43) and mumps viruses in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum of 18 patients with clinically definite multiple sclerosis (MS), 8 patients with optic neuritis (ON), 27 patients with other neurological disease (OND), and 88 control subjects without central nervous system disease. Serum antibody levels were not significantly different between the four groups. Differences in the frequency and levels of CSF antibodies between the four groups were observed. Control patients had serum CSF antibody ratios from 2.0 to 3.0 (log) with an average of 2.5 corresponding to a 320-fold difference between serum and CSF antibody levels. MS patients had ratios from 1.1 to 2.1 with an average of 1.6. The average was 2.0 for the ON patients. The average for the OND patients was similar to the controls. The altered serum CSF ratios for several viruses within an individual patient was similar. These results suggest that nonspecific immunostimulation is responsible for the increased levels of CSF virus antibodies.",1
"Oligodendrocytes isolated from 4–6-week-old rat brains were transplanted into newborn shiverer brains. Cells were identified as mature oligodendrocytes both by immunocytological and ultrastructural criteria. Normal myelin was detected using immunolocalisation (with an anti-MBP antiserum) and electron microscopy (presence of the major dense line). Patches of normal myelin (made by transplanted oligodendrocytes), widely spread throughout the host brains, were detected between 20 and 130 days after grafting. No sign of acute rejection was observed, but the graft became progressively delimited by astrocytic processes forming a continuous basal lamina.",1
"Previous studies have shown that mice can be protected from a lethal infection with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) by the adoptive transfer of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH)-inducer T cell clones specific for the virus. Protection does not involve the suppression of virus replication in the central nervous system (CNS) or via augmentation of the antiviral antibody response. In the present report we have compared the CNS lesions induced by JHMV in lethally infected and T cell clone protected mice. The presence of virus-specific T cell clones induced a transient increase in mononuclear cell infiltration into the parenchyma of the brains of protected mice, consistent with previous data suggesting that a DTH response was responsible for protection. Immunohistochemical studies suggested further that virus was not replicating in the ependyma or cellular infiltrate, but that the presence of the T cell clone prevented neuronal infection. While the mechanism of effectively altering the in vivo cellular tropism is unknown, survival is accompanied by increased specific destruction of target tissues with fulminant CNS demyelination and an increased incidence of persistent infection.",1
"An increase in fast axonal transport of protein by the optic nerve was found in mice following a single combined injection of human recombinant tumour necrosis factor alpha (rTNF) and [3H]proline into the vitreous chamber. Demyelination was observed in optic nerve fibres arising from the eyes of mice which received a single rTNF injection. No such changes were detected when heat-inactivated rTNF was injected with the label. The effects of intravitreal injection of rTNF on the pathophysiology of mouse optic nerve resembled those found in mice infected with Semliki Forest virus (SFV), an animal model of multiple sclerosis. We suggest that TNF could mediate at lease some of the pathophysiological changes found in SFV-infected mice and may provide a clue concerning the disease mechanism in multiple sclerosis.",1
"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is acquired as a systemic “trait” by individuals who are genetically susceptible. This condition does not involve the central nervous system (CNS) and is characterized by a state of hyperactive immunocompetent responsiveness. It develops as the result of an antigenic challenge by a viral protein, either from a viral infection or a vaccination. In order for MS to become a disease affecting the CNS, it is necessary for the blood-brain barrier's (BBB) impermeability to be altered. This is now a fully recognized fact. As a result of this change, the MS lesion, which consists of edema and inflammation occurs. It may but need not lead to demyelination. Several mechanisms can cause this increased permeability of the BBB. The role of the immune system, and in particular of T lymphocytes in initiating and continuing the process of lesion formation remains extremely controversial. In fact, there are unanswered questions regarding the actual target of MS: is it the myelin sheath itself or its forming cell, the oligodendrocyte, or is it the BBB itself leading to bystander demyelination? The role of mild, concussional trauma to the CNS in producing the alteration of the BBB and therefore acting as a trigger or facilitator in the development or enlargement of MS lesions in the CNS, is based on considerable clinical, neuropathological and experimental evidence. Along with another viral infection, it must be one of the commonest causes of progression of MS, and quite often leads to the onset of the clinical manifestations of an hitherto asymptomatic condition.",1
"The somatic cell hybridization technique for gene mapping depends on assembling panels of rodent-human hybrid clones containing random subsets of the human chromosomes. Such panels should be as informative as possible and permit error detection and error correction for assays of the human gene in the various clones. We derive estimates of the number of randomly generated clones required to be reasonably confident of accurately and unambiguously assigning a gene to a particular human chromosome. The collection of clones in such a random panel is contrasted with minimal panels suggested by algebraic coding theory. To approximate minimal panels we suggest the method of simulated annealing for selecting small, informative panels from larger existing collections of clones. These theoretical insights emphasize the need for more collaboration and coordination among gene mapping groups so that optimal clone panels can be assembled, stored, and distributed.",1
"Recombination is an important aspect of DNA metabolism. It leads to rearrangements of DNA sequences within genomes. Such genome rearrangements seem to be ubiquitous, since they play a role in evolution, human health and biotechnology. In medicine one important aspect of recombination is its role as one possible step in the multistep process of carcinogenesis. Since recombination may occur as a cellular response to DNA damage, the protection of cells from recombination-inducing agents, so-called recombinagen, should eliminate possible deleterious effects resulting from damage-induced DNA recombination. During the last few years, the awareness of the importance of recombination phenomena has substantially increased and the development of assay systems detecting recombinagens has progressed. The need for considering recombinagenic effects as a safety aspect of chemicals has gained ground in the field of genetic toxicology. This paper summarizes present knowledge concerning the occurence, inducibility, detection and toxicological interpretation of DNA recombination.",1
"This study examined the effects and aftereffects of naturally occurring upper respiratory tract illnesses on mood and performance. Twenty-six subjects (12 males, 14 females, mean age 23 years 10 months, age range 18–39 years) were tested once a week for a period of a month. Fifteen subjects were suffering from a common cold on the first week and the other 11 subjects were matched healthy controls. Subjects attended for an initial 3-h testing period that consisted of a set of practice trials and two test sessions involving mood rating and performance of a battery of tests measuring psychomotor functions, attention, and memory. Sessions 3, 4, and 5 took place 1, 2, and 3 weeks later, respectively. In addition to measuring mood and mental performance, symptom severity was rated on a subjective checklist. The results showed that subjects with a cold reported an increase in negative mood and that this was only significant in the first week. Impairments of psychomotor function (simple reaction time and tracking) were also observed at this time. Performance of sustained and selective attention tasks was also impaired in subjects with colds but this effect was only significant in the second week. Other functions such as working and semantic memory were unimpaired in subjects with colds at any point in the experiment. Overall, the present results confirm many of the earlier results obtained in studies of experimentally induced upper respiratory tract illnesses. Indeed, these results are both of great practical importance and theoretical interest and further studies must now elucidate the mechanisms underlying these effects.",1
"The present study was performed to investigate the effects of centrally administered oxytocin on weight gain and food intake in rats. Two substrains of Sprague-Dawley rats (A and B) differing in average daily weight gain were used. Female rats of substrain A gained 2 g per day and males gained 7 g. Female rats of substrain B gained 5 g per day and males gained 8 g. Animals were implanted with a stainless steel guide cannula, allowing ICV injections into the lateral ventricle. ICV injections of 1, 5, or 10 μg of oxytocin or isotonic saline in a volume of 5 μl were given. In females, ICV treatment with either saline or 5 μg of oxytocin caused a transient loss of weight within 24 h of treatment. However, in the more slowly growing females of substrain A depression in body weight was observed after a single treatment with saline, whereas the body weight of oxytocin-treated females showed less marked depression and rapidly returned to the pretreatment weight. After a 3-day treatment period an even greater difference in daily weight gain was seen between oxytocin-treated and saline-treated female rats of substrain A. In contrast, no difference in daily weight gain or food intake was observed between oxytocin- and saline-treated male rats of substrain A, nor in females or males of the more rapidly growing substrain B. Intraperitoneal injections of 5 μg of oxytocin did not influence food intake or daily weight gain in female rats of substrain A. These data suggest that oxytocin may act centrally to influence food intake and daily weight gain in slowly growing female Sprague-Dawley rats.",1
"The pathogenesis of canine coronavirus (CCV) infection in 10-week-old puppies was studied up to 14 days after oronasal inoculation. Mild diarrhoea was seen from three to 11 days after inoculation, approximately coincident with faecal virus shedding. Virus was initially isolated from the tonsils on day 3, and then from both small and large intestinal tissues up to 14 days after inoculation. Virus was also isolated from liver and lung. Histological changes were not seen in any tissues, but CCV antigen was detected, using a peroxidase antiperoxidase staining technique, mainly in epithelium overlying gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Virus neutralising antibody was first detected on day 10. Specific anti-CCV IgM was first detected in plasma three days after inoculation and IgG on days 4 to 7. Small amounts of anti-CCV IgG, IgM and IgA were detected in duodenal secretion, but none in bile.",1
"Combinations of porcine respiratory coronavirus (prcv) and either of two swine influenza viruses (H1N1 or H3N2) were administered intranasally and by aerosol to six- to eight-week-old specific pathogen-free pigs. The clinical responses, gross respiratory lesions and growth performances of these pigs were studied and compared with those of single (prcv, H1N1 or H3N2) and mock-infected animals. prcv infection caused fever, growth retardation and lung lesions, but no respiratory symptoms. Infection with swine influenza viruses caused rather similar, mild symptoms of disease, with H1N1 infection being the least severe. Combined infections with influenza viruses and prcv did not appear to enhance the pathogenicity of these viruses. Furthermore, viruses were isolated more frequently from tissues and nasal swabs taken from ‘single’ than ‘dual’ infected animals, suggesting a possible in vivo interference between replication of prcv and swine influenza virus.",1
"Ribavirin, either free in aqueous solution or incorporated into liposomes, was evaluated in 50 specific-pathogen-free kittens after experimental challenge exposure with feline infectious peritonitis virus (fipv). Ribavirin was administered daily for 10 to 14 days at 16·5 mg kg−1 bodyweight given per os, intramuscularly or intravenously beginning 18 hours after kittens were challenge-exposed with fipv. All kittens, including ribavirin-treated and untreated kittens, succumbed to FIP. Clinical signs of disease were more severe in the ribavirin-treated kittens and their mean survival times were shortened. The clinical efficacy of free ribavirin given intravenously at a reduced dosage (5·5 mg kg−1 bodyweight) was compared to that of ribavirin incorporated into lecithin-containing liposomes (5 mg kg−1) intravenously. Drugs were given once daily for three consecutive days of each week for three weeks, beginning 18 hours after virus challenge exposure. There was no significant difference either in survival rate or severity of disease between kittens given free ribavirin, liposomal ribavirin or saline only. Because of its intrinsic toxicity and low therapeutic index against fipv and its marginal antiviral activities in vivo at maximal doses, ribavirin cannot presently be recommended as primary antiviral chemotherapy against fip.",1
"In order to establish the prevalence of viral infections of the bovine fetus in Argentina, a serological survey for antibodies against viral agents currently affecting cattle in this country was conducted. Antibodies against foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1), bovine leukaemia virus (BLV), bovine rotavirus (BRV), bovine coronavirus (BCV), bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) and parainfluenza-3 (PI-3) were investigated in a total of 315 fetal serum samples. Conventional techniques were used: indirect immunofluorescence (FMDV, BHV-1, BVDv and BCV), radial immunodiffusion (BLV), ELISA (BRV) and haemagglutination inhibition (PI-3). Antibodies against BHV-1, BVDV and PI-3 were detected in samples from fetuses in the second and third trimester of gestation, with a prevalence of 1·21 per cent (two of 165), 2·03 per cent (four of 197) and 5·08 per cent (nine of 177), respectively. Either antibodies or non-antibody factors able to bind to BRV and Bcv antigens were detected with a prevalence of 2·44 per cent (five of 205) and 4·54 per cent (five of 110), respectively. In addition, 14·68 per cent of non-specific inhibitors of PI-3 mediated haemagglutination were found. No seropositives against FMDV and BLV were detected.",1
"Four viruses were compared for their ability to induce an intestinal antibody response in piglets. Antibodies were not detected in response to oral vaccination with either fowlpox virus or a baculovirus (BV). Simultaneous oral dosing and parenteral inoculation with high concentrations of BV in an oil emulsion adjuvant induced high levels of circulating virus neutralising (VN) antibodies, and also low levels of intestinal antibodies when booster doses of virus were given. In response to oral vaccination with swinepox virus (SPV), low levels of circulating and intestinal VN antibodies, and higher titres of antibodies reactive in an enzyme immunoassay, including intestinal antibodies of the IgA class, were detected. Oral vaccination with porcine adenovirus type 3 (PAV-3) stimulated both circulating and intestinal VN antibodies, and IgA antibodies were demonstrated in the intestinal contents. It was concluded that SPV and PAV-3 might be suitable vectors for the expression of genes encoding the protective antigens of porcine enteric viruses.",1
"Interferon was induced in two groups of swine lymphocyte antigen (SLA)-defined miniature pigs with polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid complexed with poly-L-lysine and carboxymethylcellulose. The group 1 pigs were low antibody-response phenotypes (SLAa/a, SLAa/c, SLAc/c), and the group 2 pigs were high antibody-response phenotypes (SLAd/d, SLAd/g, SLAg/g). Six hours after induction the antiviral titres were not influenced by the SLA group, but higher titres were observed in females. Higher antiviral titres were found in group 2 pigs before treatment and 24 hours after treatment, and higher titres were found in female pigs. The antiviral titres before and after treatment were also influenced by the sire. Group 2 pigs had lower total leucocyte counts before treatment, and there was a significant reduction in leucocyte numbers in both groups six hours after induction, due mainly to a large reduction in lymphocyte counts.",1
"There is a strong association between failure to thrive and diarrhoeal disease in young Gambian children. The high prevalence of diarrhoeal disease seen is not due to frequent attacks of “acute infantile diarrhoea” of viral origin. The picture of protracted diarrhoea is almost certainly due to colonization of the upper bowel and the high prevalence demonstrated to be at least partly due to the environment to which the children are exposed, particularly in terms of food and water hygiene. Until this cycle of upper bowel colonization and protracted diarrhoea is broken, a diet-based nutrition programme cannot be expected to function effectively.",1
"Monoclonal antibodies raised against a strain of Leishmania infantum isolated in Greece were produced and tested for their protective effect in an in vivo system (in BALB/C mice). A single monoclonal antibody, IgG2b isotype, can prevent the development of two Leishmania strains in vivo: one of L. major and one of L. mexicana amazonensis. This antibody-mediated protection may be dependent on complement.",1
"Over a period of 2 months, 35 of 69 (51%) cases of juvenile diarrhoea studied in eastern Malaysia were associated with rotavirus excretion; rotavirus associated diarrhoea occurred most commonly in the 6–24 month age group. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) of genome ribonucleic acid showed that only 4 rotavirus electropherotypes could be detected. Of those, 2 predominated and 2 were detected only once each; one of these may have been a reassortaient of the two predominant electropherotypes. Analysis of the clinical features of patients excreting rotavirus subgroup 1 or 2, determined by PAGE, demonstrated that rotavirus subgroup 1 was associated with more hypotonic dehydration and need for intravenous therapy: lethargy was significantly more common among those excreting rotavirus subgroup 2.",1
"Tropical sprue, a primary malabsorption syndrome affecting residents and visitors to several tropical regions, occurs in southern India in endemic and epidemic forms. The stomach, the small intestine and colon are affected and malabsorption results in nutrient deficiency. Enterocyte damage, the primary lesion in southern Indian tropical sprue, is the result of a persistent lesion of the stem cell compartment. This lesion occurs on a background of tropical enteropathy and the available evidence suggests that an immunity conferring agent may be responsible for initiating the damage.",1
"Diarrhoea is the most common manifestation of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in Africa. Numerous parasitic or bacterial agents have been implicated, but a pathogen-specific aetiology has not been found. Enteric viruses (i.e., rotavirus, small round structured viruses, coronavirus, and adenovirus) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or electron microscopy in faecal specimens of 17% of 198 consecutive adult admissions to a general medical ward of an urban hospital in Kinshasa, Zaire. Overall, 57% of patients were seropositive for infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1; of these, 50% were classified as World Health Organization Aids stage IV. The prevalence of enteric viruses in stool specimens did not differ significantly between patients with and without HIV infection, and was not associated with acute or chronic diarrhoea, or constitutional symptoms. However, a trend (P = 0·14) towards greater frequency of virus in stools from patients in the lower 3 quintiles of the CD4/CD8 T cell ratio was seen. This trend approached statistical significance (P = 0·07) with stratification by HIV infection. Although we found no evidence in this population to support a major pathogenic role for these viruses alone in the enteropathy of AIDS, increased viral shedding was weakly associated with immunodeficiency.",1
"Halituna( 1 ), a novel diterpene aldehyde possessing a unique cyclopentadieno[c]pyran ring system, has been isolated from the marine alga Halimeda tuna. The structure of 1 was elucidated by spectroscopic techniques. Halitunal shows antiviral activity against murine coronavirus A59 in-vitro.",1
"Both enantiomers of halitunal (1), a novel diterpene aldehyde having an iridoid carbon framework with a heteroaromatic 10π-system, have been synthesized from (+)-genipin (2).",1
"The suitability of the AIN-76A diet for Fischer-344 rats was investigated. This diet, proposed by the American Institute of Nutrition for use when a purified diet composed of refined ingredients and added vitamins and minerals is required, was tested in Sprague-Dawley rats. Male weanling Fischer-344 rats were fed three different lots of the AIN-76A diet from two suppliers. Increase in body weights and food consumption were compared to animals fed a cereal-based control diet. Animals were sacrificed at various intervals and tissues were taken for histopathological observation. By 8 weeks moderate to marked periportal lipidosis developed in livers of all rats fed the AIN-76A diet. Liver-body weight ratios over the 8-week period were significantly higher in rats fed AIN-76A diets compared to rats fed the control diet. However, growth rates of rats fed the AIN-76A diet were similar to growth rates of controls. Some rats fed the AIN-76A diet developed severe hemorrhagic lesions. The AIN-76A diet in its present form is not suitable for use with male Fischer-344 rats.",1
"Coal liquids have been evaluated in a variety of short-term toxicological assays; however, few studies have been conducted to determine the systemic effects after inhalation exposure to these materials. To extend the data base on potential health effects from coal liquefaction materials, we performed a study with solvent refined coal (SRC)-II heavy distillate (HD). Fischer-344 rats were exposed for 6 hr/day, 5 days/week for 5 or 13 weeks to an aerosol of HD (boiling range, 288 to 454°C) at concentrations of 0.69, 0.14, 0.03, or 0.0 mg/liter of air for the high, middle, low, and control groups, respectively. Survival through 13 weeks of exposure was greater than 90% for all groups; body weights for exposed animals were decreased in a dose-dependent manner. significant increases in liver weights and decreases in thymus and ovary weights were observed for treated animals compared with controls. There were also significant treatment-related decreases in erythrocytes, hemoglobin, volume of packed red blood cells, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and total white blood cells. After 5 weeks of exposure serum cholesterol concentrations increased in a dose-dependent manner for both sexes and serum triglyceride amounts decreased for males but not for females. After 13 weeks of exposure, high-dose animals had significant increases in cholesterol (males only), triglycerides, blood urea nitrogen, and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT; males) and significant decreases in albumin, SGPT (females), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Examination of bone-marrow preparations from exposed animals demonstrated consistent decreases in the degree of cellularity, suggesting that this organ is a target for HD. Microscopic evaluation of organ sections indicated exposure-related changes for nasal mucosa, pulmonary macrophages, thymus, liver, kidney, bone marrow, ovaries, and cecum. Results from this study indicated dose-dependent increases in the severity of the lesions observed, with few effects in the low-exposure group that were attributable to the exposure.",1
"Dimethylamine (DMA) is a highly water soluble gas with many industrial applications. Male F-344 rats were exposed to 175 ppm DMA 6 hr per day for 1, 2, 4, or 9 days or 2 years. Gross changes in nasal structure were recorded, effects of DMA on the mucociliary apparatus were assessed using video analysis, and tissues were evaluated for histopathology. In vitro nasal mucociliary flow patterns, mucus flow rates, and ciliary activity were studied and recorded for video motion analysis. There were distinct and generally consistent differences in the shape of the naso-, maxillo-, and ethmoid turbinates between young and old animals. Acute and chronic DMA exposures resulted in erosion of the anterior margins of the naso- and maxillo-turbinates and fenestration of the adjacent septum. Ciliastasis and mucostasis were observed only on the anteromedial aspect of the maxilloturbinate. In the chronically exposed rats, mucociliary activity was present in areas adjacent to erosions of the turbinates and septum. Abnormal mucus flow patterns, including altered or reversed direction of flow and “whirlpool-like” formation, were observed in all treated rats, but were more severe following chronic exposure. There was a good correlation between the distribution of responses as assessed by histopathology and abnormal mucociliary function at all time points. In conclusion, the mucociliary apparatus continues to function in the nasal passages of rats having localized destruction of nasal epithelium, induced by DMA exposure, and this clearance system responds to alterations of nasal structure by modification of mucus flow patterns.",1
"Adaptation to prolonged ozone (O3) exposure occurs in the tracheal epithelium of rats and is marked by the presence of ciliated cells with uniform short cilia but is not accompanied by shifts in cell populations, altered characteristics of epithelial secretory cell products, increased cell turnover, or elevated tracheal superoxide dismutase activity. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that adaptation is a result of alterations intrinsic to epithelial cells or to the cells and their matrix, and not due to systemic or neural influences. Rats were preexposed to either filtered air (FA) or 0.96 ppm O3 for 8 hr/night for 60 days, and then their tracheae were removed and exposed to 3 ppm O3 in an explant culture system where behavioral, nasal, exudative, and secretory product influences can be eliminated. After exposure to 3 ppm O3 in vitro, quantitative electron microscopic evaluation demonstrated that the epithelia from the FA preexposure group had significantly more necrotic cells and sloughed cells and fewer ciliated cells than the epithelia from the O3 preexposure group. Thus previous exposure to ozone in vivo induces a change in tracheal epithelium which confers resistance to ozone-induced injury in the explant exposure system.",1
"The phenylurea compound EDU (N-[2-(2-oxo-1-imidazolindinyl)ethyl]-N′-phenylurea) has been shown to protect plants from the damaging effects of ozone exposure. Models of rat lung injury, based on acute exposure to 2 ppm ozone for 3 hr and on exposure to 0.85 ppm ozone for 2 days, were used to determine whether EDU pretreatment of rats protected lungs from oxidant injury. Rats were pretreated with 100 mg/kg body wt EDU by ip administration for 2 days prior to and on the days of ozone exposure. No adverse toxicological effects of EDU pretreatment were observed. Lung superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities were significantly enhanced from 636 to 882 U/lung and from 599 to 856 U/lung, respectively. One day following acute exposure (2 ppm for 3 hr), an ozone-induced increase of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) from 0.01 to 1.18 million cells/lung was decreased to 0.68 million by EDU pretreatment. No alteration occurred in the degree of lung permeability indicated by increased lavage fluid albumin. EDU pretreatment also significantly decreased ozone-induced increases in PMN recovery after 2 days exposure to 0.85 ppm ozone from 5.54 to 2.12 million cells/lung. However, in this second case, EDU pretreatment reduced the observed ozone damage, indicated by a decrease in lavage fluid albumin and by a decrease in the macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration associated with this length of ozone exposure. The observation that EDU-treated cultured pulmonary arterial endothelial cells increased SOD and CAT activities identified a potential lung site of EDU interaction. These data demonstrated that although EDU pretreatment appears not to prevent initial ozone damage, it does reduce the infiltration of PMNs and might therefore prevent amplification of the injury associated with this cell type.",1
"Studies were undertaken to address the necessity of B-T cell contact for the enhancement of B cell differentiation caused by the heavy metal lead (Pb). Membrane segregated cultures were used so that the influences of direct B-T cell contact and T cell factors on B cell differentiation could be independently evaluated. B-T cell contact was not absolutely required for Pb's enhancement of B cell maturation to antibody forming cells (AFCs); however, enhancement of the AFC response by Pb was optimal when B-T cell interactions were allowed. These results were corroborated by use of anti-L3T4 (mouse CD4) to block CD4+ T cell-B cell interaction. Blockade of B-T cell contact with anti-L3T4 did not inhibit the enhancement of the AFC response by Pb. Additional experimentation showed that Pb enhanced the AFC response and Ig production in the presence of antigen-specific T cell help, suggesting that Pb enhances B cell differentiation by augmenting cognate help rather than by inducing a response to Pb-altered-self. In studies employing antigen-specific T cell clones, Pb was found to differentially modulate antigen presentation to TH1 versus TH2 T cell clones, in that TH1 activation was inhibited and TH2 activation was enhanced by Pb.",1
"Electron microcopic morphometry was used to study the development of lung injury during and after chronic (78 weeks) exposure to a pattern of ozone (O3) designed to simulate high urban ambient concentrations that occur in some environments. The daily exposure regimen consisted of a 13-hr background of 0.06 ppm, an exposure peak that rose from 0.06 to 0.25 ppm, and returned to the background level over a 9-hr period, and 2-hr downtime for maintenance. Rats were exposed for 1, 3, 13, and 78 weeks. Additional groups of rats exposed for 13 or 78 weeks were allowed to recover in filtered clean air for 6 or 17 weeks, respectively. Rats exposed to filtered air for the same lengths of time were used as controls. Samples from proximal alveolar regions and terminal bronchioles were obtained by microdissection. Analysis of the proximal alveolar region revealed a biphasic response. Acute tissue reactions after 1 week of exposure included epithelial inflammation, interstitial edema, interstitial cell hypertrophy, and influx of macrophages. These responses subsided after 3 weeks of exposure. Progressive epithelial and interstitial tissue responses developed with prolonged exposure and included epithelial hyperplasia, fibroblast proliferation, and interstitial matrix accumulation. The epithelial responses involved both type I and type II epithelial cells. Alveolar type I cells increased in number, became thicker, and covered a smaller average surface area. These changes persisted throughout the entire exposure and did not change during the recovery pefiod, indicating the sensitivity of these cells to injury. The main response of type II epithelial cells was cell proliferation. The accumulation of interstitial matrix after chronic exposure consisted of deposition of both increased amounts of basement membrane and collagen fibers. Interstitial matrix accumulation underwent partial recovery during follow-up periods in air; however, the thickening of the basement membrane did not resolve. Analysis of terminal bronchioles showed that short-term exposure to O3 caused a loss of ciliated cells and differentiation of preciliated and Clara cells. The bronchiolar cell population stabilized on continued exposure; however, chronic exposure resulted in structural changes, suggesting injury to both ciliated and Clara cells. We conclude that chronic exposure to low levels of O3 causes epithelial inflammation and interstitial fibrosis in the proximal alveolar region and bronchiolar epithelial cell injury.",1
"Electron microscopic observations of three cell lines infected with visna virus revealed two types of extracellular particles. The smaller of these was 65–110 mμ in diameter and contained a 20–30 mμ electron-dense core. Ordered arrays of the latter type of particle occurred rarely in the cytoplasm. After cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation of the virus, the band that contained maximal infectivity was composed of numerous particles with osmiophilic cores similar to those found in infected cell cultures. This finding suggests that such particles represent the infective agent. The second type of extracellular particle was larger (100–140 mμ in diameter), lacked an electron-dense core, and contained material similar in appearance to cellular cytoplasm. This form appeared to develop by budding from the cell surface.",1
"A human coronavirus, strain OC 43, was propagated in suckling mouse brain and purified 5000-fold with, a 90% yield. Purity of the virus was confirmed by electrophoretic, ultracentrifugal, and electron microscopic procedures. Immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis tests revealed one precipitin line with normal mouse brain, three with purified virus, and four with crude virus when tested against anti-pure virus or anti-crude virus animal serums. The association of a host cell antigen with the virion was confirmed by standard HI and CF tests. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of solubilized purified virus revealed a minimum of six polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 191,000 (No. 1), 104,000 (No. 2), 60,000 (No. 3), 47,000 (No. 4), 30,000 (No. 5), and 15,000 daltons (No. 6). A seventh band was occasionally found in the 165,000-dalton region of the gels. Four polypeptides contained carbohydrate and one contained lipid. Polypeptide No. 5 comprised 26% of the total viral protein and glycopolypeptide No. 3 comprised 23%. Three other components accounted for most of the remaining protein: polypeptide No. 4 (16%), glycopolypeptide No. 6 (14%), and glycolipopolypeptide No. 1 (13%). Glycopolypeptide No. 2 was 8% of the total protein. Bromelin digestion of the viral projections (spikes) removed glycopolypeptides No. 2 and No. 6. Association of the remaining polypeptides with structural components of the virion is only tentatively postulated. The buoyant density in potassium tartrate of the bromelin-treated virus was 1.15 g/cm3 and of the intact OC 43 virion was 1.18 g/cm3. By analytical ultracentrifugation the corrected sedimentation coefficient (s 0 20w) of the OC 43 virion was determined to be 390 ± 16 S, and the apparent molecular weight (MW a ) was calculated to be 112 ± 5 × 106 daltons.",1
"An electron microscopic study was made of the replication of California encephalitis (La Crosse strain) in cultured vertebrate cells (Vero, African green monkey kidney), in a line of cultured mosquito cells (Aedes albopictus), and in brain tissue of suckling mice. Morphologically similar virus particles, approximately 95 nm in diameter, were encountered in all three systems, and a common mode of virus assembly and maturation appeared to obtain. Virus assembly was shown to occur exclusively at internal cytomembrane interfaces, the Golgi complex appearing as the initial assembly site, which site became less focal as infection progressed due to the proliferation of Golgi smooth membranes and the dilation of cisternae and vesicles. The assembly process involved viral budding into cisternal and vesicular lumina, the virion thereby acquiring its limiting membrane. The envelope of such intracellular virions exhibited a poorly defined fringe, approximately 8 nm in width, which appeared to undergo a maturational change as the virions were discharged from the cell, such that, extracellularly, virions displayed a well-developed fringe, approximately 12 nm wide—a change especially noteworthy in the case of virions in infected mouse brain. The presence was noted in infected Vero cells—and in one instance in an infected mosquito cell—of crescent-shaped segments of thickened cisternal membrane, which possibly represented an early phase of viral assembly in which nucleocapsid aligned itself in close apposition to a membrane segment preparatory to the initiation of budding. In areas of the cytoplasm adjacent to sites of viral assembly in neurons, a fine granulofibrillar matrix was frequently found, enmeshed in which were numbers of 50–60 nm spherical structures. In a low proportion of cells from infected mosquito cultures, dense granulofibrillar masses were found in the cytoplasm. In Vero cells, infection with CE virus was cytolytic, while in A. albopictus cells, no gross cytopathic effects were manifest, and persistently infected cultures developed upon subcultivation. However, less than 10% of challenged mosquito cells became productively infected and for a proportion of these, at least as determined by electron microscopy, the infection was lethal.",1
"Analysis of the protein composition of tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), purified by an improved procedure, by polacrylamide gel electrophoresis, revealed three major structural proteins (of MW 84,000, 50,000, and 29,000d) and a minor one of MW 220,000d. The three major proteins constitute about 98% of the total viral protein and all three were shown to be glycoproteins. One of the major proteins (MW 29,000d) and the minor protein were shown to be associated with subviral particles isolated by treatment of virus with the nonionic detergent Nonidet P-40. Only traces of the other two proteins were detected in the subviral particles. Synthesis of virus-induced proteins in TSWV-infected tobacco leaves was studied by labeling infected and healthy tissue with [3H]and [14C]valine, respectively. The labeled tissues were then fractionated into crude subcellular fractions and protein patterns of healthy and infected tissues were compared by coelectrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels. Only one virus-specific protein (of MW 49,000d) was detected in the virus-enriched fractions; this corresponded with the viral structural protein of MW 50,000d.",1
"Coronavirus 229E was grown to high titers in diploid fibroblast cells under medium containing twice the normal concentrations of amino acids and vitamins. Growth curves showed maximum virus production at multiplicities of infection of 0.1 and 1; maximum titers of intracellular virus occurred at 22–24 hr and of extracellular virus at 26 hr postadsorption. Tube infectivity titers ranged from 109.0–109.5 TCID50/ml and plaque titers from 1010.2–1010.9 y PFU/ml at the time of peak virus production, when no cytopathology was evident. Virus titer dropped rapidly between 26 and 56 hr, coincident with increasing cytopathology. A single precipitin band was observed in immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis between concentrated virus preparations and antiserum to purified 229E. Neuraminidase and hemagglutinin assays were negative. Virus was purified by two procedures: adsorption to and elution from human “0” erythrocytes and CaHPO4 gel followed by equilibrium sucrose gradient centrifugation, and PEG precipitation followed by equilibrium glycerol/tartrate gradients and rate zonal sucrose or glycerol/tartrate gradients. Final lots of purified virus containing <0.02% of the crude tissue culture proteins had absorption maxima at 256 nm and minima at 241.2 nm and a mean extinction coefficient of E 1cm 1% = 54.3 at 256 nm. The fully corrected sedimentation coefficient for the intact virion was S 20,v 0 = 381 S. PAGE by different techniques revealed seven polypeptides of mean apparent molecular weights between 16,900 and 196,100. Six contained carbohydrate and one contained lipid. Electropherograms of 3H- and 14C-labeled virus were identical to those of stained gels. Two glycoproteins constituting 25% of the virion protein were identified by bromelin digestion as the spike proteins. The density in sucrose and in potassium tartrate was 1.18 g/ml for the virion and 1.15 g/ml for the “despiked” particle.",1
"A homogeneous RNA complex with a sedimentation coefficient of 70 S and an apparent molecular weight of approximately 6.1 × 106 was released from purified 32P-labeled, mouse-brain-derived OC-43 virus after treatment with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) for 15 min at 23°. The complex was highly susceptible to heat, releasing 4 S RNA fragments at 37° and breaking down to fragments of 4–70 S at 60°; it was also degraded by centrifugation through dimethyl sulfoxide gradients. Unlike tobacco mosaic virus or Rous sarcoma virus RNA, OC-43 RNA prepared by extraction with phenol-SDS or phenol-chloroform degraded into a range of fragments with coefficients of 15–55 S; 4 S RNA was also present as a minor component. This suggests that (a) extensive nicking of a large RNA molecule has occurred during viral growth, due to ribonucleases which are inactivated during phenol extractions; (b) heterogeneity for OC-43 RNA is not due to internal ribonuclease activity and fragments are held together by noncovalent linkages much weaker than those present in the 70 S retroviral RNA complex, or by small proteins; or, most probably, (c) a combination of extensive nicking and weak noncovalent linkages results in the heterogeneous denaturation products.",1
"Coronavirus A59 possesses four size classes of structural proteins which have apparent molecular weights measured by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of 23,000 (GP23), 50,000 (VP50), 90,000 (GP90), and 180,000 (GP180). VP50 is the only structural protein which is completely unaffected by protease treatment of intact virions. This species is the most highly labeled by polar amino acids such as glutamic acid and arginine and it is probably associated with the viral nucleocapsid. GP90, GP180, and GP23 are membrane-associated proteins. However, after protease treatment of virions, only 20% of the GP23 molecule is digested, whereas all of the GP90 and GP180 are removed. GP90 and GP180 appear to comprise most of the prominent layer of characteristic projections on the external surface of the viral envelope. The major portion of GP23 is presumed to lie within the lipid envelope, protected from protease digestion. GP23 and the protease resistant portion, p∗18, exhibit anomalous behavior on SDS-PAGE. After heating to 100° in SDS the electrophoretic mobility of these polypeptides is altered and several new forms of lower mobility are produced. β-Mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol exaggerate the effects of heating.",1
"Two species of membrane-associated glycoproteins have been identified in the coronavirus virion. They are readily distinguished on the basis of size, radiolabeling characteristics, and location in relation to the lipid bilayer. The larger glycoprotein is highly labeled by both radiolabeled fucose and glucosamine. This species is found in two forms, GP180 and GP90, with apparent molecular weights of 180,000 and 90,000. GP180 can be converted to GP90 in vitro by treatment of virions with trypsin. Analysis of tryptic digests of GP90 and GP180 give identical peptide patterns. Based on pronase and bromelain sensitivities, GP180/90 is the only protein which is located entirely external to the viral envelope. It appears to comprise the characteristic long, petal-shaped peplomers of the virion. The smaller glycoprotein, GP23, has an apparent molecular weight of 23,000 and is labeled by radiolabeled glucosamine but not by fucose. The level of glucosamine-labeling of GP23 is about 1/10 that of GP180/90. GP23 appears to possess two distinct domains: a smaller, carbohydrate containing region which is found outside the viral envelope, and a larger portion, highly labeled by methionine, which is integrally associated with the viral membrane. A new nomenclature is proposed for the three major coronavirus structural proteins. The two envelope glycoproteins, GP23 and GP180/90 are designated E1 and E2, respectively; the inner core protein, VP50, is designated N.",1
"Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was radiolabeled for its nucleic acid component by growth in deembryonated chicken eggs. Purified virions of IBV have a buoyant density in linear sucrose gradients of 1.17-1.18 g/cm3 and contain approximately 4% RNA by weight. The genomic ribonucleic acid of IBV shows the following characteristic: (1) It consists of one size class of single-stranded RNA having a molecular weight of 5.5-5.7 x 108 and a sedimentation coefficient of about 48 S; (2) no evidence for subunit structure is apparent since the RNA resolves as a single species with the same electrophoretic mobility in polyacrylamide gels before and after heat denaturation; (3) at least 20–30% of the RNA molecules extracted from purified virions contain sequences of polyadenylic acid of approximately 4 S size; (4) RNA obtained from detergent-disrupted virus particles by phenol-chloroform extraction is infectious for cultures of chick embryo fibroblasts, giving rise to progeny virus which is lethal for embryonated eggs. These findings, together with the observation that IBV virions do not exhibit detectable transcriptase activity, support the conclusion that the genome of this coronavirus acts directly as a messenger RNA in eukaryotic cells.",1
"Using the pH gradient electrophoretic technique of Vrijsen and Boeyé, the coat protein of poliovirus types 1 and 2 was resolved into six components, Cl to C6, instead of the classical VP1-2-3 (the much smaller polypeptide VP4 was excluded from this study). The multiple components ran true upon reelectrophoresis, and there were no technical artifacts. Their resolution did not depend on a particular method for the preparation or disruption of the virion. The C1–C6 components of pH gradient electrophoresis and the classical VP1–VP3 polypeptides were examined with regard to (i) their migration in normal and pH gradient reelectrophoresis and (ii) their kinetics of leucine incorporation in emetine-stopped pulses. It is concluded that C1 and C2 were both derived from VPl, C3 and C4 from VP2, and C5 and C6 from VP3.",1
"Influenza A viruses isolated from the cloaca of naturally infected feral ducks replicate in the lungs and in the cells lining the intestinal tract of feral and domestic ducks. Despite the low pH of the gizzard, the duck influenza viruses reach the intestines via the digestive tract and are found in high concentration in the feces. The viruses retain infectivity in fecal material for at least 30 days at 4° and for 7 days at 20°. The morphology of one strain of intestinal duck influenza virus (Hav7 Neg2) that had never been passed in embryonated eggs and was isolated from the feces was roughly spherical and fairly uniform in size and shape. However, another strain of duck influenza virus studied (Hav3 Nav6) was predominantly filamentous, suggesting that the morphology of influenza viruses in their natural hosts varies from strain to strain. After passage in the chick embryo each strain retained the morphological characteristics found in the feces. In contrast to duck influenza viruses, representative human influenza viruses of the HON1, H3N2, and Hswl Nl subtypes replicate only in the upper respiratory tract of ducks. The duck influenza viruses are more stable to low pH than human strains and retain infectivity for over 30 days in nonchlorinated river water at 0° and for 4 days at 22°. The susceptibility of ducks to infection with human and avian strains of influenza virus and the possibility of transmission to animal species through the water supply suggests that ducks may be important in the ecology of influenza viruses. The possibility of “intestinal influenza” virus vaccines is considered.",1
"Following inoculation of continuous cell lines of neural and other derivations, persistent infections are established with facility by mouse hepatitis and measles viruses. This occurs equally with the prototype MHV3 and its neurotropic variant JHM as well as with the Edmonston vaccine and SSPE Hallé measles variants. In almost every instance that the infection becomes persistent at 32.5°, virus replication is found to be thermosensitive at 39.5°; however, progeny virus derived from such infections at 32.5° is itself thermostable when replicating in the indicator, fully permissive cell lines. The new data, therefore, reveal the existence of a host-conferred interrelationship between persistence and virus restriction at elevated temperature. They indicate that the two agents with neurotropic potential, when they become established as pathogens in the nervous system, could be under close host cell regulation involving as yet unknown mechanisms.",1
"Monolayers of pancreatic β-cells from strains of mice susceptible (SJL/J) and resistant (C57BL/6J) to the development of virus-induced diabetes mellitus were inoculated with the M variant of encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus. Immunofluorescence showed that viral antigens appeared in up to 10 times more β cells from susceptible SJL/J mice than from resistant C57BL/6J mice. Infectious center assays revealed that 10–30 times more SJL/J β cells contained infectious virus than C57BL/6J β cells. Viral attachment experiments showed no difference in the binding of EMC virus when embryonic fibroblasts, pancreatic fibroblasts, and kidney cells from SJL/J and C57BL/6J mice were compared. However, at least twice as much virus attached to the pancreatic β cells from susceptible than from resistant strains of mice. Our data suggest that genetically determined differences in viral receptors on the surface of β cells may be one of the factors controlling susceptibility to EMC-induced diabetes mellitus.",1
"JHM virus (JHMV) and A59 virus (A59V) are neurotropic members of the hepatoencephalitis group of murine coronaviridae. JHMV has a markedly greater neurotropism for weanling BALB/c mice than does A59V. Both viruses display one-hit kinetics when grown in vitro in 17CL-16 cells, a clone of BALB/c3T3 cells. Virus-specific intranuclear, cytoplasmic, and surface antigens have been observed for both viruses by immunofluorescence. The intranuclear antigen appears first at about 2 hr after infection (hpi) followed by the development of the cytoplasmic and surface antigens at 3 hpi at 38.5°. Most, if not all cells that develop the intranuclear antigen, produce cytoplasmic antigen and presumably progeny virus. Progeny virus production is independent of cell fusion and formation of syncytia. Virus-specific ribonucleoprotein is synthesized in the presence of 1 μg/ml actinomycin D, a concentration sufficient to inhibit the synthesis of cellular ribonucleoprotein species that have sedimentation properties similar to the virus-specific species. The virus-specific ribonucleoprotein species that is resistant to 10 mM EDTA, presumptive virion ribonucleoprotein, has a sedimentation value in sucrose of about 230 S for JHMV and 200 S for A59V. The species of virus-specific ribonucleoprotein that are sensitive to 10 mM EDTA presumptive messenger ribonucleoprotein, are about 40–100 S in sucrose for both viruses. The purified presumptive virion RNA is about 50 S in sucrose for both viruses. The major species of presumptive mRNA of both viruses is about 18 S with secondary species of about 28 S in sucrose. Denaturation of the virus-specific RNA with heat and dimethylsulfoxide does not appreciably alter the sedimentation profiles of either the presumptive virion RNA or mRNA species.",1
We have identified nine intracellular virus-specific proteins in cells infected with JHMV or A59V. Seven virus-specific proteins were detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and two additional virus-specific proteins were detected by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The A59V- and JHMV-specific proteins differ slightly in molecular weight. Four of the nine proteins are structural proteins. The synthesis of the nine virus-specific proteins is noncoordinate with respect to time.,1
"JHMV is a neurotropic member of the hepatoencephalitis group of murine coronaviridae. The characteristics of the biology and intracellular viral RNA synthesis and the intracellular viral protein synthesis of JHMV are discussed in the two previous papers, respectively. This paper describes the neuropathogenesis of JHMV and the isolation and characterization of 34 temperature-sensitive mutants of JHMV. These mutants were selected for their inability to induce syncytia formation after low multiplicity infection (m.o.i. = 0.1 iU) in BALB/c 17CL-1 cells at 38.5° as compared to the induction of syncytia at 33°. N-Methyl-N′-nitrosoguanidine (14 mutants) and 5-fluorouridine (20 mutants) were used as mutagens at a concentration that reduced infectivity by 90–95%. Characterization of these mutants included: induction of syncytia; synthesis of JHMV-specific intracellular RNA; progeny yields at 33, 37, and 38.5°; synthesis of JHMV-specific antigens as determined by indirect immunofluorescence and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; virion thermostability; neuropathogenesis including isolation of virus from infected brain, immunofluorescence of infected brain, and histopathology of brain and spinal cord by light and transmission electron microscopy; ability to protect mice from a lethal JHMV infection; and complementation. RNA-minus ( 17 34 ), RNA-intermediate ( 14 34 ), and RNA-plus ( 3 34 ) groups were defined. One mutant, N3, produces chronic meningitis and demyelination without typical JHMV encephalitis in spite of the fact that neurons are infected as detected by immunofluorescence. This altered neuropathogenesis cannot be explained by “leakiness” or reversion. In addition, non-temperature-sensitive variants of JHMV have been selected for altered neuropathogenesis and are described.",1
"Mouse hepatitis virus, a coronavirus, was rescued from latently infected mouse neuroblastoma cells by polyethylene glycol-induced fusion to permissive cells. The isolated viruses grew to equal or higher titers than parental JHM virus at 39° but were restricted in replication at 32° and hence were cold-sensitive mutants. Neither isolate synthesized RNA at the nonpermissive temperature (32°), and temperature shift experiments indicated that the restrictive cold-sensitive step in replication occurred during an early viral function. The isolates were unable to complement each other at 32°. Although coinfection between each mutant and parental JHM virus often resulted in decreased yields of both infecting viruses, interference could not be convincingly demonstrated. Both mutants were more thermostable than parental JHM virus and could be distinguished from each other and from parental JHM virus by their thermal inactivation kinetics. The isolates were obtained from single cell clones and therefore presumed to be homogeneous; however, thermal inactivation of one (S-3JHM) indicated the possible existence of a second population. Subclones of virus prepared from each isolate were also found to be thermally stable and to retain the cold sensitive defect. No indication of a second population of S-3JHM virus was detected.",1
"Replication of avian infectious bronchitis virus in permissive BHK-21 cells is blocked when these cells are enucleated or irradiated with ultraviolet light prior to infection, or if cells are treated with α-amanitin during the virus growth cycle. This coronavirus, like influenza virus, can replicate normally in the presence of α-amanitin in Chinese hamster ovary cells which possess a drug-resistant RNA polymerase II. These findings indicate that avian infectious bronchitis virus requires the intact cell nucleus and one or more host transcriptional functions for productive infections. Preliminary data suggest that these cellular functions involve some aspect of virus-directed RNA synthesis.",1
"The infectivity of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was moderately affected by iodoacetic acid and drastically affected by N-ethylmaleimide; the antiviral effect of these sulfhydryl reagents was enhanced somewhat by the reducing agent, 2-mercaptoethanol. Reducing and/or alkylating reagents did not affect VSV hemagglutination and the impermeable sulfhydryl reagent, dextran-maleimide, did not significantly influence VSV infectivity. These data indicate that glycoprotein spikes are not the major sites for the antiviral activity of sulfhydryl reagents. [14C]Iodoacetic acid was able to penetrate the virion membrane to bind covalently to the free sulfhydryl groups of all five virion proteins, particularly the reduced disulfides of the L protein. The RNA polymerase activity of intact VSV was inhibited by iodoacetic acid and to a greater extent by N-ethylmaleimide, which probably accounts for the loss of viral infectivity caused by the permeable sulfhydryl reagents.",1
"Coronaviruses JHMV and A59V have been shown to replicate, produce viral-specific antigens and cytopathic effects (CPE) in enucleated 17CL-1 cells.",1
"Using a 32P complementary DNA (cDNA) prepared against the A59 nucleocapsid protein messenger RNA, we have investigated the extent of homology between A59 and four other strains of murine hepatitis virus (MHV). Analysis by hybridization kinetics of the annealing between A59 [32P]cDNA and infected cell RNA from the other four MHV strains demonstrated 70–80% homology. By gel transfer analysis, the A59 [32P]cDNA was able to detect subgenomic-size virus-specific RNAs in cells infected with all of the five MHV strains. A similar pattern of seven viral RNAs was detected in cells infected with A59, MHV-1, MHV-3, and JHM. In contrast, cells infected with MHV-S contained seven virus-specific RNAs, of which only the two smallest species comigrated with RNAs from the other four strains. The results suggest that as previously shown with A59 (S. Cheley, R. Anderson, M. J. Cupples, E. C. M. Lee Chan, and V. L. Morris (1981) Virology, 112, 596–604), all MHV strains tested encode a nested set of subgenomic RNAs. Analysis of [35S]methionine-labeled viral proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that each strain of MHV specified four major viral polypeptides with apparent molecular weights very similar to those previously reported for the E2, N, El, and PEI polypeptides of A59. The strong degree of interstrain homology among the five MHV strains investigated was confirmed by comparative chymotryptic peptide mapping of the viral N proteins. A majority of the chymotryptic peptides from each of the [35Sknethionine-labeled N proteins was found to coelute by high-performance liquid chromotography. Moreover, this technique of peptide mapping indicated a particularly strong relatedness between MHV-1 and MHV-S and among MHV-3, JHM, and A59.",1
"Tunicamycin has different effects on the glycosylation of the two envelope glycoproteins of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus. Unlike envelope glycoproteins of other viruses, the transmembrane glycoprotein El is glycosylated normally in the presence of tunicamycin. This suggests that glycosylation of El does not involve transfer of core oligosaccharides from dolichol pyrophosphate intermediates to asparagine residues, but may occur by 0-linked glycosylation of serine or threonine residues. Synthesis of the peplomeric glycoprotein E2 is not readily detectable in the presence of tunicamycin. Inhibition of N-linked glycosylation of E2 by tunicamycin either prevents synthesis or facilitates degradation of the protein moiety of E2. Radiolabeling with carbohydrate precursors and borate gel electrophoresis of glycopeptides show that different oligcsaccharide side chains are attached to El and E2. The two coronavirus envelope glycoproteins thus appear to be glycosylated by different mechanisms. In tunicamycin-treated cells, noninfectious virions lacking peplomers are formed at intracytoplasmic membranes and released from the cells. These virions contain normal amounts of nucleocapsid protein and glycosylated El, but lack E2. Thus the transmembrane glycoprotein El is the only viral glycoprotein required for the formation of the viral envelope or for virus maturation and release. The peplomeric glycoprotein E2 appears to be required for attachment to virus receptors on the plasma membrane. The coronavirus envelope envelope glycoprotein E1 appears to be a novel type of viral glycoprotein which is post-translationally glycosylated by a tunicamycin-resistant process that yields oligosaccharide side chains different from those of N-linked glycoproteins. These findings suggest that El may be particularly useful as a model for studying the biosynthesis, glycosylation, and intracellular transport of 0-linked glycoproteins.",1
"A plaque mutant was isolated from Kirsten mouse sarcoma virus-transformed BALB/c cells persistently infected with a mouse hepatitis virus strain MHV-S. While the wild type produced large plaques consisting of fused cells (fusion type) both at 39 and at 32°, the mutant produced small fusion-type plaques at 39°, and at 32°, only after longer incubation, plaques consisting of round dead cells (non-fusion type) were obtained. The mutant grew equally well at both temperatures. Thus, the mutant was cold sensitive in inducing cell fusion, but not in replication or in ultimate cell killing. The cold sensitivity was overcome by the addition of trypsin (0.04 to 0.05%) to the culture medium, but not by treating the virions with trypsin. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the virion proteins failed to detect differences between the wild type and the mutant. In intracellular viral proteins immunoprecipitated with anti-MHV-S rabbit serum, a protein of 68,000 daltons (68K protein) which was present in the wild type-infected cells was absent in the mutant-infected cells, but trypsin treatment or incubation at 39° of the mutant-infected cells failed to induce the 68K protein. After six to seven undiluted passages, the mutant segregated varieties of mutants which were partially or totally reverted to the wild type in phenotype, and also those whose cell fusion induction was absent even at 39°. All these mutants failed to induce the 68K protein in the infected cells. Thus, there was no linkage between the presence of 68K protein and the fusion induction. Trypsin treatment of the infected cells enabled MHV-S to form fusion plaques on otherwise resistant cells, and MHV-2, a producer of non-fusion-type plaques, to form fusion-type plaques. Protease appears to play an important role in MHV-induced cell fusion in general.",1
"Seven virus-specific, polyadenylated RNA species have been identified in mouse cells infected with the murine coronaviruses MHV-A59 (A59V) or MHV-JHM (JHMV). MHV-infected 17CL·1 cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate in the presence of actinomycin D and the cytoplasmic RNA was extracted and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. These RNA species range in size from 6.3 × 105 to 6.1 × 106 daltons. The A59V and JHMV-specific RNAs have identical molecular weights and comigrate in agarose gels. The largest intracellular RNA species is identical to RNA isolated from purified virions, as determined by agarose gel electrophoresis and oligonucleotide fingerprint studies of ribonuclease T1 digests. Oligonucleotide fingerprints of the six subgenomic RNAS show that the sequences they contain are present in virion RNA, confirming their virus-specific nature. The fingerprinting studies also demonstrate that the six subgenomic RNA species make up a nested set. The sequences present in each RNA species are also present in all larger RNA species. These larger RNAs also contain additional sequences consistent with their greater size. The subgenomic RNAs fulfull many of the criteria for mRNAs. Possible mechanisms for generating these RNAs are discussed.",1
"A major polyadenylated viral RNA of approximately 0.8 × 106 daltons was isolated from murine hepatitis virus (A59)-infected cells by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in formamide. This RNA was shown to encode the viral nucleocapsid protein by direct in vitro translation in a cell-free, reticulocyte-derived system. Single stranded 32P-labeled complementary DNA was prepared from this RNA and was demonstrated to be virus specific. Using this complementary DNA in a Northern blotting procedure, we were able to identify six major virus-specific intracellular RNA species with estimated molecular weights of 0.8, 1.1, 1.4, 1.6, 3, and 4 × 106 daltons. All of these RNA species were polyadenylated. Our results support the idea that coronavirus-infected cells contain multiple intracellular polyadenylated RNAs which share common sequences.",1
"We have determined the kinetics of virus production and virus-specific RNA synthesis in Sac(−) cells infected with mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59). Immunofluorescence showed that all cells became infected at a multiplicity of 10 PFU/cell. The virus was concentrated and purified to obtain the high titered stocks needed for these one-step growth experiments. Release of virus into the culture medium started 4 hr after infection (pi) and was complete at 10 hr pi. Synthesis of virus-specific RNA, measured by the incorporation of [3H]uridine in the presence of 1 μg/ml actinomycin D, also started at 4 hr pi and its maximum rate occurred between 6 and 8 hr pi. RNA labeled during this period was isolated from infected cells. About 50% of this RNA bound to oligo(dT)-cellulose; this material was denatured with glyoxal-dimethyl sulfoxide and analyzed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels. Seven RNA species with the following molecular weights were present: 5.6 × 106 (RNA1), 4.0 × 106 (RNA2), 3.0 × 106 (RNA3), 1.4 × 106 (RNA4), 1.2 × 106 (RNA5), 0.9 × 106 (RNA6), and 0.6 × 106 (RNA7). RNA1 comigrated with the viral genome. Artifacts caused by defective interfering particles or breakdown of RNA were excluded. To determine whether these RNA species were functional as messengers in infected cells, virus-specific RNAs present in polyribosomes were analyzed. EDTA treatment was used to discriminate between RNA present in polyribosomes and in EDTA-resistant, presumably ribonucleoprotein, particles. Most (91%) of RNA1 was present in EDTA-resistant particles; the remainder and all other RNAs synthesized between 6 and 8 hr pi were present in polyribosomes. We conclude that MHV-A59 has six subgenomic mRNAs. Since the total molecular mass (11.1 × 106 daltons) of these messengers is about twice that of the viral genome, sequence homologies must exist between the mRNAs. The position of these homologous regions and the translation products of each of the mRNAs remain to be determined.",1
"Mouse hepatitis viruses (MHV) are coronaviruses which cause various infections in mice affecting lung, intestine, liver, and other organs as well as the central nervous system. The replication of three different MHV strains was studied in mouse dissociated spinal cord cultures containing differentiated neurons and nonneuronal cells (NN) (including astrocytes). Cell tropism and maturation of each virus strain was analyzed by immunolabeling methods using antisera to the virion or to purified membrane glycoproteins (E1 and E2) and by electron microscopy (EM). Wt-JHM, which causes acute encephalitis in mice, produces acute cytopathic changes in both neurons and NN cells. In neurons, virions mature in smooth ER cisternae closely associated to the Golgi apparatus. As judged by EM, fewer virions are produced by neurons than NN cells and neurons do not fuse or stain for E2 as do NN cells. NN cells contain large inclusions made of nucleocapsid strands. A temperature-sensitive mutant of JHM, Ts8-JHM, which causes demyelination in mice, infects NN cells but not neurons. Infected NN cells synthesize E1 and E2, and contain large inclusions but few mature virions, even at permissive temperatures. These inclusions appear granular and rarely contain nucleocapsid strands in contrast to wt-JHM infection. NN cells infected with this mutant also display numerous membrane whorls. The hepatotropic strain A59 lacks tropism for neurons and primarily infects NN cells, thus resembling ts8-JHM. Infected NN cells become loaded with intracytoplasmic virions which are secreted from the cells. E1 can only be detected in the perinuclear area of these cells while E2 rapidly spreads throughout the cytoplasm. The cytoplasm of A59 infected NN cells frequently contains large tubular structures often in the lumen of the RER. In conclusion, in primary CNS cultures consisting of neurons and NN cells: (1) wt-JHM replicates in both neurons and NN cells but has different effects on these cells; (2) Ts8-JHM exhibits no productive infection of neurons, and in NN cells appears to be defective in assembly and to stimulate membrane synthesis; (3) A59 also shows tropism restricted to NN cells which produce many viruses and display differential distribution of the two virion glycoproteins. Thus, in the absence of the immune system, the MHV strains assayed exhibit differences in viral tropism, cytopathic changes, and viral assembly in CNS cells, and these differences may account for the different disease patterns.",1
"Hybridoma cell lines producing monoclonal antibodies to the JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus-4 (MHV-4) were established. By indirect immunofluorescence and immune precipitation, monoclonal antibodies of three viral polypeptide specificities were characterized. Monoclonal antibodies to nucleocapsid reacted in the cytoplasm of infected cells and precipitated the 60,000d nucleocapsid polypeptide (VP-4) of MHV-4. Other monoclonal antibodies reacted both in the cytoplasm and on the surface of infected cells and were found to precipitate the 170,000d viral glycoprotein (GP-1). A third set of monoclonal antibodies reacted both in the cytoplasm and on the surface of infected cells and precipitated the 25,000d viral glycoprotein (GP-5) and its precursor VP-6 (23,000d). AntiGP-1 alone had direct neutralizing activity for MHV-4 virus, while in the presence of complement both anti-GP-1 and anti-GP-5 neutralized virus. Only anti-GP-1 had the ability to inhibit the spread of infection due to fusion in L241 cells. Thus, the viral glycoprotein GP-1 likely contains both the attachment and fusion activities of MHV-4.",1
"The kinetics of equine arteritis virus growth and virus-specific RNA synthesis at 40° were determined in BHK-21 cells. Maximum titers of infectious virus (∼107 PFU/ml) were observed at 12 hr p.i., while incorporation of [3H]uridine into virus-specific RNA became detectable at 4 hr p.i. and increased to reach a maximum rate at 8 hr p.i. This RNA was labeled between 2.5 and 7 hr p.i. and isolated from infected cells. About 44% bound to oligo(dT)-cellulose; this material was denatured using glyoxal and dimethyl sulfoxide and analyzed by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose-urea gel. Six virus-specific RNA species were found having the following molecular weights: 4.3 × 106 (RNA1), 1.3 × 106 (RNA2), 0.9 × 106 (RNA3), 0.7 × 106 (RNA4), 0.3 × 106 (RNA5), and 0.2 × 106 (RNA6). RNA1 comigrated with the viral genome. Artifacts caused by defective interfering particles or breakdown of RNA were excluded. Subsequently, the target sizes of the templates for the synthesis of the genome-sized RNA and the five subgenomic RNAs were determined by uv transcription mapping. Infected cells were irradiated at 6.5 hr p.i. The effect o of reasing uv doses on the RNA synthesis was determined by quantitation of the individual RNAs after separation by agarose gel electrophoresis. The uv target sizes calculated for the templates for RNAs 2–5 were very close to the physical size of RNA1. The target size of the template of RNA6 was smaller (2.8 × 106 daltons), although much greater than its physical size. The data are consistent with a model in which the individual RNAs are derived from a larger precursor RNA molecule. The consequences of these findings for the taxonomy of Togaviridae are discussed.",1
"The covalent attachment of fatty acids to the glycoproteins of orthomyxo-, paramyxo, alpha-, and coronavirus was studied. All enveloped viruses analyzed afford covalently bound fatty acid in at least one species of their spike glycoproteins. No internal components of the viruses studied including the hydrophobic M proteins of myxo- and rhabdoviruses contained fatty acid. Analysis of myxovirus particles devoid of the exposed portions of their spikes revealed that fatty acids are linked to the hydrophobic tail fragment of the glycoprotein which is associated with the viral lipid bilayer. With influenza virus hemagglutinin the fatty acid attachment site could be located at the cyanogen bromide peptide of the small subunit (HA2) which contains the membrane-embedded region of the polypeptide. The binding of fatty acids to viral glycoproteins occurs in a wide range of host cells including mammalian, avian, and insect cells.",1
"The synthesis and processing of the nucleocapsid protein (pp60) of the JHM strain of murine coronaviruses were examined. Pulse-chase experiments showed that pp60 was synthesized initially as a protein of approximately 57,000 in molecular weight (p57). Immunoprecipitation using mouse anti-JHMV antiserum indicated that p57 was virus specific. Immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibodies specific for pp60 showed that p57 was antigenically related to pp60 and was not phosphorylated, while the intracellular protein that comigrated with the virion nucleocapsid protein, pp60, was phosphorylated. The p57 was found exclusively in the cytosol while the majority of pp60 was associated with the membrane fraction but pp60 was not an integral membrane protein.",1
"Recombinants between fowl plague virus (FPV, H7N1) and the Hong Kong (H3N2) or Singapore (H2N2) influenza virus strains carrying the hemagglutinin of FPV and the neuraminidase of the human strains form only very tiny plaques at 33°, but normal plaques at 37°. One recombinant (113/Ho) has been studied in more detail. It multiplies only very slowly at 33°, the nonpermissive temperature. Adsorption and penetration are normal at 33°, but synthesis of protein is impeded. Temperature-shift experiments suggest that the synthesis of viral mRNA is slowed at 33°. 113/Ho does not agglutinate chicken erythrocytes at 40°, as the parent viruses do. 113/Ho can be adapted to grow normally at 33°. The frequency of adaptation is comparable to reversion of a single point mutation (ca. 10−5). Recombinants which grow well at 37° but not at 33° are called cold-sensitive (cs) recombinants.",1
"The structural polypeptides of baculoviruses of Autographa californica (AcMNPV) and Porthetria dispar (PdMNPV) were analyzed by two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis. Purified proteins were solubilized in urea-NP40 mix and separated by isoelectric focusing in the first dimension; electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) separated proteins by molecular weight in the second dimension. Eighty-one acidic polypeptides ranging in molecular weight from 13,500 to 86,000 Da were resolved in AcMNPV enveloped virions. The predominant polypeptide had a molecular weight of 41,500 and was considered to be the major capsid protein. Nucleocapsids from AcMNPV were resolved into 64 polypeptides. At least 11 of the polypeptides, including most of the high molecular weight proteins, that were not resolved in nucleocapsids were considered to be envelope proteins. For PdMNPV enveloped virions, there were 95 acidic polypeptides ranging in molecular weight from 13,500 to 85,500. The predominant polypeptide had a molecular weight of 46,500 Da. Polyhedral proteins (polyhedrin) isolated from protease-inactivated polyhedra and separable into a single major polypeptide (approx. 31,000) on one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were resolved into six polypeptides for both viruses. All six polyhedrin polypeptides had the same molecular weight, but their isoelectric points ranged from pH 5.3 to 5.9 for AcMNPV and from pH 5.7 to 6.2 for PdMNPV. These six polypeptides were also detected when protease-inactivated or noninactivated whole polyhedra were analyzed directly by 2-D electrophoresis. It is assumed that not all the observed baculovirus polypeptides were unique species. Some proteins, especially the polyhedrin polypeptides, appeared to be related and had altered mobilities as a consequence of post-translational modifications.",1
"Twenty 5-fluorouracil-induced temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 were isolated from 1284 virus clones. Mutants were preselected on the basis of their inability to induce syncytia in infected cells at the restrictive temperature (40°) vs the permissive temperature (31°). Of these mutants, only those with a relative plating efficiency 40° 31° of 3 × 10−3 or smaller were kept. Virus yields at 40° compared to 37° and 31° (leakiness) were determined. Most mutants (16) were RNA−, i.e., unable to synthesize virus-specific RNA at the restrictive temperature. The other four were RNA+. No qualitative differences were detected in the virus-specific RNAs in cells infected with RNA+ ts-mutants, both at 31° and 40°. Virus-specific proteins present in cells infected with is-171 (RNA−) and the RNA+-mutants (ts-43, is-201, is-209, and is-279) were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of immunoprecipitates. No qualitative differences in the pattern of virus-specific cellular proteins were detected among the mutants except for an additional polypeptide of about 46,000 daltons in ts-209-infected cells. Finally, the neuropathogenic properties of eight of the mutants were investigated. Whereas 102 PFU of wild-type virus injected intracerebrally killed 50 to 100% of 4-week-old Balc/c mice within 1 week, the mutants were highly attenuated. A dose of 105 PFU lead to no or transient disease. However, 4 weeks after infection with ts 342, is-43, or is-201 obvious histological changes were observed in brain and spinal cord of clinically healthy mice.",1
"Mouse hepatitis virus persists in cultures of a subline (designated LM-K) of mouse LM cells but produces a lytic infection in L-2 cells. Persistence in the LM-K cells was not accompanied by production of is mutants or of soluble anti-MHV factors. Infectious center assay demonstrated an approximately 500-fold lower level of infectibility by MHV of the LM-K cells as compared to L-2 cells. On an infected cell basis, production levels of infectious progeny and viral RNA were comparable between the two cell lines. The extent of virus-induced cell-cell fusion, however, was markedly reduced in the LM-K cells. Cell-mixing experiments showed that both infected L-2 and LM-K cells have the capacity of fusing with neighboring uninfected L-2 cells but not with uninfected LM-K cells. This suggests that the decreased level of fusion observed in the LM-K infection is due not to absence of viral fusion protein at the cell surface, but rather to an inherent resistance of the LM-K cell membrane to MHV-induced fusion. It is believed that such fusion resistance in LM-K cells moderates virus dissemination throughout the culture, thereby contributing to a state of virus persistence.",1
"Monoclonal antibodies were produced to JHMV-DL, a neurotropic member of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) or murine coronavirus group. Of 23 antibodies isolated, 10 were specific for the major envelope glycoprotein, gp180/90, 10 for the nucleocapsid protein, pp60, and 3 for the minor envelope glycoprotein, gp25. Eleven different MHV isolates were used in antibody binding assays to study antigenic relationships among the viruses. Each MHV isolate tested had a unique pattern of antibody binding, indicating that each is a distinct strain. Conservation of JHMV-DL antigenic determinants varied among the three proteins, with pp60 showing intermediate conservation, gp180/90 little conservation, and gp25 marked conservation in the different MHV strains. Monoclonal antibodies to pp60 proved most useful in delineating antigenic relationships among MHV strains. These antigenic groups correlated with pathogenic types, indicating that pp60 may be one of the gene products which mediates the distinct disease patterns manifested by different murine coronaviruses.",1
"Pulse labeling with tritiated mannose was used to follow the time course of Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) glycoprotein synthesis in Spodoptera frugiperda IPLB-21 cells. Nine viral-induced intracellular glycoproteins were first detected from as early as 2 hr postinoculation (67K, early phase) to as late as 14 hr (36K and 19K glycoproteins, intermediate phase). Glycosylation of these proteins was observed to continue to the end of the experiment (28 hr postinoculation). Seven of these intracellular glycoproteins could also be detected in infected Trichoplusia ni TN-368 cells 24 hr postinoculation. When the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin was present (from 0 hr postinoculation) there was no detectable glycosylation of any of these viral-induced glycoproteins. Metabolic labeling of the nonoccluded virus budded from IPLB-21 and TN-368 with tritiated mannose or N-acetylglucosamine identified 11 structural glycoproteins, 8 of which were identical in both virus preparations. All of these structural glycoproteins were sensitive to the inhibitory action of tunicamycin. A single 42K structural glycoprotein was detected (with acetylglucosamine only) in the occluded form of AcNPV. Glycosylation of this structural protein appeared to be insensitive to tunicamycin. Lactoperoxidase-catalyzed radioiodination was used to determine which of the virus structural glycoproteins are exposed on the virion surface.",1
"Monoclonal hybridoma antibodies (MAb) of defined polypeptide specificity and biological activity were used in a competition binding assay to identify antibody binding sites (epitopes) on the glycoproteins of murine hepatitis virus-4 strain JHM (MHV-4). Individual MAb were labeled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and used as probes in a competition enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Four topographically distinct antigenic sites were detected on the E2 glycoprotein of MHV-4. Antibodies reacting with these four determinants provisionally designated A(E2), B(E2), C(E2), and D(E2) had corresponding biological activities (M. J. Buchmeier, H. A. Lewicki, P. J. Talbot, and R. L. Knobler (1984) Virology 132, 261–270). Antibodies to sites A(E2) and B(E2) mediated virus neutralization in vitro and passively protected mice against lethal virus challenge in vivo. Antibody to site C(E2) neutralized virus efficiently in vitro but did not alter disease in vivo, while antibody to site D(E2) neither neutralized nor protected. Two major nonoverlapping antigenic sites were defined on the El glycoprotein. Overlapping epitopes A(El) and B(El) constituted one site and epitope C(E1) the other.",1
"Monoclonal hybridoma antibodies directed against the polypeptides of murine hepatitis virus-4 (JHM strain) were tested for their ability to alter the course of a normally lethal intracerebral virus challenge. Three monoclonal antibodies directed against two distinct epitopes on the E2 glycoprotein of MHV-4 protected mice against lethal virus challenge and converted the infection from fatal encephalomyelitis to demyelination. A single neutralizing antibody directed against a third epitope on E2 as well as seven nonneutralizing antibodies to E2, E1, and N polypeptides did not protect against challenge. In mice which received protective antibody, MHV-4 infection was not blocked, however, virus grew to lower titers in liver and brain, and virus replication in the CNS was more restricted than in unprotected mice. Decreased involvement of neurons in the brains of protected mice was observed, and no evidence of neuronal infection in the spinal cords was found. In contrast, oligodendrocytes were infected in the presence of protective antibody, and evidence of demylination associated with mononuclear cell infiltration was found. These studies demonstrate that antibody to a single epitope on a viral glycoprotein can substantially alter the course and phenotype of disease.",1
"Indomethacin, a potent nonsteroidal inhibitor of prostaglandin synthetase (cyclooxygenase) reduced yields of infectious vesicular stomatitis virus in HEp-2 cells more than 99% if added to cultures at levels of 10−3 M either before or after infection. Other permissive cell lines differed according to the treatment period and drug level required for restricting productive infections. The inhibitory effect of indomethacin was progressively reduced if infection of cells was delayed for increasing times after drug removal. Strong inhibition of viral replication also occurred in cells treated with the cyclooxygenase antagonists naproxen, phenylbutazone, and oxyphenylbutazone whereas phenacetin, which does not block cyclooxygenase function, was inactive. Enhanced viral replication occurred in indomethacin-treated HEp-2 cultures when these cells were subsequently exposed to such substances as prostaglandin El, cyclic AMP, or insulin. Conversely, indomethacin-treated cells remained restrictive for VSV if they were subsequently exposed to metabolic inhibitors of functional DNA (actinomycin D or mitomycin C), messenger RNA synthesis (α-amanitin), or protein synthesis (cycloheximide) at concentrations that normally do not compromise viral replication. Pretreatment of HEp-2 cells with mitomycin C markedly shifted the dose response for indomethacin-mediated inhibition of VSV from a 90% inhibitory dose of about 10−4 M to one of 10−9 M or lower. These findings suggest that preexisting host factors essential for replication of VSV, although rendered nonfunctional by the drug indomethacin, can be replenished unless their synthesis is blocked by various classes of metabolic inhibitors.",1
"When Wistar Furth rats are inoculated intracerebrally with the murine hepatitis virus JHM they often develop a demyelinating disease with resulting hind leg paralysis. Using an RNA transfer procedure and hybridization kinetic analysis, the virus-specific RNA in these rats was characterized. The pattern of JHM-specific RNA varied with individual infections of Wistar Furth rats. However, two species of JHM-specific RNA, the nucleocapsid and a 2.1–2.4 × 106-Da RNA species were generally present. A general decrease in JHM-specific RNA in brains' and spinal cord samples taken later than 20 days postinoculation was observed; however, JHM-specific RNA persisted in the spinal cord longer than in the brain of these rats.",1
"JHM virus, when inoculated into neonatal rats, can cause either a rapidly fatal acute encephalomyelitis or, after longer incubation periods, a paralytic disease. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum anti-JHM virus IgG concentrations present in rats prior to onset of clinical symptoms or during the acute and paralytic phases of disease were compared. High CSF/serum ratios, indicative of local antibody production in the CNS, were noted only where disease was demonstrable suggesting that local antibody production accompanied the infection but did not prevent the neurological disease. Among animals in which neurologic symptoms had not become manifest, only those with elevated CSF/serum ratios were found to have histological CNS lesions. Immunofluorescent microscopy indicated that viral antigens were present in both glia and neurons. Antigen-positive cells were frequently present in histologically normal CNS tissue, while regions of necrosis were antigen negative. Testing for the presence of viral RNA with JHM cDNA probes revealed that the virus was rapidly disseminated throughout the CNS, presumably establishing centers of infection prior to the development of recognizable tissue damage. Viral RNA was also detected in the CNS following recovery from paralysis and as late as 5 months postinfection, where no disease occurred. These findings indicate that, although infection by JHM virus can spread rapidly throughout the CNS, formation of lesions during chronic disease is a slower process. The current data and previous observations suggest that JHM virus can remain in a latent state for periods of at least several months in rats without apparent neurologic disease despite the absence of any known provirus phase in the replicative strategy of coronaviruses.",1
"Polyadenylated RNA was isolated from fibroblast cultures infected with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) strain AD169 during the late phase of viral replication. The RNA was selected by hybridization to a series of cosmid clones containing the entire viral genome in partially overlapping segments. Translation of this RNA in a reticulocyte cell-free system allowed the mapping of virus specific polypeptides. Nine polypeptides synthesized in vitro comigrated with major virion structural proteins. An in vitro-translated protein of 71 kDa was precipitated by a monoclonal antibody directed against the phosphorylated internal envelope protein of 71 kDa. The map coordinates of viral DNA coding for this phosphoprotein were localized by hybrid selection with subcloned DNA fragments, and the direction of transcription was determined by hybrid selection with single-stranded DNA cloned in bacteriophage vector M13mp9. An in vitro translation with size-fractionated RNA, combined with immunoprecipitation and Northern blot analyses, indicated that an mRNA of 4 kb encodes the 71-kDa phosphoprotein. An mRNA of the same size, map coordinates, and orientation was translated into an abundant 65-kDa polypeptide which had the same size as the major structural phosphoprotein of HCMV.",1
"The replication of the murine coronaviruses MHV3 and JHM has been studied in somatic cell hybrids formed between murine fibroblast L2 cells which support lytic infections with both these agents, and rat RN2 Schwannoma cells which support the replication of JHM in a temperature-sensitive, persistent manner but are restrictive to the replication of MHV3. The results described in this report indicate that the totally permissive state is dominant over the persistent or restricted state since the hybrid cells permit the replication of both these viral agents in a lytic manner.",1
"The genomic RNA and intracellular RNA of mouse hepatitis virus, strain JHM (MHV-JHM) and two plaque mutants (la and 2c), which have been isolated from a persistently infected culture (JHM-CC), have been analyzed by T1-resistant oligonucleotide finger-printing. The genomic RNA of the virus population (JHM-CC virus) released from different passage levels of the same persistent infection has also been analyzed. The analysis shows the locations within the genomic and intracellular RNAs of more than 45 T1-resistant oligonucleotides and confirm earlier studies (J. L. Leibowitz, K. C. Wilhelmsen, and C. W. Bond (1981), Virology 114, 39–51), showing that the six subgenomic RNAs of MHV-JHM form a 3′ coterminal nested set which extends for different lengths in a 5′ direction. The analysis also identifies in each subgenomic RNA those large T1 oligonucleotides derived from noncontiguous regions of the genome during mRNA synthesis. Two important conclusions can be reached from analysis of the mutant viruses. First, the virus population released from the persistent infection represents a fairly constant mixture of viruses, and the fluctuating emergence of variants as predominant species in the culture does not occur. Second, the data indicate that for particular intracellular RNAs of mutant viruses the sequence rearrangements occurring during subgenomic mRNA synthesis are different from those in the corresponding intracellular RNA of wild-type virus. The result may indicate a potential flexibility in the leader/body fusion process that has not been previously recognized.",1
"Previously it was shown that AcV1, a neutralizing monoclonal antibody of the Autographs californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus-budded phenotype reacted with a surface antigen present on infected cells during virus budding, and in the viral envelope (L. E. Volkman, P. A. Goldsmith, R. T. Hess, and P. Faulkner (1984), Virology 133, 354–362). Radioimmune precipitation of solubilized, [35S]methionine-labeled budded virus with AcV1 and analysis on SDS-PAGE revealed four bands consistently: one major band at 64,000 Da, and three minor bands at 127,000, 59,000, and 49,000 Da. The reason for the appearance of four bands instead of one was unclear. Data suggest that two of the bands, 49K and 59K, are aberrant, and are the products of sample preparation conditions. Further, evidence is presented that the 127K band is composed of dimers of the 64K protein, and that under nonreducing conditions, oligomers (trimers and tetramers) of 64K protein can also be detected. BVGP 64 is additionally shown to be phosphorylated and to have an isoelectric point of 3.15. The BVGP 64 epitope reactive with AcV1 is destroyed by interaction with SDS. This could account for the lack of neutralizing activity of antiserum made to the SDS-PAGE purified BVGP 64.",1
"A neutralizing monoclonal antibody of the budded phenotype of Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrons virus did not react with the occluded form of the virus as determined by neutralization, ELISA, and indirect immunoperoxidase staining. The antibody did react with the surface of infected cells in the prepolyhedra stage of cytopathic effect, the period of active virus budding. Immunoelectron microscopy indicated the antigen(s) reactive with the neutralizing antibody was present all around the viral envelope, but was more highly concentrated at the end with peplomers. Four proteins were immunoprecipitated from solubilized, radiolabeled budded virus preparations with the monoclonal antibody. The major protein had a molecular weight of approximately 64,000, while the other three were approximately 127,000, 59,000, and 49,000. All four proteins could be labeled with N-acetyl-d-[1-3H]glucosamine. This glycosylation reaction could be inhibited by tunicamycin.",1
"After six to eight serial undiluted passages of mouse hepatitis virus (JHM strain) in DBT cell culture, a decrease in the yield of infectious virus occurred, and with further passages fluctuating yields of infectious virus were observed. The serially passaged virus interfered with the multiplication of the standard JHM virus, but not with vesicular stomatitis virus. After sucrose equilibrium centrifugation of high passage virus, a single peak contained both infectious virus and interfering activity. This virus population resembled the original JHM virus in its structural proteins, but it contained an increased proportion of a protein with a molecular weight of 65 × 103. Genomic RNA from standard JHM virus contained a single species of RNA with a molecular weight of 5.4 × 106. After five undiluted passages, however, the virion population contained two RNA species with molecular weights of 5.4 × 106 and 5.2 × 106. RNase T1 resistant oligonucleotide finger-printing of these RNAs showed that the lower molecular weight RNA had lost several oligonucleotide spots that were present in the genomic RNA of the standard JHM virus. After several serial diluted passages of passage 10 virus, a single virus population was obtained which again had only standard virus RNA with a molecular weight of 5.4 × 106 and lacked interfering activity. These results indicated that defective interfering particles were generated by serial undiluted passages of JHM virus.",1
"Two temporally and enzymatically distinct RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activities associated with membranes of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-infected cells have been identified previously [Brayton et al., J. Virol. 42, 847–853 (1982)]. In this paper, the subcellular distribution and functions of these two polymerases were examined. Fractionation of the postnuclear membranes by sucrose gradient sedimentation showed that the early polymerase activity (detected at 1 hr p.i.) was homogeneous, while the late polymeras e (6 hr p.i.) was associated with two distinct membrane fractions. The early polymerase synthesized a single RNA species of viral genomic size and negative sense. In contrast, the light peak of the late polymerase synthesized genomic-sized RNA of positive sense, while the heavy peak of the activity synthesized positive-sensed genomic and subgenomic mRNAs. These findings suggest that the light peak of the late polymerase represents a replication complex while the heavy peak represents a transcription complex. They also establish the essential features of the mode of replication of MHV.",1
"The effect of tunicamycin and monensin on the biosynthesis, intracellular transport, and maturation of bovine herpesvirus type-1 (BHV-1) glycoproteins was examined. Tunicamycin completely inhibited the production of infectious virus particles and significantly reduced the incorporation of [3H]glucosamine into viral glycoproteins. In the presence of monensin, reduced amounts of infectious virus particles were produced, which was mainly due to inhibition of virus release, rather than virus production. Monensin only slightly inhibited viral glycoprotein synthesis. The effects of these compounds on infectivity indicated that glycosylation is required for the production of infectious virus, though complete processing of the glycoproteins is not essential. In addition, egress of the virions from infected cells probably requires a functional Golgi complex. In the presence of tunicamycin or monensin various degrees of glycosylation of the major glycoproteins occurred, consequently their rates of migration differed from that of the normal glycoproteins. Tunicamycin completely blocked glycosylation of GVP 6/11a/16 and GVP 7. In contrast, GVP 3/9 and GVP 11b were partially glycosyaated in the presence of tunicamycin. These results indicated that GVP 6/11a/16 and GVP 7 are N-linked glycoproteins, but GVP 3/9 and GVP 11b contain both N- and O-linked oligosaccharide side chains. Tunicamycin blocked the transport of all viral glycoproteins to the cell surface, suggesting that glycosylation is required for this process. In the presence of monensin, the viral glycoproteins were transported and expressed on the cell surface indicating that transport does not require complete processing of the glycoproteins and may occur via a Golgi-independent pathway. In addition, monensin-treated BHV-1 infected cells could act as target cells in an antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity assay. Thus, complete glycosylation may not be essential for maintenance of antigenicity and participation in immune destruction.",1
"A unique subline of BALB/c mice, designated BALB/cV, exhibits an intermediate mammary tumor incidence (47%) and harbors a distinct milk-transmitted mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). The BALB/cV subline was used to study the molecular basis of potential virus-host interactions involving cell surface-expressed MMTV proteins. Cell surface iodination identified virus-specific proteins expressed on BALB/cv primary mammary tumor cells grown in culture. In contrast to (C3H)MMTV-producing cell lines which expressed MMTV gp52, BALB/cV tumor cells lacked gp52 and expressed instead a 68K, env-related protein. The 68K env protein was also detected on the surface of metabolically labeled BALB/cV tumor cells by an external immunoprecipitation technique. The expression of 68K env was restricted to mammary tissues of BALB/cV mice that also expressed other MMTV proteins. Biochemical analysis established that 68K env was not modified by N-linked glycosylation. 125I-labeled 68K env was rapidly released into the media of tumor cell cultures and was recovered both in the form of a soluble protein and in a 100,000 g pellet. The biologic function of this cell surface-expressed viral protein remains unknown.",1
"Monoclonal antibodies to varicella zoster virus (VZV) glycoproteins were used to study the processing of three glycoproteins with molecular weights of 83K–94K (gp 2), 64K (gp 3), and 55K (gp 5). Immunoprecipitation experiments performed with VZV-infected cells, pulse labeled with [3H]glucosamine in the presence of tunicamycin, suggest that O-linked oligosaccharide is present on the glycoprotein of gp 2. Use of the enzyme endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H revealed that the fully processed form of gp 3 had high-mannose type and that of gp 5 had only complex type of N-linked oligosaccharides. Experiments with monensin suggest that the precursor form (116K) of gp 3 is cleaved during the processing from Golgi apparatus to cell surface membrane. The extension of O-linked oligosaccharide chain and the complex type of N-linked oligosaccharide chains also occurs during this processing.",1
"The coronaviruses, ubiquitous in mammals, including man, manifest serotype-related predeliction for different tissues. This presentation deals with specificity of the murine viscerotropic MHV3 and neurotropic JHMV for explanted cells from the CNS of newborn, inbred, Wistar-Furth rats. An unambiguous tropism of MHV3 for astrocytes and JHMV for oligodendrocytes is demonstrated. With the latter cell-virus interaction, relatively small differences in spatial density of oligodendrocytes influence profoundly the duration of persistence and virus yield. The in vitro temporal program of oligodendrocyte differentiation, monitored by induction of a myelin-related enzyme, 2′:3′-cyclic nucleotide-3′-phosphohydrolase, corresponds to that occurring in vivo (F. A. McMorris, J. Neurochem. 41, 506–515, 1983). It is complete within 15–21 days and is coincident with the onset of insusceptibility to disease caused by JHMV. Experimental elevation of intracellular cyclic-AMP levels, presumed to reflect oligodendrocyte differentiation, likewise suppresses JHMV replication without affecting that of MHV3 in astrocytes. On the basis of these data it is concluded that in vitro interaction of JHMV with oligodendrocytes reflects accurately the in vivo host control over the tropism and expression of this virus, thereby effecting the progressive, demyelinative disease, process.",1
"In order to detect the structural proteins linked with disulfide bonds, CIV was solubilized and electrophoresed under nonreducing conditions in the first dimension and then under reducing conditions in the second dimension. The viral polypeptides linked originally with disulfide bonds were separated into subunits. The complexes were trimers (P′50) or dimers (P60 and P10). The apparent molecular weights of P81, P53, and P49 changed significantly according to the composition of the lysis buffer used, suggesting that the differences in their molecular weights were due to conformational changes produced by reduction of their intramolecular disulfide bonds. Sulfhydryl-containing polypeptides (P′50-P50, P60, P100, and P33) were detected by N-[14C]ethylmaleimide, and the accessibility of these residues was analyzed after successive stripping of the CIV particle. Radioiodination of external polypeptides by [125I]iodosulfanilic acid shows only one intensively labeled spot corresponding to the P50 polypeptide, whereas P′50 was only slightly labeled. Six viral polypeptides P81, P60, P31, P17, P13, and P10 were revealed to possess high affinity for CIV DNA. A structural model of CIV is proposed and discussed.",1
"Mouse hepatitis viruses (MHV) of different virulence for mice were studied with respect to interferon (IFN) sensitivity. The growth of low-virulent MHV-S and intermediately virulent MHV-JHM was significantly suppressed in IFN-treated L cells compared with untreated cells. However, a comparable suppression of the growth of highly virulent MHV-2 was not observed in IFN-treated cells. This differential effect of IFN treatment could also be demonstrated at the level of viral mRNA and viral proteins. In cells infected with MHV-S or MHV-JHM the amount of viral mRNAs was remarkably reduced by IFN treatment. Also the levels of the major intracellular viral proteins, in particular the E, protein, were affected by IFN treatment. Similar effects could not be demonstrated in MHV-2-infected cells. These results suggest that during MHV-S or MHV-JHM infection IFN treatment suppresses virus replication at several stages. The significance of these results is discussed in terms of the pathogenecity of these viruses.",1
"The SV40-encoded transforming protein, large tumor antigen (T-ag), is multifunctional. Chemical modifications of the T-ag polypeptide may be important for its multifunctional capacity. T-ag is additionally modified by glycosylation. T-ag was metabolically labeled in SV40-infected cells with tritiated galactose or glucosamine, but not with mannose or fucose. The identity of glycosylated T-ag was established by immunoprecipitation with a variety of T-ag-specific antisera, including monoclonal antibodies. Incorporation of labeled sugar into T-ag was inhibited in the presence of excess unlabeled sugars, but not in the presence of excess unlabeled amino acids. Labeled monosaccharides could be preferentially removed from T-ag with a mixture of glycosidic enzymes. In addition, galactose was removed from purified T-ag by acid hydrolysis and identified as such by thin-layer chromatography. T-ag oligosaccharides were resistant to treatment with EndoH, and glycosylation was not inhibited by tunicamycin. Together, these data strongly suggest that T-ag is glycosylated. Several characteristics, including lack of mannose labeling, EndoH resistance, and tunicamycin resistance, suggest that T-ag is not an N-linked glycoprotein. Rather, these properties are more consistent with the identification of T-ag as an O-linked glycoprotein.",1
"Ammonium chloride at a concentration of 20 mM delayed by 4–5 hr the production of virus progeny in mouse L-2 cells infected at high multiplicity with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). This delay was seen in the production of both intracellular and extracellular virus. However, the final titers were similar to those produced by MHV-infected cells maintained in normal medium. The manifestation of virus-induced cell fusion was similarly found to be delayed, but not otherwise decreased in severity, when ammonium chloride was present in the culture medium. Ammonium chloride caused similar delays in production of virus-specific, positive-sense RNAs and of viral polypeptides. The relative proportions and apparent molecular weights of viral RNAs and polypeptides were similar to those found in MHV-infected cells cultured in normal medium. In vitro translation of endogenously produced viral RNAs in cell extracts, prepared from MHV-infected cells, was not inhibited by ammonium chloride. Thus, ammonium chloride has no specific, inhibitory effect on viral protein synthesis. Ammonium chloride did not reduce the number of virus-infected cells in culture, as monitored by infectious center assay. Analysis of early events in MHV infection showed that ammonium chloride did not affect adsorption or internalization of MHV by L-2 cells. However, the subsequent eclipse phase, as monitored by decline in infectivity of internalized virus inoculum proceeded less efficiently in the presence of ammonium chloride. On the basis of the known inhibitory effects of ammonium chloride on lysosomal/endosomal functions, the results suggest an endosomal mechanism of MHV uncoating. Thus the primary effect of ammonium chloride on MHV infection of L-2 cells is to attenuate virus uncoating, thereby chronologically displacing all subsequent virus-encoded functions.",1
"Mouse oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, in primary cerebral explant cultures, were infected with JHMV and MHV3 coronaviruses. Contrary to previous findings with neural cells from the rat (S. Beushausen and S. Dales, 1985, Virology 141, 89–101), these agents show no discrimination in the tropism and have the ability to replicate in either type of murine glial cell. Effects of the differentiation inducer dbcAMP on levels of the myelin-specific enzyme 2′:3′-cyclic nucleotide-3′-phosphohydrolase (CNPase) activity and virus replication were determined. In the mouse system there was a gradual, continuous elevation of CNPase beyond 30 days whereas in comparable rat cell cultures maximum CNPase enhancement is elicited within 21 days (F. A. McMorris,1983, J. Neurochem. 41, 506–515). After dbcAMP treatment replication of both coronaviruses was profoundly suppressed in murine oligodendrocytes, consistent with our findings on JHMV replication in treated rat oligodendrocytes. By contrast the replication of JHMV and MHV3 in dbcAMP-treated murine astrocytes was influenced only marginally. These findings provide further support for the hypothesis that susceptibility of rodents to CNS infection by coronaviruses is determined, in part, by the age-related maturation process of oligodendrocytes.",1
"During the replication cycle of Sindbis virus minus-strand synthesis stops normally at the time that plus-strand synthesis reaches a maximum rate. We have isolated and characterized revertants of ts24, a member of the A complementation group of Sindbis HR mutants, that we had demonstrated previously to have a temperature-sensitive defect in the regulation of minus-strand synthesis. These revertants of ts24 replicated efficiently at 40° but nevertheless retained the temperature sensitive defect in the regulation of minus-strand synthesis: they continued to synthesize minus strands late in the replication cycle at 40° but not at 30° and in the presence or absence of protein synthesis. Although failure to regulate the synthesis of minus strands resulted in continuous minus-strand synthesis and in the accumulation of minus strands, the rate of plus-strand synthesis was not increased concertedly. Minus strands synthesized after the rate of plus-strand synthesis had become constant were demonstrated to be utilized as templates for 26 S mRNA synthesis. Thus, the change from an increasing to a constant rate of plus-strand synthesis during the alphavirus replication cycle cannot be governed solely by the number of minus strands that accumulate in infected cells. We present a model for the preferential utilization of minus strands as a mechanism for the cessation of minus-strand synthesis that occurs normally during alphavirus replication.",1
"The 3′ end of the 20-kb genome of the Purdue strain of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) was copied into eDNA after priming with oligo(dT) and the double-stranded product was cloned into the PstI site of the pUC9 vector. One clone of 2.0-kb contained part of the poly(A) tail and was sequenced in its entirety using the chemical method of Maxam and Gilbert. Another clone of 0.7 kb also contained part of the poly(A) tail and was sequenced in part to confirm the primary structure of the most 3′ end of the genome. Two potential, nonoverlapping genes were identified within the 3′-terminal 1663-base sequence from an examination of open reading frames. The first gene encodes a 382-amino acid protein of 43,426 mol wt, that is the apparent nucleocapsid protein on the basis of size, chemical properties, and amino acid sequence homology with other coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins. It is flanked on its 5′ side by at least part of the matrix protein gene. The second encodes a hypothetical 78-amino acid protein of 9101 mol wt that is hydrophobic at both ends. A 3′-proximal noncoding sequence of 276 bases was also determined and a conserved stretch of 9 nucleotides near the poly(A) tail was found to be common among TGEV, the mouse hepatitis coronavirus, and the avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus.",1
"Our previous experiments showed that a variant virus with a larger envelope glycoprotein encoded by a larger mRNA3 (cl-2) multiplied predominantly in the brain of rats after wild type (wt) JHMV infection (F. Taguchi, S. Siddell, H. Wege, and V. ter Meulen, 1985, J. Virol., 54, 429–435). We could isolate similar but not identical variant virus after infection of cultured neural cells from rat brain with wt JHMV (designated CNS virus), which also had a larger mRNA3 and produced larger envelope E2 glycoprotein in infected cells. CNS virus multiplied to a higher degree in cultured astrocytes from rat than wt JHMV and cl-2. During infection with these variant viruses in neural cells, virus populations generated did not change, in contrast to consistent selection of viruses with larger mRNA3 after wt JHMV infections. CNS virus produced abundant mRNA2a as well as 65K glycoprotein while the productions of both were trace in cl-2 infected cells. The present experiments, together with our previous observation, suggest that the larger E2 glycoprotein may be of importance for the replication in rat brain cells.",1
"RNA-binding proteins of coronavirus MHV-A59 were identified using an RNA overlay-protein blot assay (ROPBA). The major viral RNA-binding protein in virions and infected cells was the phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein N (50K). A new 140K virus structural protein was identified as a minor RNA-binding protein both in virions and in infected cells. The 140K protein was antigenically related to N, and upon reduction, yielded only 50K N. Thus, the 140K protein is probably a trimer of N subunits linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds. Several cellular RNA-binding proteins were also detected. RNA-binding of N was not nucleotide sequence specific. Single-stranded RNA of MHV, VSV, or cellular origin, a DNA probe of the MHV leader sequence, and double-stranded bovine rotavirus RNA could all bind to N. Binding of MHV RNA was optimal between pH 7 and 8, and the RNA could be eluted in 0.1 M NaCl. The ROPBA is a useful method for the initial identification of RNA-binding proteins, such as N and the 140K protein of murine coronavirus.",1
"Monoclonal antibodies to the Quebec isolate of bovine coronavirus were produced and characterized. Monoclonal antibodies to both the E2 and the E3 glycoproteins were found to efficiently neutralize virus in vitro. None of the monoclonal antibodies directed against the E1 glycoprotein neutralized virus infectivity. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to the E2 glycoprotein were all found to immunoprecipitate gpl90, gpl00, and their intracellular precursor protein gp170. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to the E3 glycoprotein immunoprecipitated gp124 and showed differential reactivity to its precursor proteins gp59 and gpl 18. These monoclonal antibodies also showed differential reactivity to an apparent degradation product of E3. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to E2 bound to two distinct nonoverlappig antigenic domains as defined by competitive binding assays. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to the E3 glycoprotein also bound to two distinct antigenic sites as defined by competitive binding assays plus a third site which overlapped these regions. Other results indicated that one domain on the E3 glycoprotein could be further subdivided into two epitopes. Thus four epitopes could be defined by E3-specific monoclonal antibodies.",1
"The Lansing strain of poliovirus type 2 is a mouse-adapted virus that induces a fatal paralytic disease in mice after intracerebral inoculation. Our previous results indicated that the mouse-adapted phenotype maps to the Lansing viral capsid. To further define regions of the capsid that are specifically involved in the infection of mice, antigenic variants resistant to neutralization with monoclonal antibodies were selected, and their mouse neurovirulence was studied. The monoclonal antibodies used were directed against antigenic site 1, an immunodominant loop of capsid polypeptide VP1 located on the virion surface. Ten of twenty-two variants selected had lower intracerebral neurovirulence in mice when compared to the parental virus. Four of the ten antigenic variants with reduced neurovirulence were temperature sensitive (ts) for replication in HeLa cells, while the remaining six variants replicated in HeLa cells as well as the parent virus. Two ts+ variants that were studied had a reduced ability to replicate in the mouse brain. There was no difference in the histopathology and pattern of involvement in the central nervous system of one variant compared to the parent virus. In three variants, reduction of neurovirulence correlated with specific amino acid substitutions at positions 100 and 101 of VP1, located within antigenic site 1. The is phenotype in three variants was associated with a single amino acid deletion at position 105. Virus recovered from the brain of paralyzed mice that had been inoculated with the antigenic variants was characterized to identify the virus causing disease. In most cases, brain isolates resembled the inoculated virus in neurovirulence and amino acid sequence at the antigenic site. Virus recovered from brains of paralyzed mice that had been inoculated with the is variants was either ts+ or cold sensitive, and had become more neurovirulent. These results suggest that specific amino acid changes within an antigenic site on the virion surface may result in reduction of mouse neurovirulence without affecting viral replication in cultured cells",1
"The nucleotide sequence of the peplomer (E2) gene of MHV-A59 was determined from a set of overlapping cDNA clones. The E2 gene encodes a protein of 1324 amino acids including a hydrophobic signal peptide. A second large hydrophobic domain is found near the COOH terminus and probably represents the membrane anchor. Twenty glycosylation sites are predicted. Cleavage of the E2 protein results in two different 90K species, 90A and 90B (L. S. Sturman, C. S. Ricard, and K. V. Holmes (1985) J. Virol. 56, 904–911), and activates cell fusion. Protein sequencing of the trypsin-generated N-terminus revealed the position of the cleavage site. 90A and 90B could be identified as the C-terminal and the N-terminal parts, respectively. Amino acid sequence comparison of the A59 and 1HM E2 proteins showed extensive homology and revealed a stretch of 89 amino acids in the 90B region of the A59 E2 protein that is absent in JHM.",1
"Sixteen monoclonal antibodies (Mcabs) were prepared against infectious bronchitis virus strain M41, all of them reacting with the peplomer protein. One of them, Mcab 13, was able to neutralize the virus and to inhibit hemagglutination. Competition binding assays allowed the definition of five epitopes, designated as A, B, C, D, and E, of which epitopes A and B are overlapping. Furthermore, the binding of Mcab 13 (epitope E) could be enhanced by the addition of Mcabs from group B, C, and D. A dot immunoblot assay was used to analyze the effect of denaturation on antibody recognition of the epitopes. Only the binding of Mcab 13 was affected, indicating that the epitope involved in neutralization and hemagglutination is conformation dependent. The epitopes A to D were highly conserved among IBV strains, while epitope E was specific for strains M41 and D3896. In this last strain, however, this epitope was not involved in neutralization.",1
"The roles of glucose and mannose trimming in the maturation of Sindbis virus in BHK cells have been investigated using inhibitors of glycoprotein oligosaccharide processing. In the presence of the glucosidase inhibitor N-methyl-1-deoxynojirimycin the viral glycoproteins were equipped with oligosaccharides of the composition GIc3Man8,9(GIcNAc)2 and the yield of virus in the extracellular medium was reduced as a result of a block in the proteolytic cleavage of the precursor (pE2) of the E2 viral envelope glycoprotein. The mannosidase I inhibitor 1-deoxymannojirimycin (dMM) also inhibited the appearance of virus in the medium and the oligosaccharides on the viral glycoproteins had the composition Man9(GIcNAc)2. However, pE2 was cleaved to E2 under these conditions, and it was found that when the yield of virus from the cells and medium together was considered, there was no difference between untreated and dMM-treated cultures, suggesting the presence of intracellular virus particles in the dMM-treated cultures. When examined by electron microscopy, the dMM-treated cultures were found to contain intracellular virus particles. In addition, nucleocapsids were found lining intracellular membranes. These observations taken together with the plaque test data intimate that Sindbis virus preferentially buds from internal membranes in BHK cells treated with dMM. The results confirm the essential role of glucose trimming in the Sindbis virus-BHK cell system and suggest that the initial stages of mannose removal maybe important too.",1
"RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) activity was characterized in a cytoplasmic extract of Kunjin virus-infected Vero cells at 24 hr. The activity was influenced, possibly indirectly, by the length of prior treatment of infected cells with actinomycin D; however, 6 μg/ml actinomycin D and 10−5 M α-amanitin in the RDRP assay had no effect. The replication complex was membrane-bound and Mg2+ was essential for RDRP activity. Incorporation was more dependent on exogenous UTP and GTP than ATP or CTP. The specific activity was low, and rate of incorporation of GMP decreased as the period of assay was increased; however, incorporation of label lasted for at least 60 min. RNA products were fractionated by LiCl precipitation, and kinetic studies showed that the sequence of accumulation of label was the same as that observed in vivo, viz., RI → RF → 44 S RNA; limited reinitiation was also observed. This sequence of labeling also indicated that the in vitro RDRP activity was due to an enzyme capable of elongation, release, and reinitiation of Kunjin RNA synthesis and not merely end labeling or elongating preexisting RNA molecules. No labeled bands in urea-polyacrylamide gels were observed using extracts from mock-infected cells and hence the three RNA products of assays were readily identified in a single gel. The replication complex was still active after treatment with nonionic detergent, but no labeled 44 S RNA was detected in gels, even in the presence of RNasin in the assay which inhibited some nuclease activity. Antibodies to flavivirus-specific nonstructural proteins were preincubated with infected cell extracts in the presence and absence of detergent but no inhibition of RDRP activity was observed. However, anti-dsRNA plus detergent blocked activity by as much as 78% and label was found only in RF.",1
"The complete nucleotide sequence of nonstructural gene 5 of coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A59 has been determined. This sequence contains two potential open reading frames which overlap by five nucleotides. The putative protein products predicted from the sequence are a basic 13,000-Da polypeptide and a 9600-Da polypeptide containing an unusually long hydrophobic amino terminus. RNAs transcribed in vitro from DNAs containing each of the open reading frames in pGEM vectors direct the synthesis in vitro of polypeptides of the sizes predicted by the sequence. An RNA transcript containing both of the open reading frames directs the synthesis primarily of the polypeptide corresponding to the downstream open reading frame. These data suggest that MHV-A59 messenger RNA 5 potentially encodes two proteins and may be preferentially translated from an internal AUG initiation codon.",1
"The virion RNA of mouse hepatitis virus, strain A59 (MHV-A59) is believed to be the mRNA for the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The cell-free translation of virion RNA results in the synthesis of two predominant products p220 and p28 (M. R. Denison and S. Perlman, 1986, J. Virol. 60, 12–18). p28 is a basic protein and is readily detected by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. When infected cells and isolated virions were assayed for this protein by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, p28 could be detected in infected cells labeled at late times after infection, but not at early times or in purified virions. p28 represents the first protein product of the putative coronavirus polymerase gene to be identified in infected cells.",1
"The 3′ end of the 20-kb genome of the Mebus strain of bovine enteric coronavirus (BCV) was copied into cDNA and cloned into the PstI site of the pUC9 vector. Four clones from the 3′ end of the genome were sequenced either completely or in part to determine the sequence of the first 2451 bases. Within this sequence were identified, in order, a 3′-noncoding region of 291 bases, the gene for a 448-amino acid nucleocapsid protein (N) having a molecular weight of 49,379, and the gene for a 230-amino acid matrix protein (M) having a molecular weight of 26,376. A third large open reading frame is contained entirely within the N gene sequence but is positioned in a different reading frame; it potentially encodes a polypeptide of 207 amino acids having a molecular weight of 23,057. A higher degree of amino acid sequence homology was found between the M proteins of BCV and MHV (87%) than between the N proteins (70%). For the M proteins of BCV and MHV, notable differences were found at the amino terminus, the most probable site of O-glycosylation, where the sequence is N-Met-Ser-Ser-Val-Thr-Thr for BCV and N-Met-Ser-Ser-Thr-Thr for MHV. BCV apparently uses two of its six potential O-glycosylation sites.",1
"The coronavirus leader-primed transcription model proposes that free leader RNA species derived from the 5′-end of the genomic RNA are utilized as a primer for the transcription of subgenomic mRNAs. To elucidate the precise mechanism of leader-priming, we cloned and sequenced the 5′-end of the mouse hepatitis virus genomic RNA. The 5′-terminal sequences are identical to the leader sequences present at the 5′-end of the subgenomic mRNAs. Two possible hairpin loop structures and an AU-rich region around the 3′-end of the leader sequence may provide the termination site for leader RNA synthesis. The comparison of 5′-end genomic sequences and the intergenic start sites for mRNA transcription revealed that there are homologous regions of 7–18 nucleotides at the putative leader/body junction sites. Some intergenic regions contain a mismatching nucleotide within this homologous region. We propose that free leader RNA binds to the intergenic region due to this homology and is cleaved at the mismatching nucleotide before serving as a primer. Thus, the free leader RNA species may be longer than the leader sequences in the subgenomic mRNAs and different mRNAs may have different leader/body junction sites.",1
"Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a murine coronavinus, contains a nonsegmented RNA genome. We have previously shown that MHV could undergo RNA-RNA recombination in crosses between temperature-sensitive mutants and wild-type viruses at a very high frequency (S. Makino, J. G. Keck, S. A. Stohlman, and M. M. C. Lai (1986) J. Virol. 57, 729–737). To better define the mechanism of RNA recombination, we have performed additional crosses involving different sets of MHV strains. Three or possibly four classes of recombinants were isolated. Recombinants in the first class, which are similar to the ones previously reported, contain a single crossover in either gene A or B, which are the 5′-most genes. The second class of recombinants contain double crossovers in gene A. The third class of recombinants have crossovers within the leader sequence located at the 5′-end of the genome. The crossover sites of the third class have been located between 35 and 60 nucleotides from the 5′-end of the leader RNA. One of these recombinants has double crossovers within the short region comprising the leader sequences. Finally, we describe one recombinant which may contain a triple crossover. The presence of so many recombination sites within the 5′-end of the genome of murine coronaviruses confirms that RNA recombination is a frequent event during MHV replication and is consistent with our proposed model of “copy-choice” recombination in which RNA replication occurs in a discontinuous and nonprocessive manner.",1
"We have previously shown the presence of multiple small leader-containing RNA species in mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-infected cells. In this paper, we have analyzed the origin, structure, and mechanism of synthesis of these small RNAs. Using cDNA probes specific for leader RNA and genes A, D, and F, we demonstrate that subsets of these small RNAs were derived from the various viral genes. These subsets have discrete and reproducible sizes, varying with the gene from which they are derived. The size of each subset correlates with regions of secondary structure, whose free energy ranges from −1.6 to −77.1 kcal/mol, in each of the mRNAs examined. In addition, identical subsets were detected on the replicative intermediate (RI) RNA, suggesting that they represent functional transcriptional intermediates. The biological significance of these small RNAs is further supported by the detection of leader-containing RNAs of 47, 50, and 57 nucleotides in length, which correspond to the crossover sites in two MHV recombinant viruses. These data, coupled with the high frequency of RNA recombination during MHV infection, suggest that the viral polymerase may pause in or around regions of secondary structure, thereby generating pools of free leader-containing RNA intermediates which can reassociate with the template, acting as primers for the synthesis of full-length or recombinant RNAs. These data suggest that MHV transcription uses a discontinuous and nonprocessive mechanism in which RNA polymerase allows the partial RNA products to be dissociated from the template temporarily during the process of transcription.",1
"The Punta Toro virus (PTV) middle size (M) RNA encodes two glycoproteins, G1 and G2, and possibly a nonstructural protein, NSM. A partial cDNA clone of the M segment which contains G1 and G2 glycoprotein coding sequences but lacks most of the NSM sequences was inserted into the genome of vaccinia virus under the control of an early vaccinia promoter. Cells infected with the recombinant virus were found to synthesize two polypeptides with molecular weights of 65,000 (G1) and 55,000 (G2) that reacted specifically with antibody against PTV. Studies using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that these proteins accumulated intracellularly in the perinuclear region. The results of endoglycosidase H digestion of these glycoproteins suggested that both G1 and G2 glycoproteins were transported from the RER to the Golgi complex. These proteins were not chased out from the Golgi region during a 6-hr incubation in the presence of cycloheximide. Surface immune precipitation and 125I-protein A binding assays also demonstrated that the majority of the G1 and G2 glycoproteins are retained intracellularly. These results indicate that the PTV glycoproteins contain the necessary information for retention in the Golgi apparatus.",1
"The genetic information, carried on mRNA 6 of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) strain 79–1146, was determined by sequence analysis of cDNA clones derived from the 3′ end of the FIPV genome. Two ORFs were found, encoding polypeptides of 11 K (ORF-1) and 22K (ORF-2). The FIPV sequence was compared to the 3′ end sequence of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). ORF-1 has a homologous counterpart (ORF-X3) in the TGEV genome; both ORFs are located at the same position relative to the nucleocapsid gene. However, as a result of an in-frame insertion or deletion, ORF-1 is 69 nucleotides larger than ORF-X3. A similar event has occurred immediately downstream of ORF1: a 624-nucleotide segment, containing the complete ORF-2, is absent in the TGEV sequence. Most sequence similarity (98.5%) was found in the 3′ noncoding sequences. ORF-X3 and ORF-1 are preceded by the sequence AAC-TAAAC, which is assumed to be the transcription-initiation signal in FIPV and TGEV (P. A. Kapke and D. A. Brian (1986) Virology 151, 41–49). By S1 nuclease analysis, the 5′ end of FIPV RNA 6 was mapped immediately upstream of this sequence. A 700-nucleotide TGEV-specific RNA was found by cross-hybridization with an FIPV 3′ end probe, suggesting that TGEV ORF-X3 is also carried on a separate mRNA. The differences at the 3′ ends of the FIPV and TGEV genomes maybe the result of RNA recombination events.",1
"We have developed a permeabilized cell system for assaying mouse hepatitis virus-specific RNA polymerase activity. This activity was characterized as to its requirements for mono- and divalent cations, requirements for an exogenous energy source, and pH optimum. This system faithfully reflects MHV-specific RNA synthesis in the intact cell, with regard to both its time of appearance during the course of infection and the products synthesized. The system is efficient and the RNA products were identical to those observed in intact MHV-infected cells as judged by agarose gel electrophoresis and hybridization. Permeabilized cells appear to be an ideal system for studying coronavirus RNA synthesis since they closely mimic in vivo conditions while allowing much of the experimental flexibility of truly cell-free systems.",1
"The mechanism of synthesis of the defective viral RNAs in cells infected with defective-interfering (DI) particles of mouse hepatitis virus was studied. Two DI-specific RNA species, DIssA of genomic size and DIssE of subgenomic size, were detected in DI-infected cells. Purified DI particles, however, were found to contain predominantly DIssA and only a trace amount of DIssE RNA. Despite its negligible amount, the DIssE RNA in virions appears to serve as the template for the synthesis of DIssE RNA in infected cells. This conclusion was supported by two studies. First, the uv target size for DIssE RNA synthesis is significantly smaller than that for DIssA. Second, when purified DIssE RNA was transfected into cells which had been infected with a helper virus, DIssE RNA could replicate itself and became a predominant RNA species in the infected cells. Thus, DIssE RNA was not synthesized from the genomic RNA of DI particles. By studying the relationship between virus dilution and the amount of intracellular viral RNA synthesis, we have further shown that DIssE RNA synthesis requires a helper function, but it does not utilize the leader sequence of the helper virus. In contrast, DIssA synthesis appears to be helper-independent and can replicate itself. Thus DIssA codes for a functional RNA polymerase.",1
"Mouse thymic virus (MTLV; murid herpesvirus 3) is a lymphotropic herpesvirus that cytolytically infects developing T lineage lymphocytes in the thymus of neonatal mice. MTLV establishes a persistent infection and can be recovered indefinitely from infected mice, but nothing is known about requirements for this persistent infection. In order to determine whether T lineage lymphocytes are required for infection, young adult athymic nude (nulnu) mice and euthymic littermates were infected with MTLV and tested for virus shedding. Although euthymic littermates regularly shed virus, in the nude mice only about 20% of isolation attempts up to 100 days postinfection were positive. Blind passage yielded an additional three isolations out of 14 samples (21 %). In addition, unlike many other herpesviruses, the virus did not replicate in a number of epithelial and fibroblastic cell lines that were tested. These data confirm that the virus is preferentially T lymphotropic and suggest that infection may require T lineage lymphocytes.",1
"Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection of the L-2 subline of mouse fibroblasts results in acute infection characterized by extensive cell fusion. In contrast, infection of the LM-K subline leads to virus persistence with reduced cell fusion. We undertook studies designed to elucidate the role of host cell membrane lipid composition and the cytoskeleton in modulating the fusion process and the resultant effect(s) on virus persistence. MHV-induced cell fusion proceeded normally in cells treated with cytoskeleton-disrupting drugs, cytochalasin B and colchicine. Modification of cell membrane fatty acid composition by supplementation of LM-K cells with arachidonic (C-20:4) or palmitic (C-16:0) acids had little effect on the extent of MHV-induced cell fusion or on virus replication. However, supplementation of both cell types with cholesterol (resulting in increased membrane cholesterol/fatty acid ratio) resulted in marked enhancement of virus-mediated cell fusion. The increase in cell membrane cholesterol did not enhance internalization of MHV suggesting that cholesterol primarily modulates a later event. This suggestion was confirmed by demonstrating cholesterol-enhancement of fusion in a contact fusion assay. Cholesterol-supplemented L-2 cells were less productive for virus replication than unsupplemented cells, in agreement with our previous observations that MHV replication is compromised by extensive cytopathic effect. Although cholesterol-supplemented LM-K cells showed increased susceptibility to MHV-mediated cell fusion, the extent of such susceptibility did not approach that observed in L-2 cells. Also, the property of LM-K cells to support MHV persistence was not abolished by cholesterol supplementation. Thus membrane fusion resistance and MHV persistence are modulated but not alleviated by cell membrane cholesterol content.",1
"Suckling C57BU6 mice infected with mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM (MHV-JHM) develop either a fatal acute encephalomyelitis or a late onset demyelinating disease, depending on whether they are nursed by unimmunized or immunized dams. To determine the localization of virus-specific RNA, serial sections of brains from infected and uninfected mice were annealed with a 35S-labeled antisense RNA probe and analyzed by film autoradiography. In the mice with acute encephalomyelitis, viral RNA was present in the mesencephalon, hypothalamus, hippocampus, basal ganglia, subcortical white matter, and thalamus. Viral RNA was detected in the spinal cords of all mice with the late onset, demyelinating encephalomyelitis, but was distributed into three different patterns in the brains of these mice, even though all had the same clinical disease. In the first group, viral RNA was detected only in the brainstem. In the second group, viral RNA was detected in the brainstem, thalamus, and cerebral grey matter. This distribution was consistent with viral spread along well-defined tracts connecting these parts of the brain. In the third group, viral RNA could be detected both in the brainstem and in several white matter tracts within close physical proximity to the optic chiasm. This distribution was consistent with viral spread by an extracellular route from one white matter tract to other tracts which were physically close, but which were not part of the same pathways. These results suggest that MHV-JHM spreads through the central nervous system both along well-defined neuronal pathways and by spread from contiguous structures, but also suggest that viral replicates preferentially in a limited number of areas of the brain. The technique of in situ hybridization with film autoradiography should be generally useful for analyzing macroscopic movements of virus within infected organs.",1
The nucleotide sequence of the unique region of coronavirus MHV-A59 mRNA 2 has been determined. Two open reading frames (ORF) are predicted: ORF1 potentially encodes a protein of 261 amino acids; its amino acid sequence contains elements which indicate nucleotide binding properties. ORF2 predicts a 413 amino acids protein; it lacks a translation initiation codon and is therefore probably a pseudogene. The amino acid sequence of ORF2 shares 30% homology with the HA1 hemagglutinin sequence of influenza C virus. A short stretch of nucleotides immediately upstream of ORF2 shares 83% homology with the MHC class I nucleotide sequences. We discuss the possibilitythat both similarities are the result of recombinations and present a model for the acquisition and the subsequent inactivation of ORF2; the model applies also to MHV-A59-related coronaviruses in which we expect ORF2 to be still functional.,1
"An intracellular defective-interfering (DI) RNA, DIssE, of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) obtained after serial high multiplicity passage of the virus was cloned and sequenced. DIssE RNA is composed of three noncontiguous genomic regions, representing the first 864 nucleotides of the Fend, an internal 748 nucleotides of the polymerase gene, and 601 nucleotides from the 3′ end of the parental MHV genome. The DIssE sequence contains one large continuous open reading frame. Two protein products from this open reading frame were identified both by in vitro translation and in DI-infected cells. Sequence comparison of DIssE and the corresponding parts of the parental virus genome revealed that DIssE had three base substitutions within the leader sequence and also a deletion of nine nucleotides located at the junction of the leader and the remaining genomic sequence. The 5′ end of DIssE RNA was heterogeneous with respect to the number of UCUAA repeats within the leader sequence. The parental MHV genomic RNA appears to have extensive and stable secondary structures at the regions where DI RNA rearrangements occurred. These data suggest that MHV DI RNA may have been generated as a result of the discontinuous and nonprocessive manner of MHV RNA synthesis.",1
"The contribution of oligosaccharides to the structural and functional make-up of respiratory syncytial (RS) virus G and F proteins was investigated by observing the effects of various oligosaccharide-specific enzymes on their molecular size as well as on virus infectivity. The N-linked oligosaccharides of the F protein were completely removed by endoglycosidase F and N-glycanase. Addition of oligosaccharides to F protein during synthesis was completely partially resistant to TM resulting in an 80-kDa form designated GTM. The G protein was estimated to contain approximately 3% N-linked and 55% O-linked carbohydrates, based on migration of G and GTM in polyacrylamide gels. Furthermore, treatment of detergent-extracted G protein with endoglycosidase F and endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, enzymes that specifically cleave N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharides, respectively, generated a variety of partially unglycosylated species, ranging in molecular weight from approximately 80 to 40 kDa. Virus infectivity was sensitive to limited removal of N-linked or O-linked oligosaccharides by endoglycosidases under conditions which did not greatly alter the molecular weight of the G protein. Thus, G and F protein oligosaccharides readily accessible to enzymatic removal are presumed to play an important role in the infectious process.",1
"cDNA clones mapping within the first 2601 bases of the 3′ end of the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) genome were sequenced by the method of Maxam and Gilbert and an open reading frame yielding a protein having properties of the matrix (M or E1) protein was identified. It is positioned at the 5′ side of the nucleocapsid (N) gene from which it is separated by an intergenic stretch of 12 bases. The deduced M protein comprises 262 amino acids, has a molecular weight of 29,544, is moderately hydrophobic, and has a net charge of +7 at neutral pH. Thirty-four percent of its amino acid sequence is homologous with the M protein of the bovine coronavirus (BCV), 32% with that of the mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV), and 19% with that of the avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV). Judging from alignment with the BCV, MHV, and IBV M proteins, the amino terminus of the TGEV M protein extends 54 amino acids from the virion envelope which compares with only 28 for BCV, 26 for MHV, and 21 for IBV. Eleven of the sixteen amino-terminal amino acids are hydrophobic and the positions of charged amino acids around this sequence suggest that the first 16 amino acids comprise a potentially cleavable signal peptide for membrane insertion. A similar sequence is not found in the M proteins of BCV, MHV, or IBV. When mRNA from infected cells, or RNA prepared by in vitro transcription of the reconstructed M gene, was translated in vitro in the presence of microsomes, the M protein became translocated and glycosylated. When a protein without the amino-terminal signal peptide was made by translating a truncated version of the M gene transcript, some translocation and glycosylation also occurred suggesting that the amino-terminal signal peptide on the TGEV M protein is not an absolute requirement for membrane translocation. Interestingly, the amino-terminal peptide did not appear to be cleaved during in vitro translation in the presence of microsomes suggesting that a step in virion assembly may be required for proper exposure of the cleavage site to the signal peptidase.",1
"Defective viral particles containing deleted genomes were detected in harvests of cell cultures infected with various HAV isolates. The most prominent deletions were identified within the region of the genome coding for structural proteins. In this location three different deletions spanning nts 930–4380 (A), 1140–3820 (B), and 1370–3240 (C) were characterized. In addition to these internal deletions, various truncated RNAs were detected lacking either partially or completely the 3′ terminal region which is supposed to code for viral replicase. RNA molecules with internal deletions as well as those with 3′ terminal truncations could also be extracted directly from infected cells. During multiple consecutive passages of a given HAV strain, deletions A, B, and C accumulated and a quantitative increase of deleted RNAs occurred. Type and predominance of deletions varied with virus strains (CLF, GBM, MBB11/5, HM175, CR326, H141) and with the type of cells used for propagation (MRC-5, BGM, HELF, PLC/PRF/5). However, within the limits of the reliability of S1 analysis the endpoints of deletions A, B, and C were conserved. The mechanisms leading to formation of deletions remain unclear. Yet, some sequences flanking internal deletions showed homology with common splice signals and 3′ terminal truncations proved to be confined to a distinct region within the genome.",1
"Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) gene 5 contains two open reading frames. We have expressed the second open reading frame of this gene (gene 5 ORF 2) in an Escherichia coli expression system. This system utilized a plasmid which contained the promoter and the first 36 codons of the recA gene fused in frame with the MHV gene 5 ORF 2, which is fused in turn to the β-galactosidase gene. The protein product of this gene fusion was used to raise antibody to gene 5 ORF 2. The specificity of the antibody was verified by immunoprecipitation of the in vitro transcribed and translated protein product of gene 5 ORF 2. The second reading frame of MHV gene 5 was shown to be expressed during the course of infection by immunocytochemistry and radioimmunoprecipitation using the antibody raised against the E. coli fusion protein and by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.",1
"Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) can cause neurological disease when inoculated intracerebrally (ic) into mice and rats. Specifically the JHM strain of MHV (MHV-JHM) generally causes an acute encephalitis when inoculated is into 2-day-old Wistar Furth rats. In contrast, JHM generally produces a chronic demyelinating disease with resulting posterior paralysis when inoculated is into 10-day-old Wistar Furth rats. In addition, while JHM readily produces a productive infection in a mouse fibroblast cell line (L-2), it does not form syncytia or replicate well in a tissue cell line of glial origin (G26-24). We have isolated and characterized three MHV-JHM viral variants from the central nervous system of two Wistar Furth rats with a MHV-JHM-induced demyelinating disease. The pattern of viral-specific mRNA for all three of these variants differed from what was observed for the wild-type parental MHV-JHM that had been passaged only in tissue culture. One of these variants, ATIIf cord virus, which induced a chronic demyelinating disease in 2- or 10-day-old intracerebrally inoculated Wistar Furth rats, had a deletion in the coding region of the peplomer glycoprotein mRNA. In addition, this variant formed massive syncytia and replicated well in G26-24 cells. We have not detected this deletion in the other two JHM variants, ATIIf brain virus and ATIIe brain virus. ATIIf brain virus and ATIIe brain virus primarily produced an acute encephalitis when reinoculated into 2-or 10-day-old Wistar Furth rats. In addition, these two variants did not form syncytia and had a reduced ability to replicate in G26-24 cells.",1
"Human coronaviruses are important human pathogens and have also been implicated in multiple sclerosis. To further understand the molecular biology of human coronavirus 229E (HCV-229E), molecular cloning and sequence analysis of the viral RNA have been initiated. Following established protocols, the 3′-terminal 1732 nucleotides of the genome were sequenced. A large open reading frame encodes a 389 amino acid protein of 43,366 Da, which is presumably the nucleocapsid protein. The predicted protein is similar in size, chemical properties, and amino acid sequence to the nucleocapsid proteins of other coronaviruses. This is especially evident when the sequence is compared with that of the antigenically related porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), with which a region of 46% amino acid sequence homology was found. Hydropathy profiles revealed the existence of several conserved domains which could have functional significance. An intergenic consensus sequence precedes the 5′-end of the proposed nucleocapsid protein gene. The consensus sequence is present in other coronaviruses and has been proposed as the site of binding of the leader sequence for mRNA transcriptional start. This region was also examined by primer extension analysis of mRNAs, which identified a 60-nucleotide leader sequence. The 3′-noncoding region of the genome contains an 11-nucleotide sequence, which is relatively conserved throughout the Coronavirus family and lends support to the theory that this region is important for the replication of negative-strand RNA.",1
"The sequences of the peplomeric S1 protein of four serologically distinct strains of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), an avian coronavirus, have been determined. The S1 protein is thought to contain the serotype-specific neutralization epitopes and to be the main target of antigenic variation. An alignment with sequences of three strains published previously showed that from the 545 amino acid residues only 243 have been conserved. Clustering of substitutions suggests that most serotype determinants are located within the first 300 amino acid residues of S1. A phylogenetic tree of the S1 sequences showed very variable rates of divergence. Differences in topology with a tree based on RNAse-T1 fingerprint data indicate that some of the IBV strains have arisen by genetic recombination.",1
"The 5′-ends of the genomic RNA and subgenomic mRNAs of murine coronavirus (MHV) have a stretch of approximately 70 nucleotides of leader sequences. The 3'-region of this leader sequence contains several repeats of a pentanucleotide (UCUAA), whose number varies among different MHV strains. It has been demonstrated that this UCUAA repeat plays crucial roles in the discontinuous transcription of MHV mRNAs. In the present study, we demonstrate that the number of UCUAA repeats in the leader sequence of MHV genome rapidly decreases during serial passages of viruses on susceptible cells. The downward evolution of the number of UCUAA repeats was not due to a higher growth rate of the viruses with fewer repeats, but seemed to be due to homologous interference between viruses with different numbers of UCUAA repeat. The ease with which these variant viruses arose suggests the high frequency of the occurrence of this deletion during RNA replication. This finding is in agreement with the proposed discontinuous and nonprocessive mode of coronavirus RNA synthesis. Analysis of the intracellular subgenomic mRNA species of viruses with different numbers of UCUAA repeats and of MHV recombinant viruses suggests that the number of this pentanucleotide repeat at the 3′-end of the leader sequence may regulate the synthesis of certain mRNA species, in agreement with the leader-primed transcription mechanism.",1
"We have examined six different JHMV variants, sp-4 (recloned wt JHMV), cl-2, CNSV, DL, DS, and JHM-X, in terms of the sizes of the mRNA3 and E2 glycoprotein as well as their reactivity to a panel of monoclonal antibodies to the E2 glycoprotein. Two of these variants, sp-4 and JHM-X, were found to have smaller mRNA3 and E2 glycoprotein species compared with those of the other four variants. In addition, sp-4 and JHM-X were distinguished from the other four variants by their inability to bind to monoclonal antibodies recognizing two antigenic domains of the E2 molecule. Thus, six JHMV variants could clearly be divided into two groups with respect to the size and antigenicity of their E2 glycoproteins.",1
"The Japanese encephalitis virus (JE) structural glycoprotein (E) and two nonstructural glycoproteins (NS1 and NS1′) were processed differently by JE-infected vertebrate and invertebrate cell lines. All three proteins were released slowly (t 1 2 > 6 hr) from JE-infected monkey cells (Vero cells). Mosquito cell lines released E at a similar rate (t 1 2 > 8 hr), while NS1 and NS1′ were retained in an undegraded form in the cell layer. The proteolytic processing of the three proteins appeared identical in both cell types, but some differences in Winked glycosylation were observed. E, NS1, and NS1′ found within the infected cells of both types contained high-mannose oligosaccharide groups for more than 8 hr after synthesis. Additional sugar residues were added to the single E protein oligosaccharide group prior to release from Vero cells, while sugar residues were trimmed from the E protein oligosaccharide group prior to release from mosquito cells. The forms of NS1 and NS1′ found in the culture fluid of infected Vero cells contained one complex and one high-mannose oligosaccharide. All three glycoproteins released from JE-infected Vero cells were associated with extracellular particles, the virion in the case of E and a low density particle in the case of NS1′ and NSV. Furthermore, E, NS1′ and NS1′ exhibited amphipathic properties in Triton X-114 extraction experiments. Taken together, these results suggest that both the structural (E) and nonstructural NS1′ and NSV) glycoproteins were accumulated within the secretory pathway of the infected Vero cells, assembled into particles, and then released into the extracellular fluid.",1
"Monoclonal antibodies to the matrix or El glycoprotein of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) were tested for their ability to protect mice from a normally lethal challenge of MHV-4. Four antibodies were tested, and two of these,J.1.3 and J.3.9, were protective. Protection did not correlate with virus neutralization in vitro, antibody isotype, recognition of a unique El antigenic site, or dependence on complement in vivo. Survival from acute encephalitis was followed by subacute demyelination, as has been shown with protection mediated by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against the major glycoprotein, E2. These results demonstrate that antibodies which are specific for a viral matrix protein are able to alter the course of disease.",1
"The route of entry into the central nervous system (CNS) of most neurotropic viruses has not been established. The coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM (MHV-JHM), causes acute encephalomyelitis and acute and chronic demyelinating diseases and is an important model system for virus-induced neurological disease. Suckling C578L/6 mice infected intranasally with MHV-JHM develop either the acute encephalomyelitis or a late onset, symptomatic demyelinating encephalomyelitis, depending on whether they are nursed by unimmunized or immunized dams. Analysis by in situ hybridization was used to determine the route of entry of MHV-JHM into the CNS in these mice. At early times, viral RNA was detected only in the trigeminal and olfactory nerves and in their immediate connections in all mice. A few days later, MHV-JHM RNA was found throughout the brain in mice dying of the acute encephalomyelitis, but remained confined to the entry sites in mice which did not develop acute disease. These results suggest that MHV-JHM enters the CNS via an interneuronal route in all mice, but that the presence of maternal antibody prevents the dissemination of virus via extracellular fluid. In addition, MHV-JHM may establish low-level persistence in the trigeminal or olfactory nerve or in one of its connections in mice that do not develop acute encephalomyelitis.",1
"The nucleotide sequence of the gene that encodes for the structural viral protein VP1 of bovine rotavirus (RF strain) has been determined. The sequence data indicate that segment 1 contains 3302 by and is A+T rich (65.3%). The positive strand of segment 1 contains a single open reading frame that extends 1088 codons and possesses 5′- and 3′-terminal untranslated regions of 18 and 20 bp, respectively. The first AUG conforms to the Kozak consensus sequence and if utilized, would yield a protein having a calculated molecular weight of 124–847, very close to the apparent molecular weight of VP1 (M.W. 125,000). The deduced amino acid sequence presents significant similarities with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of several RNA viruses. VP1 was also synthesized in baculovirus using two transfer vecors: pAC461 and pVL941. Following infection of Sf9 cells with a recombinant baculovirus, a full-length nonfusion protein was synthesised which shares properties with authentic VP1 made in monkey kidney cells. The level of VP1 synthesis was about 10-fold higher when the baculovirus recombinant was derived from the pVL941 transfer vector. In that case, VP1 was expressed in yields approximately equivalent to 10% of the cellular protein. The recombinant protein was immunoprecipitated by hyperimmune serum raised against purified rotavirus. It also was immunogenic; a hyperimmune serum made in guinea pigs reacted with VP1 using immunoprecipitation and Western blot. This serum did not possess neutralization activity.",1
"Complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries were constructed representing the genome RNA of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus, strain A59 (MHV-A59). From these libraries clones were selected to form a linear map across the entire gene A, the putative viral polymerase gene. This gene is approximately 23 kb in length, considerably larger than earlier estimates. Sequence analysis of the U terminal region of the genome indicates the presence of the 66-nucleotide leader that is found on all mRNAs. Secondary structure analysis of the 5′terminal region suggests that transcription of leader terminates in the region of nucleotide 66. The sequence of the first 2000 nucleotides is very similar to that reported for the closely related JHM strain of MHV and potentially encodes p28, a basic protein thought to be a component of the viral polymerase (L. Soe, C. K. Shieh, S. Baker, M. F. Chang, and M. M. C. Lai, 1987, J. Virol., 61, 3968–3976). Gene A contains two of the consensus sequences found in intergenic regions. One is adjacent to the 5′ leader sequence and the other is upstream from the initiation codon for translation of gene B.",1
"All three influenza virus polymerase (P) proteins were expressed in Xenopus oocytes from microinjected in vitro transcribed mRNA analogs, with yields of up to 100 ng per oocyte. To examine the functional state of the Xenopus-expressed P proteins, the polypeptides were tested for their ability to form stable complexes with each other. As seen in virus-infected cells, all three P proteins associated into an immunoprecipitable complex, suggesting that the system has considerable promise for the reconstruction of an active influenza RNA polymerase. Examination of the ability of paired combinations of the P proteins to associate indicated that PB1 contained independent binding sites for PB2 and PA, and so probably formed the backbone of the complex. Sedimentation analysis of free and complexed P proteins indicated that PB1 and PB2 did not exist as free monomers, and that similarly, complexes of all three P proteins did not simply consist of one copy of each protein. The heterodisperse sedimentation rate seen for complexes of all three P proteins did not appear to result from their binding to RNA, suggesting the incorporation of additional polypeptides polymerase complex.",1
"The gene encoding the E2 peplomer glycoprotein of coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus JHM strain (JHMV) has been inserted into the genome of Autographa cafifornica nuclear polyhedrosis baculovirus (AcNPV) in lieu of the coding region of the AcNPV polyhedrin gene. This recombinant virus produced E2 protein in insect cells under the control of the baculovirus polyhedrin promotor. The expressed E2 protein was shown in size and antigenic properties to be similar to the E2 protein produced in mouse cells infected by JHMV. The expressed E2 protein was glycosylated and transported to the cell surface; however, no proteolytic cleavage was detected in insect cells. The sera from rats immunized with partially purified E2 protein derived from insect cells reacted in immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence experiments with the E2 protein produced in JHMV-infected mouse cells. The antiserum failed to neutralize the infectivity of JHMV. These results suggest that the E2 protein expressed by the recombinant baculovirus in insect cells is similar but not identical to the E2 protein produced in JHMV-infected mouse cells. The inability of the E2 protein expressed in insect cells to produce neutralizing antibody is discussed.",1
"Direct RNA sequence analysis of the E2 gene of wild-type MHV-4 and of neutralization resistant, neuroattenuated variants has identified a polymorphic region with respect to deletions. These variants had large deletions of 142 to 159 amino acids mapping to a localized region in the amino-terminal domain of the peplomer glycoprotein. The nucleotide sequence of the E2 gene for wild-type strain MHV-4 was found to be very similar to that of MHV-JHM but had an insertion of 423 nucleotides resulting in the addition of a stretch of 141 unique amino acids in the amino-terminal domain of E2. We propose that deletions reflect a major source of heterogeneity in the E2 protein of MHV.",1
"We have previously shown that gp65 (E3) is a virion structural protein which varies widely in quantity among different strains of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). In this study, the biosynthetic pathway and possible biological activities of this protein were examined. The glycosylation of gp65 in virus-infected cells was inhibited by tunicamycin but not by monensin, suggesting that it contains an N-glycosidic linkage. Glycosylation is cotranslational and appears to be complete before the glycoprotein reaches the Golgi complex. Pulse-chase experiments showed that this protein decreased in size after 30 min of chase, suggesting that the carbohydrate chains of gp65 undergo trimming during its transport across the Golgi. This interpretation is supported by the endoglycosidase treatment of gp65, which showed that the peptide backbone of gp65 did not decrease in size after pulse-chase periods. This maturation pathway is distinct from that of the E1 or E2 glycoproteins. Partial endoglycosidase treatment indicated that gp65 contains 9 to 10 carbohydrate side chains; thus, almost all of the potential glycosylation sites of gp65 were glycosylated. In vitro translation studies coupled with protease digestion suggest that gp65 is an integral membrane protein. The presence of gp65 in the virion is correlated with the presence of an acetylesterase activity. No hemagglutinin activity was detected.",1
"Two virus-encoded proteinases are responsible for proteolysis of potyvirus polyproteins. One of these, HC-Pro, is a multifunctional protein that autolytically cleaves at its carboxyl-terminus (J. C. Carrington et al., 1989, EMBO J. 8, 365–370). To identify the class of proteinase to which HC-Pro belongs, tobacco etch virus (TEV) HC-Pro mutants containing single amino acid substitutions at serine, cysteine, aspartic acid, and histidine positions were synthesized by in vitro transcription and translation and were tested for autoproteolytic activity. Combinations of these residues are constituents of the active sites of diverse groups of cellular and viral proteinases. Only those positions that were strictly conserved among four potyvirus HC-Pro proteolytic domains (for which sequences have been deduced) were mutagenized. Of the 19 mutant proteinases synthesized and tested, only those with alterations at Cys-649 and His-722 were defective for HC-Pro autolytic activity. Most of the other mutant proteinases exhibited no impairments in processing kinetics experiments. The spectrum of essential residues, as defined by this genetic analysis, supports the hypothesis that HC-Pro most closely resembles members of the cysteine-type family of proteinases.",1
"An examination of the frameshift signals or proposed signals within published sequences of retroviruses and other genetic elements from higher animals shows that each site utilizes a tRNA which normally contains Wybutoxine (Wye) base or Queuine (Q) base in the anticodon loop. We find experimentally that most of the Phe-tRNA present in HIV-1 infected cells lacks the highly modified Wye base in its anticodon loop and most of the Asn-tRNA in HTLV-1 and BLV infected cells lacks the highly modified Q base in its anticodon loop. Interestingly, Phe-tRNA translates a UUU codon within the ribosomal frameshift signal in HIV and Asn-tRNA translates a AAC codon within the proposed frameshift signals in HTLV-1 and BLV. Thus, the lack of a highly modified base in the anticodon loop of tRNAs in retroviral infected cells is correlated with the participation of these undermodified tRNAs in the corresponding frameshift event. This suggests that the “shifty” tRNAs proposed by Jacks et al. (Cell 55, 447–458, 1988) to carry out frameshifting may be hypomodified isoacceptors.",1
"We have established bovine papilloma virus (BPV)-transformed mouse C127 cell lines that synthesize the peplomer protein of the feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) strain 79-1146. For this purpose, a new cassette expression vector pHSL, which carries the Drosophila HSp70 promotor and the polyadenylation signal of the Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat, was constructed. Cocultivation of the BPV-transformed cell lines with FIPV-permissive feline fcwf-D cells resulted in polykaryocyte formation. Since it depended on the presence of fcwf-D cells, binding of E2 to the cell receptor may be required for membrane fusion. E2 was synthesized as a core-glycosylated protein of 180K which was only slowly transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the medial Golgi: of the E2-molecules labeled during a 1-hr pulse about half was still completely sensitive to endoglycosidase H after a 2-hr chase, while the remaining E2 had been chased into multiple, partially endoglycosidase H-resistant forms. Immunofluorescence studies also indicated that most E2 was retained intracellularly. Mice immunized with whole lysates of the transformed cells produced FIPV-neutralizing antibodies as shown by plaque reduction.",1
"Measles virus (MV) replication in brain tissue of Lewis rats with acute (AE) and subacute (SAME) encephalitis was characterized by biochemical techniques. Messenger RNAs specific for measles virus nucleocapsid (N), phospho (P)-, matrix (M), fusion (F), and haemagglutinin (H) protein were detected in all brain extracts examined. The quantity of the individual MV mRNA species was quite different in comparison to lytically infected Vero cells. A steep gradient of MV transcripts was found in brain tissue which is most likely due to strongly attenuated transcription of mRNAs along the viral genome, representing particularly low transcription of the glycoprotein genes. In addition, in vitro translation assays only revealed synthesis of N and P protein in consistent fashion. The mRNAs for the glycoproteins did not direct the synthesis of detectable viral proteins whereas the M mRNA revealed some activity in animals with AE. The data indicate a strong restriction of the MV envelope gene expression in infected brain tissue, which is independent of the incubation time and type of the central nervous system (CNS) disease. This phenomenon which is similar to the findings observed in measles inclusion body encephalitis and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis suggest that host factors may initially be responsible for the initiation of transcriptional and translational alterations.",1
"Vaccinia virus-infected BSC 40 cells do not permit the replication of superinfecting vaccinia virus. The extent of superinfecting virus propagation depends on the time of superinfection; there is 90% exclusion by 4 hr after the initial infection, and more than 99% by 6 hr. When superinfection is attempted at 6 hr after infection, the superinfecting virus is incapable of carrying out DNA replication or early gene transcription, demonstrating that an early event in the virus life cycle is inhibited. The rate of adsorption of the superinfecting virus is unaltered which shows that exclusion is affected at a point between adsorption and early gene transcription. In order to exclude superinfection, the primary infecting virus does not require replication of its DNA or expression of its late genes but it must express one or more early genes.",1
"Murine hepatitis viruses provide excellent animal models for the study of virus-induced diseases of the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. Several studies have indirectly provided evidence that the spike glycoprotein (S) of these coronaviruses bears determinants for pathogenesis and the induction of protective immunity. In order to directly evaluate the immunogenicity of this protein, it was purified by affinity chromatography with an in vitro neutralizing and in vivo protective monoclonal antibody which immunoprecipitated the 180-kDa spike glycoprotein of the neurotropic A59 strain of murine hepatitis virus (MHV-A59). Mice immunized twice with approximately 1 μg of purified S in Freund's adjuvant developed high titers of neutralizing and fusion inhibiting antibodies, even though the protein was at least partially denaturated after elution from the affinity column. Moreover, these mice were protected from lethal encephalitis when challenged intracerebrally with 10 LD50 of MHV-A59. This study provides a direct demonstration of the importance of the coronavirus spike glycoprotein in the induction of a protective immune response.",1
"The antigenic homology of 26 coronavirus isolates, of which 22 were antigenically related to transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), was determined with 42 monoclonal antibodies. Type, group, and interspecies specific epitopes were defined. Two group specific MAbs distinguished the enteric TGEV isolates from the respiratory variants. An antigenic subsite involved in neutralization was conserved in porcine, feline, and canine coronavirus. The classification of the human coronavirus 229E in a taxonomic cluster distinct from TGEV group is suggested.",1
"A 266-bp fragment of cDNA from within gene B, ORF 2a, of MHV-A59 was used to construct a vector encoding a bacterial/viral fusion protein. Antiserum raised against this fusion protein specifically immunoprecipitates a 30K protein from infected 17CI-1 mouse fibroblasts. The protein is localized primarily in the cytosol and not in the membranes. This is consistent with its predicted sequence and potential role as an RNA binding protein.",1
"Human coronaviruses (HCV) are ubiquitous pathogens which cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, and possibly neurological disorders. To better understand the molecular biology of the prototype HCV-229E strain, the complete nucleotide sequence of the membrane protein (M) gene was determined from cloned cDNA. The open reading frame is preceded by a consensus transcriptional initiation sequence UCUAAACU, identical to the one found upstream of the N gene. The M gene encodes a 225-amino acid polypeptide with a molecular weight (MW) of 25,822, slightly higher than the apparent MW of 19,000–22,000 observed for the unprocessed M protein obtained after in vitro translation and immunoprecipitation. The M amino acid sequence presents a significant degree of homology (38%) with its counterpart of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV). The M protein of HCV-229E is highly hydrophobic and its hydropathicity profile shows a transmembranous region composed of three major hydrophobic domains characteristic of a typical coronavirus M protein. About 10% (20 amino acids) of the HCV-229E M protein constitutes a hydrophilic and probably external portion. One N-glycosylation and three potential O-glycosylation sites are found in this exposed domain.",1
"Antigenic variation among murine coronaviruses is associated primarily with the surface peplomer protein E2 (180,000 Dal. E2 is responsible for attachment of the virus to the host cell, MHV-induced cell fusion, and eliciting neutralizing antibody. We report here the molecular mimicry between E2 and Fc γ receptor (FcγR). Molecular mimicry between E2 and FcyR may allow the escape of virus-infected cells from destruction by immunological mechanisms. Rabbit IgG, monoclonal rat IgG1 and IgG2b, monoclonal mouse IgG2a and IgG2b, and the rat anti-mouse FcγR monoclonal antibody 2.4132 immunoprecipitated from MHV-JHM-infected cells a polypeptide with a molecular mass identical to that immunoprecipitated by anti-E2 antibodies. F(ab′)2 fragments of rabbit IgG did not immunoprecipitate any proteins from MHV-infected cells. All of these antibodies did not immunoprecipitate any proteins from uninfected cells. The anti-mouse FcyR monoclonal antibody 2.4132 immunoprecipitated from MHV-JHM-, MHV-3-, or MHV-A59-infected L-2 cells and 17CL-1 cells, or MHV-JHM-infected cultures of neonatal BALB/c brain cells, a protein with a molecular weight identical to that of MHV-JHM E2. The anti-FcyR monoclonal antibody did not immunoprecipitate any proteins from uninfected cells. Furthermore, the 2.4132 monoclonal antibody (mab), unrelated rat and mouse monoclonal antibodies, and a goat antiserum against E2, but not normal goat serum, immunoprecipitated a 75,000- to 77,000-Da molecule from uninfected WEHI-3 cells, a FcγR bearing cell line. Several lines of evidence demonstrated that the protein immunoprecipitated by the anti-FcγR mab from MHV-JHM-infected cells is the E2 glycoprotein: (1) Partial proteolytic maps obtained by Staphylococcus aureus V-8 protease treatment of the 180,000-Da proteins immunoprecipitated by the anti FcγR mab and the anti-E2 mab were identical. (2) Sequential immunoprecipitation experiments from MHV-JHM-infected cells revealed that the same polypeptide chain was recognized by the anti-E2 mab and by the anti-FcγR mab 2.41G2. (3) Actinomycin D did not influence the induction and expression of the 180,000-Da polypeptide chain that was immunoprecipitated by the anti-FcγR mab, demonstrating that this protein is of viral origin.",1
"The sequence of the spike (also called peplomer or E2) protein gene of the Mebus strain of bovine coronavirus (BCV) was obtained from cDNA clones of genomic RNA. The gene sequence predicts a 150,825 mol wt apoprotein of 1363 amino acids having an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence of 17 amino acids, 19 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, a hydrophobic anchor sequence of approximately 17 amino acids near the C terminus, and a hydrophilic cysteinerich C terminus of 35 amino acids. An internal LysArgArgSerArgArg sequence predicts a protease cleavage site between amino acids 768 and 769 that would separate the S apoprotein into S1 and S2 segments of 85690 and 65153 mol wt, respectively. Amino terminal amino acid sequencing of the virion-derived gp100 spike subunit confirmed the location of the predicted cleavage site, and established that gp120 and gp100 are the glycosylated virion forms of the S1 and S2 subunits, respectively. Sequence comparisons between BCV and the antigenically related mouse hepatitis coronavirus revealed more sequence divergence in the putative knob region of the spike protein (S1) than in the stem region (S2).",1
"We propose a nomenclature to replace the various systems currently in use to designate coronavirus structural proteins, mRNAs, and genes/open reading frames. The nonstructural proteins have not been addressed.",1
"The bovine coronavirus (BCV) spike glycoprotein precursor (S, formerly termed peplomer) and its two subunit polypeptides (S1 and S2) were individually expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells. Each recombinant baculovirus expressed both glycosylated (S, 170K; S1, 95K; S2, 80K) and unglycosylated (S0, 140K; S10, 75K; and S20, 65K) forms of BCV spike polypeptides in Sf9 cells. The mature 95K S1 polypeptide was secreted whereas the S and S2 polypeptides remained cell-associated. The S precursor was partially cleaved in Sf9 cells, and the resulting S1 was also released into the medium. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies representing two antigenic domains bound to recombinant S and S1 but not the S2 polypeptides, indicating that two major epitopes for BCV neutralization are located on the S1 subunit.",1
"To obtain information about the structure and evolution of the nucleocapsid (N) protein of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), we determined the entire nucleotide sequences of the N genes of MHV-A59, MHV-3, MHV-S, and MHV-1 from cDNA clones. At the nucleotide level, the N gene sequences of these viral strains, and that of MHV-JHM, were more than 92% conserved overall. Even higher nucleotide sequence identity was found in the 3′ untranslated regions (3′ UTRs) of the five strains, which may reflect the role of the 3′ UTR in negative-strand RNA synthesis. All five N genes were found to encode markedly basic proteins of 454 or 455 residues having at least 94% sequence identity in pairwise comparisons. However, amino acid sequence divergences were found to be clustered in two short segments of N, putative spacer regions that, together, constituted only 11% of the molecule. Thus, the data suggest that the MHV N protein is composed of three highly conserved structural domains connected to each other by regions that have much less constraint on their amino acid sequences. The first two conserved domains contain most of the excess of basic amino acid residues; by contrast, the carboxy-terminal domain is acidic. Finally, we noted that four of the five N genes contain an internal open reading frame that potentially encodes a protein of 207 amino acids having a large proportion of basic and hydrophobic residues.",1
"The nucleotide sequence of the peplomer (P) protein gene of Berne virus (BEV), the torovirus prototype, was determined. The gene encodes an apoprotein of 1581 amino acids with an Mr of about 178K. The open reading frame was cloned behind the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and its translation product was identified as the BEV P protein precursor by in vivo expression and immunoprecipitation. The deduced amino acid sequence contains a number of domains which are typical for type I membrane glycoproteins: an N-terminal signal sequence, a putative C-terminal transmembrane anchor, and a cytoplasmic tail. Eighteen potential N-glycosylation sites, two heptad repeat domains, and a possible “trypsin-like” cleavage site were identified. The mature P protein consists of two subunits and their electrophoretic mobility upon endoglycosidase F treatment strongly suggests that the predicted cleavage site is functional in vivo. The heptad repeat domains are probably involved in the generation of an intra-chain coiled-coil secondary structure; similar inter-chain interactions can play a role in P protein oligomerization. Using a sucrose gradient assay the P protein was indeed shown to form dimers. The intra- and inter-chain coiled-coil interactions may stabilize the elongated BEV peplomers.",1
"Plasmids encoding rubella virus (RV) structural proteins C-E2-Et, E2-Et, E2, and E1 have been constructed in the eukaryotic expression vector pCMV5. The processing and intracellular transport of these proteins have been examined by transient expression of the cDNAs in COS cells. Compared to alphaviruses, processing of RV glycoprotein moieties occurred relatively slowly and the transport of glycoproteins E2 and El to the plasma membrane was inefficient. Indirect immunofluoresence revealed that the majority of RV antigen in transfected and infected COS cells was localized to the Golgi region, including the capsid protein. Accumulation of capsid protein in the juxtanuclear region was determined to be RV glycoprotein dependent. Unlike alphaviruses, RV El did not require E2 for targeting to the Golgi where it was retained. E2 was however necessary for cell surface expression of Et. This study revealed that the processing and transport of RV structural proteins is quite different from alphaviruses and that the accumulation of antigens in the Golgi region may be significant in light of previous reports which suggest that RV buds from the internal membranes in some cell types.",1
"Virus-induced cell fusion has been examined in a series of stable cell lines which were originally selected for resistance to the fusogenic effects of polyethylene glycol (PEG). For a wide variety of viruses, including murine hepatitis virus (a coronavirus), vesicular stomatitis virus (a rhabdovirus), and two paramyxoviruses (Sendai virus and SV5), susceptibility to virus-induced fusion was found to be inversely correlated with susceptibility to PEG-induced fusion. This phenomenon was observed both for cell fusion occurring in the course of viral infection and for fusion induced “from without” by the addition of high titers of noninfectious or inactivated virus. The fusion-altered cell lines (fusible by virus but not by PEG) are characterized by their unusual lipid composition, including marked elevation of saturated fatty acids and the presence of an unusual ether-linked neutral lipid. To test the association between lipid composition and fusion, acyl chain saturation was manipulated by supplementing the culture medium with exogenous fatty acids. In such experiments, it was possible to control the responses of these cells to both viral and chemical fusogens. Increasing the cellular content of saturated fatty acyl chains increased the susceptibility of cells to viral fusion and decreased susceptibility to PEG-induced fusion, whereas lowering fatty acid saturation had the opposite effect. Thus, parallel cultures of cells can be either driven toward the PEG-fusible/virus-fusion-resistant phenotype of the parental cells or rendered susceptible to viral fusion but resistant to PEG-induced fusion, solely by the alteration of cellular lipids. The ability of cellular lipid composition to regulate virus-induced membrane fusion suggests a possible role for lipids in viral infection and pathogenesis",1
"After intranasal inoculation, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) gains entry into the central nervous system (CNS) via the olfactory and trigeminal nerves. Under the appropriate conditions, some mice develop clinically apparent demyelinating encephalomyelitis several weeks later, with virus always present in the spinal cord. To determine the pathway by which virus reaches the cord, brains and spinal cords of infected, asymptomatic mice were analyzed by in situ hybridization. Viral RNA was always detected in the anterior part of the upper spinal cord. A similar analysis of mice with the recent onset of hindlimb weakness showed that viral RNA was detected in the same location. The results suggest that MHV is transported to the spinal cord via well-defined neuroanatomic pathways and that viral amplification with resultant clinical disease occurs from this site of persistence in the anterior spinal cord. This process of viral amplification may involve the generation of viral variants as has been described for MHV-infected rats. No major changes in viral RNA or protein could be detected when MHV isolated from mice with hindlimb paralysis was analyzed. The data suggest that the generation of viral variants is not important in the pathogenesis of the late onset neurological disease induced by MHV in mice.",1
"Coronaviruses undergo RNA recombination at a very high frequency. To understand the mechanism of recombination in murine coronavirus, we have performed RNA sequencing of viral genomic RNA to determine the precise sites of recombination in a series of recombinants which have crossovers within the gene encoding the peplomer protein. We found that all of the recombination sites are clustered within a region of 278 nucleotides in the 5′-half of the gene. This region in which all of the crossovers occurred represents a small fraction of the distance between the two selection markers used for the isolation of these recombinant viruses. This result suggests that this region may be a preferred site for RNA recombination. The crossover sites are located within and immediately adjacent to a hypervariable area of the gene. This area has undergone deletions of varying sizes in several virus strains which have been passaged either in vivo or in vitro. These results suggest that a similar RNA structure may be involved in the occurrence of both recombination and deletion events.",1
"Intracellular events in the synthesis, glycosylation, and transport of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) glycoproteins have been examined. We have shown by N-glycanase digestion that LCMV strain Arm-4 bears five oligosaccharides on GP-1 and two on GP-2. By pulse-chase labeling experiments in the presence of drugs which inhibit N-linked oligosaccharide addition and processing we demonstrate that addition of high mannose precursor oligosaccharides is necessary for transport and cleavage of the viral GP-C glycoprotein. Moreover, in the presence of tunicamycin which inhibits en bloc addition of these mannose-rich side chains, virus budding was substantially decreased and infectious virions were reduced by more than 1000-fold in the supernatant medium. Incubation in the presence of castantospermine, which permits addition of oligomannosyl-rich chains but blocks further processing, restored transport and cleavage of GP-C and maturation of virions. Finally, by temperature block experiments we have determined that maturation of GP-C oligosaccharides to an endoglycosidase H resistant form precedes cleavage to GP-1 and GP-2. The latter process is most likely to occur in the Golgi or post-Golgi compartment.",1
"The nucleotide sequence of the rubella virus (RUB) genomic RNA was determined. The RUB genomic RNA is 9757 nucleotides in length [excluding the poly(A) tail] and has a G/C content of 69.5%, the highest of any RNA virus sequenced to date. The RUB genomic RNA contains two long open reading frames (ORFs), a 5′-proximal ORF of 6656 nucleotides and a 3′-proximal ORF of 3189 nucleotides which encodes the structural proteins. Thus, the genomic organization of RUB is similar to that of alphaviruses, the other genus of the Togavirus family, and the 5′-proximal ORF of RUB therefore putatively codes for the nonstructural proteins. Sequences homologous to three regions of nucleotide sequence highly conserved among alphaviruses (a stem-and-loop structure at the 5′ end of the genome, a 51-nucleotide conserved sequence near the 5′ end of the genome, and a 20-nucleotide conserved sequence at the subgenomic RNA start site) were found in the RUB genomic RNA. Amino acid sequence comparisons between the nonstructural ORF of RUB and alphaviruses revealed only one short (122 amino acids) region of significant homology, indicating that these viruses are only distantly related. This region of homology is located at the NH2 terminus of nsP3 in the alphavirus genome. The RUB nonstructural protein ORF contains two global amino acid motifs conserved in a large number of positive-polarity RNA viruses, a motif indicative of helicase activity and a motif indicative of replicase activity. The order of the helicase motif and the nsP3 homology region in the RUB genome is reversed with respect to the alphavirus genome indicating that a genetic rearrangement has occurred during the evolution of these viruses.",1
"The nucleotide sequence between the spike and membrane protein genes in the bovine coronavirus (BCV) genome was determined by sequencing cDNA clones of the genome, and open reading frames potentially encoding proteins of 4.9, 4.8, 12.7, and 9.5 kDa, in that order, were identified. The 4.9- and 4.8-kDa proteins appear to be vestiges of an 11-kDa protein for which a single nucleotide deletion event in the central part of the gene gave rise to a stop codon. The consensus CYAAAC sequence precedes the 4.9-, 12.7-, and 9.5-kDa ORFs and predicts that transcription will start from each of these sites. Northern analyses using sequence-specific probes and oligo(dT)-selected RNA demonstrated that the predicted transcripts are made, and that these correspond to mRNAs 4, 5, and 5-1. BCV mRNA 4 appears to be a counterpart to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) mRNA 4 which, in the MHV JHM strain, encodes the putative 15.2-kDa nonstructural protein. BCV mRNAs 5 and 5-1 appear to be used for the synthesis of the 12.7- and 9.5-kDa proteins, respectively, which demonstrates a pattern of expression strikingly different from that utilized by MHV. MHV makes its homologs of the 12.7- and 9.5-kDa proteins from the single mRNA 5. In vitro translation analyses demonstrated that the BCV 9.5-kDa protein, unlike its MHV counterpart, is poorly made from downstream initiation of translation. Thus, from a comparison between BCV and MHV we find evolutionary evidence for the importance of the CYAAAC sequence in regulating coronavirus transcription.",1
"Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was neutralized more than 109-fold with antibodies of a single specificity [monoclonal antibodies (MAbs)]. Most of the virus was neutralized in the first 2–3 min of a reversible reaction, which was followed by a second phase with a decreased neutralization rate and, in some cases, by a persistent fraction, which was a function of the MAb and of the antibody-to-virus ratio. Neutralization of TGEV is a specific event that requires the location of the epitope involved in the neutralization in the appropriate structural context, which is present in the wild-type virus but not in certain MAb escaping mutants. In neutralization of TGEV by binary combinations of MAbs specific for the same or for different antigenic sites, either no cooperation or a synergistic effect, respectively, was observed. Mechanisms of TGEV neutralization by MAbs were characterized at high, intermediate, and low antibody-to-virus ratios. Under these conditions, mainly three steps of the replication cycle were inhibited: binding of virus to the cell, internalization, and a step that takes place after internalization. In addition, virus aggregation could be responsible for the neutralization of 10 to 20% of virus infectivity.",1
"A panel of 26 temperature-sensitive mutants of MHV-A59 were selected by mutagenesis with either 5-fluorouracil or 5-azacytidine. Complementation analysis revealed the presence of one RNA+ and five RNA− complementation groups. None of the RNA− complementation groups transcribed detectable levels of positive- or negative-stranded RNA at the restrictive temperature. Temperature shift experiments after the onset of mRNA synthesis revealed at least two classes of RNA− mutants. RNA− complementation groups A, B, D, and E were blocked in the ability to release infectious virus and transcribe mRNA and genome, while group C mutants continued to release infectious virus and transcribe both mRNA and genome. Temperature shift experiments at different times postinfection suggest that the group C mutants encode a function required early in viral transcription which affects the overall rate of positive strand synthesis. Analysis of steady state levels of negative strand RNA after the shift indicate that the group C mutants were probably blocked in the ability to synthesize additional minus strand RNA under conditions in which the group E mutants continued low levels of minus strand synthesis. These data suggest that at least four cistrons may be required for positive strand synthesis while the group C cistron functions during minus strand synthesis.",1
"MHV-A59 temperature-sensitive mutants, representing one RNA+ and five RNA− complementation groups, were isolated and characterized by genetic recombination techniques. Maximum recombination frequencies occurred under multiplicities of infection greater than 10 each in which 99.99% of the cells were co-infected. Recombination frequencies between different is mutants increased steadily during infection and peaked late in the virus growth cycle. These data suggest that recombination is a late event in the virus replication cycle. Recombination frequencies were also found to range from 63 to 20,000 times higher than the sum of the spontaneous reversion frequencies of each is mutant used in the cross. Utilizing standard genetic recombination techniques, the five RNA− complementation groups of MHV-A59 were arranged into an additive, linear, genetic map located at the 5′ end of the genome in the 23-kb polymerase region. These data indicate that at least five distinct functions are encoded in the MHV polymerase region which function in virus transcription. Moreover, using well-characterized is mutants the recombination frequency for the entire 32-kb MHV genome was found to approach 25% or more. This is the highest recombination frequency described for a nonsegmented, linear, plus-polarity RNA virus.",1
"Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) is currently classified within the Togaviridae family. In an effort to obtain further information on the characteristics of this virus, we have begun to sequence the viral RNA genome and to map the virion structural protein genes. A sequence of 1064 nucleotides, which represents the 3′ terminal end of the genome, was obtained from LDV cDNA clones. A 3′ noncoding region of 80 nucleotides followed by two complete open reading frames (ORFs) were found within this sequence. The two ORFs were in different reading frames and overlapped each other by 11 nucleotides. One ORF encoded a protein of 170 amino acids and the other ORF, located adjacent to the 3′ noncoding region of the viral genome, encoded a 114 amino acid protein. Thirty-three N-terminal residues were sequenced directly from purified LDV capsid protein, Vpi, and this amino acid sequence mapped to the ORF adjacent to the 3′ noncoding region. The presence of overlapping ORFs and the 3′ terminal map position of Vpi indicate that LDV differs significantly from the prototype alpha togaviruses.",1
"Early events of infection of MHV were studied in comparison with those of VSV, which is known to enter cells by an endocytic pathway. Treatment of mouse L-2 fibroblasts with ammonium chloride, chloroquine, or dansylcadaverine inhibited infection of MHV to a much lesser degree than that of VSV, suggesting a relatively minor role for the endocytic pathway and functional endosomes in MHV infection. Endocytosis of MHV and VSV into L-2 cells was assayed by the recovery of infectious (i.e., not uncoated) viruses from homogenates of cells harvested within the first few minutes of infection (and treated with protease to remove surface-bound virus). The results thus suggest that while a small proportion of the MHV inoculum is internalized by endocytosis, productive infection does not depend on functional endocytosis as utilized by VSV. Studies on direct virion-mediated cell fusion showed that MHV can induce fusion at pH 7.4, whereas VSV causes fusion at pH 5.0. Taken together, the above results suggest that MHV enters L-2 cells predominantly by membrane fusion with a non-acidified compartment such as the plasma membrane, endocytic vesicles, or endosomes (prior to their acidification). Results obtained from cell lines which differed in permissiveness to MHV infection suggested that the ability to support MHV infection does not correlate with endocytosis. Rather, nonpermissive cells, such as rat astrocytoma (C-6) and Vero cells, showed higher levels of recoverable internalized MHV than did fully permissive L-2 cells. Cells which are normally nonpermissive to MHV, could be rendered MHV-susceptible by PEG-induced fusion of cell surface-bound virus. Such PEG-mediated susceptibility to MHV infection was insensitive to inhibition by ammonium chloride, supporting the idea that host cell restriction of MHV infection in C-6 and Vero cells may be due to a block in nonendosomal membrane fusion. Thus endocytic internalization of MHV, which clearly occurs in a variety of cells, does not guarantee productive infection.",1
"Bovine coronavirus (BCV) and hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV) from swine were found to grow to high titers in MDCK I cells, a subline of Madin Darby canine kidney cells. Virus grown in these cells was used to isolate and purify the HE-protein. This protein has been shown recently to have acetylesterase activity and to function as the receptor-destroying enzyme of BCV. Here we show that HEV contains this enzyme, too. The glycoproteins were solubilized by treatment of virions with octylglucoside. Following centrifugation through a sucrose gradient the surface proteins S and HE (hemagglutinin-esterase) were obtained in purified form. After removal of the detergent by dialysis, HE formed rosettes as shown by electron microscopy. The purified HE protein retained acetylesterase activity and was able to function as a receptor-destroying enzyme rendering red blood cells resistant against agglutination by both coronaviruses. HE protein released from the viral membrane failed to agglutinate red blood cells. However, it was found to recognize glycoconjugates containing N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid as indicated by a binding assay with rat serum proteins blotted to nitrocellulose and by its ability to inhibit the hemagglutinating activity of BCV, HEV, and influenza C virus. The purified enzyme provides a useful tool for analyzing the cellular receptors for coronaviruses.",1
"The hemagglutinin/esterase (HE), spike precursor (S) and the S1 and S2 subunits of the spike precursor protein of bovine coronavirus were expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells, and the cell-fusing activity of each recombinant glycoprotein was examined. Extensive syncytia formation was observed in cells infected with the S2 recombinant but not with the HE or S1 recombinant baculoviruses. Fusion of Sf9 cells expressing the intact S protein precursor was evident after trypsin treatment. These results demonstrate that proteolytic cleavage of the S spike precursor is required for fusion induction and that the fusion is mediated by the S2 subunit. These observations may reflect the biological role of the S2 subunit in fusion-penetration during bovine coronavirus infection.",1
"Recently, toroviruses and coronaviruses have been found to be ancestrally related by divergence of their polymerase and envelope proteins from common ancestors. In addition, their genome organization and expression strategy, which involves the synthesis of a 3′-coterminal nested set of mRNAs, are comparable. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the genome of the torovirus prototype, Berne virus (BEV), has now revealed the results of two independent nonhomologous RNA recombinations during torovirus evolution. Berne virus open reading frame (ORF) 4 encodes a protein with significant sequence similarity (30–35% identical residues) to a part of the hemagglutinin esterase proteins of corona-viruses and influenza virus C. The sequence of the C-terminal part of the predicted BEV polymerase ORF1a product contains 31–36% identical amino acids when compared with the sequence of a nonstructural 30 32K corona-virus protein. The cluster of coronaviruses which contains this nonstructural gene expresses it not as a part of their polymerase, but by synthesizing an additional subgenomic mRNA.",1
"The 5′-most gene, gene 1, of the genome of murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), is presumed to encode the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. We have determined the complete sequence of this gene of the JHM strain by cDNA cloning and sequencing. The total length of this gene is 21,798 nucleotides long, which includes two overlapping, large open reading frames. The first open reading frame, ORF 1 a, is 4488 amino acids long. The second open reading frame, ORF 1 b, overlaps ORF 1 a for 75 nucleotides, and is 2731 amino acids long. The overlapping region may fold into a pseudoknot RNA structure, similar to the corresponding region of the RNA of avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The in vitro transcription and translation studies of this region indicated that these two ORFs were most likely translated into one polyprotein by a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism. Thus, the predicted molecular weight of the gene 1 product is more than 800,000 Da. The sequence of ORF 1 b is very similar to the corresponding ORF of IBV. In contrast, the ORF 1 a of these two viruses differ in size and have a high degree of divergence. The amino acid sequence analysis suggested that ORF 1 a contains several functional domains, including two hydrophobic, membrane-anchoring domains, and three cysteine-rich domains. It also contains a picornaviral 3C-like protease domain and two papain-like protease domains. The presence of these protease domains suggests that the polyprotein is most likely processed into multiple protein products. In contrast, the ORF 1b contains polymerase, helicase, and zinc-finger motifs. These sequence studies suggested that the MHV gene 1 product is involved in RNA synthesis, and that this product is processed autoproteolytically after translation. This study completes the sequence of the MHV genome, which is 31 kb long, and constitutes the largest viral RNA known.",1
"The evidence presented shows that the M2 protein of influenza A viruses exists in infected cells as a homotetramer composed of two disulfide-linked dimers held together by noncovalent interactions. The amphiphilic nature of the transmembrane α-helical domain is consistent with the protein forming a transmembrane channel with which amantadine, the specific anti-influenza A drug, interacts. Together these features provide a structural basis for the hypothesis that M2 has a proton translocation function capable of regulating the pH of vesicles of the trans-Golgi network, a role important in promoting the correct maturation of the hemagglutinin glycoprotein.",1
"Two conformation-dependent neutralizing epitopes, A and B, have been mapped to the S1 subunit of the S spike glycoprotein of bovine coronavirus (BCV). In order to characterize the structure of these antigenic sites, we constructed a series of cDNA clones encoding deleted or truncated S1 derivatives and expressed the modified genes in insect cells using recombinant baculoviruses. Monoclonal antibodies directed against epitopes A and B recognized only the mutant S1 polypeptides containing amino acids 324–720, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol. In addition, two domains within this region were identified and only mutants containing both domains were immunoreactive, indicating that both were critical in the formation of the antigenic determinants. One domain was localized between residues 324 and 403 and the other at residues 517–720. Deletion of either domain inhibited extracellular secretion of the mutant proteins whereas mutants containing both or none of the domains were secreted efficiently. This observation suggests a vital function of the native conformation of the S1 protein in both antigenic structure and intracellular transport. Antigenic determinants A and B were not distinguished, but these determinants appeared to require both domains for epitope formation. Our results suggest that the antigenic determinants formed by two domains are likely associated with the probable polymorphic region of the BCV S1 subunit.",1
"Expression, ribosomal frameshifting, and proteolytic processing of HIV-1 GAG and POL proteins were investigated in heterologous mammalian cells in order to elucidate the influence of the cellular background on these events. DNA fragments encoded by the gag and pol region were expressed in two rodent cell lines, LTK- and BHK. Both stably transfected cell lines continuously produce recombinant proteins which react with HIV-specific antisera. The GAG precursor and a 39-kDa proteolytic fragment thereof were the major recombinant proteins detected. Expression of the gag-pol region leads to the production of the GAG-POL precursor. Ribosomal frameshifting at the HIV-1 shifty sequence to a typical extent could be positively demonstrated by an enzyme assay. Despite the presence of the viral protease within the GAG-POL precursors, proteolytic processing of the HIV-derived polyproteins was extremely inefficient. The efficiency could not be enhanced by overexpression of the HIV-1 protease encoding region.",1
"The S glycoprotein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) has been shown to contain four major antigenic sites (A, B, C, and D). Site A is the main inducer of neutralizing antibodies and has been previously subdivided into the three subsites Aa, Ab, and Ac. The residues that contribute to these sites were localized by sequence analysis of 21 mutants that escaped neutralization or binding by TGEV-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), and by epitope scanning (PEPSCAN). Site A contains the residues 538, 591, and 543, which are essential in the formation of subsites Aa, Ab, and Ac, respectively. In addition, mar mutant 1B.H6 with residue 586 changed had partially altered both subsite Aa and Ab, indicating that these subsites overlap in residue 586; i.e. this residue also is part of site A. The peptide 537-MKSGYGQPIA-547 represents, at least partially, subsite Ac which is highly conserved among coronaviruses. This site is relevant for diagnosis and could be of interest for protection. Other residues contribute to site B (residues 97 and 144), site C (residues 50 and 51), and site D (residue 385). The location of site D is in agreement with PEPSCAN results. Site C can be represented by the peptide 48-P-P/S-N-S-D/E-52 but is not exposed on the surface of native virus. Its accessibility can be modulated by treatment at pH >11 (at 4°) and temperatures >45°. Sites A and B are fully dependent on glycosylation for proper folding, while sites C and D are fully or partially independent of glycosylation, respectively. Once the S glycoprotein has been assembled into the virion, the carbohydrate moiety is not essential for the antigenic sites.",1
"The pol gene of the Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) is expressed as a Gag-Pol fusion protein through an in-frame suppression of the UAG termination codon located between the two genes. The role of nucleotide context in suppression was investigated, in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation system, using site-directed mutagenesis. The results indicate that the translational readthrough is mediated by at least 50 bases long RNA sequence located 3′ to the gag UAG termination codon. Within this sequence a short purine-rich sequence adjacent to the amber codon, highly conserved among different retroviruses, appears essential for M-MuLV suppression. Two alternative putative stem and loop like RNA structures can be drawn at the gag-pol junction, one abutting the gag UAG codon, and the second downstream to it. None of these structures appears to be important to the suppression process.",1
"After intranasal instillation in the mouse, rabies virus (CVS strain) selectively infected olfactory receptor cells. In the main olfactory bulb (MOB), infection was observed in periglomerular, tufted, and mitral cells and in interneurons located in the internal plexiform layer. Beyond the MOB, CVS spread into the brain along the olfactory pathways. This infection is specific to chains of functionally related neurons but at the death of the animal some nuclei remain uninfected. CVS also penetrated the trigeminal system. The avirulent mutant AvOl, carrying a mutation in position 333 of the glycoprotein, infected the olfactory epithelium and the trigeminal nerve as efficiently as CVS. During the second cycle of infection, the mutant was able to infect efficiently periglomerular cells in the MOB and neurons of the horizontal limb of the diagonal band, which indicates that maturation of infective particles is not affected in primarily infected neuronal cells. On the other hand, other neuronal cells permissive for CVS, such as mitral cells or the anterior olfactory nucleus, are completely free of infection with the mutant, indicating that restriction is related to the ability of AvO1 to penetrate several categories of neurons. From these observations, we concluded that CVS should be able to bind several different receptors to penetrate neurons, while the mutant would be unable to recognize some of them.",1
"The glycoproteins of bunyaviruses accumulate in membranes of the Golgi complex, where virus maturation occurs by budding. In this study we have constructed a series of full length or truncated mutants of the G2 glycoprotein of Punta Toro virus (PTV), a member of the Phlebovirus genus of the Bunyaviridae, and investigated their transport properties. The results indicate that the hydrophobic domain preceding the G2 glycoprotein can function as a translocational signal peptide, and that the hydrophobic domain near the C-terminus serves as a membrane anchor. A G2 glycoprotein construct with an extra hydrophobic sequence derived from the N-terminal NSM region was stably retained in the ER, and was unable to be transported to the Golgi complex. The full-length G2 glycoprotein, when expressed on its own, was transported out of the ER and expressed on the cell surface, whereas the G1 and G2 proteins when expressed together are retained in the Golgi complex. A truncated anchor-minus form of the G2 glycoprotein was found to be secreted into the culture medium, but was retained in the Golgi complex when coexpressed with the G1 glycoprotein. These results indicate that the G2 membrane glycoprotein is a class I membrane protein which does not contain a signal sufficient for Golgi retention, and suggest that its Golgi localization is a result of association with the G1 glycoprotein.",1
"The entire nucleotide sequences of the spike glycoprotein (S) genes of the highly virulent bovine coronavirus (BCV) strain BCV-LY138, the avirulent BCV-L9 and related Norden Vaccine (BCV-Vaccine) strains were determined using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify cDNAs obtained by reverse transcription of viral RNA, and to produce single strand cDNAs for DNA sequencing. The S gene sequences of these viral strains were compared with those of recently published strains BCV-Mebus, BCV-Quebec, and BCV-F15. An open reading frame of 4092 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 1363 amino acid residues, was found in all six strains. Frameshifts and insertions or deletions were not observed except for the BCV-Fl 5. The S gene sequences were more than 98% conserved overall inspite of different origins of the six viruses. There were 45 to 56 nt differences between the virulent and avirulent groups while there were 6 to 14 nt differences among four avirulent strains. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences indicated that the S proteins had typical properties of membrane glycoproteins. Nineteen Winked glycosylation sites were predicted in five strains, and 18 of them were conserved in the avirulent strain BCV-L9. The sequence KRRSRR at the predicted proteolytic cleavage site was identified in five strains while the sequence KRRSVR was found in BCV-Fl 5. Substitutions of few amino acids in the putative fusogenic domains and two prolines at 507 and 567 in the antigenic domains may cause altered immunogenic and other functional properties of the S proteins specified by the virulent and avirulent BCV strains. Nine amino acid substitutions between the virulent and avirulent groups may correlate with BCV virulence.",1
"Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against two major structural proteins of the cell-adapted Mebus strain of bovine coronavirus (BCV-L9) were produced and characterized. Seven MAbs reacted with the peplomeric glycoprotein, gp100/S, while three MAbs reacted with the nucleoprotein p53/N in Western blot analysis of BCV polypeptides. MAbs to gp100/S reacted with discontinuous epitopes of gp100/S in Westerns under mild but not under standard denaturing conditions. In contrast, MAbs to p53/N reacted in both types of Westerns, and those epitopes were thus continuous. MAbs to p53/N failed to neutralize BCV infectivity, while 4 MAbs to gp100/S neutralized BCV effectively. Cross reactivity of MAbs to gp100/S specified by five virulent wild-type strains and two high passage, cell-culture-adapted strains in mildly denaturing Westerns and neutralization assays indicated that two epitopes were conserved in all seven strains, while two epitopes of the avirulent strains were not detected in the wild-type strains. Non-neutralizing MAbs of gp100/S reacted with all seven strains in Westerns with the exception of one MAb that was specific for the highly cell-adapted strain BCV-L9.",1
"The third largest of the nested set of subgenomic mRNAs (mRNA3) from the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) contains three separate open reading frames (3a, 3b, and 3c) which are not present on the next smallest of the mRNAs, suggesting that this mRNA may be functionally polycistronic. However, although a protein product has been identified from the 3c open reading frame, to date the coding function of 3a and 3b has not been established. We present nucleotide sequence data suggesting that each of the three open reading frames is conserved in a variety of different IBV strains and further show, through the preparation of monospecific antisera against bacterial fusion proteins, that IBV-infected cells contain small amounts of the products of these ORFs. In vitro translation studies using synthetic mRNAs containing the 3a, 3b, and 3c open reading frames suggest strongly that all three proteins can be translated from a single molecular species, and expression studies carried out in intact cells support this conclusion. Thus mRNA3 of IBV appears to be functionally tricistronic.",1
The major subgenomic RNA of the calicivirus rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus which codes for the viral capsid protein has been cloned as cDNA. The nucleotide sequence of this mRNA was shown to be identical to the 3′ terminal region of the genomic RNA. The 5′ end of the mRNA corresponds to position 5296 of the genomic sequence; except for two differences the first 16 nucleotides of genomic and subgenomic RNAs are identical. After isolation from liver tissue viral genomic and subgenomic RNAs were found to be resistant to RNase degradation. This protection was due to RNA packaging into particles. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation of liver homogenates allowed separation of such particles containing either genomic RNA or subgenomic RNA. Genomic and subgenomic RNAs are protein-linked and for the genomic molecule this interaction is localized within the first 179 nucleotides. After radioactive labeling of purified RNA and subsequent RNase treatment a protein of 15 kDa was identified.,1
"Defective interfering (DI) RNAs were generated de novo in each of 12 independent isolates of tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) upon serial passage at high multiplicities of infection (m.o.i.) in plants, but not in any of 4 additional isolates after 11 serial passages at low m.o.i. The DI RNAs were detected in RNA isolated from virus particles and in 2.3 M LiCl-soluble RNA fractions isolated from inoculated leaves. Symptom attenuation leading to persistent infections was closely correlated with the passage in which DIs first developed. Comparisons of nucleotide sequences of 10 cDNA clones from 2 DI RNA populations and with a previously characterized TBSV DI RNA revealed the same four regions of sequence from the TBSV genome were strictly conserved in each of the DI RNAs: the virus 5′ leader sequence of 168 bases; a region of approximately 200–250 bases from the viral polymerase gene; approximately 70 bases from the 3′ terminus of the viral pl9 and p22 genes; and approximately 130 bases from the 3′terminal noncoding region. Conservation of the sequence motif present in all of the DIs suggests that there might be a common mechanism of DI formation as well as selection pressure to maintain sequences essential for replication and encapsidation.",1
"Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) causes a mostly fatal, immunologically mediated disease in cats. Previously, we demonstrated that immunization with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the FIPV spike protein (S) induced early death after challenge with FIPV (Vennema et al., 1990, J. Virol. 64, 1407–1409). In this paper we describe similar immunizations with the FIPV membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The genes encoding these proteins were cloned and sequenced. Comparison of the amino acid sequences with the corresponding sequences of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus revealed 84.7 and 77% identity for M and N, respectively. Vaccinia virus recombinants expressing the cloned genes induced antibodies in immunized kittens. Immunization with neither recombinant induced early death after challenge with FIPV, strongly suggesting that antibody-dependent enhancement is mediated by antibodies against S only. Immunization with the N protein recombinant had no apparent effect on the outcome of challenge. However, three of eight kittens immunized with the M protein recombinant survived the challenge, as compared to one of eight kittens of the control group.",1
"The S gene of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was inserted into the genome of Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) using the transfer plasmid pVL941. Infection of Sf9 insect cells with the recombinant virus resulted in the synthesis of a 175K polypeptide which was able to trimerize and was transported to the cell surface as is the authentic TGEV S protein. Despite the lack of complete carbohydrate processing, the recombinant S protein exhibited antigenic properties similar to TGEV S and induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies in immunized rats. Engineering a deletion (70 amino acids) into the carboxy-terminus containing the membrane anchor of the polypeptide allowed its secretion. The oligomerization process and the antigenic profile of the anchor-free S protein were shown to be partially altered.",1
"The entire nucleotide sequences of the hemagglutinin/esterase (HE) genes specified by the highly virulent strain LY138 and the avirulent strain L9 of bovine coronavirus (BCV) were determined. These sequences were compared with recently published sequences of the HE genes of the Quebec and Mebus strains. A large open reading frame of 1272 nt encoding a protein of 424 amino acid residues was predicted. The putative esterase active site was conserved in the virulent and avirulent BCV strains, indicating that this domain is probably not a determinant for BCV virulence. Four amino acid substitutions occurred between the HE proteins of BCV-L9 and BCV-LY138 (Leu to Pro at 5, Leu to Val at 103, Ser to Pro at 367, and Thr to Asn at 379). Monoclonal antibodies specific for the HE glycoprotein inhibited the hemagglutination and acetylesterase activities of BCV-L9, but showed no inhibitory effect on the acetylesterase activity of BCV-LY138. These results suggest that at least one epitope is located proximal to one of the three strain-specific amino acids. Four S-specific monoclonal antibodies inhibited hemagglutination but not acetylesterase activity of BCVL9, implying that the S glycoprotein can promote hemagglutination of chicken erythrocytes in addition to the HE glycoprotein.",1
"A highly purified radiolabeled preparation of the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was analyzed, by immunoprecipitation with monospecific antisera, for the presence of a series of small virus proteins recently identified as the products of I BV mRNAs 3 and 5. One of these, 3c, a 12.4K protein encoded by the third open reading frame of the tricistronic mRNA3 was clearly detectable and was found to cofractionate with virion envelope proteins on detergent disruption of virus particles. These results, together with the hydrophobic nature of 3c and its previously demonstrated association with the membranes of infected cells, suggest strongly that 3c represents a new virion envelope protein, which may have counterparts in other coronaviruses.",1
"The nucleotide sequence of the Berne virus envelope (E) protein gene was determined and its 26.5K translation product was identified by in vitro transcription and translation. Computer analysis of the protein sequence revealed the characteristics of a class III membrane protein lacking a cleaved signal sequence but containing three successive transmembrane α-helices in the N-terminal half, much the same as the coronavirus membrane (M) protein. The disposition of the E protein in the membrane was studied by in vitro translation in the presence of microsomes and by subsequent proteinase K digestion. Only small portions of either end of the polypeptide were found to be exposed on opposite sides of the vesicle membranes. Experiments with a hybrid E protein (EM) containing the C-terminal tail of a coronavirus M protein, to which an anti-peptide serum was available, showed that this C-terminus was present at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, which is another similarity to the coronavirus M protein. Immunofluorescence experiments indicated that the EM protein, expressed by a recombinant vaccinia virus, accumulated in intracellular membranes, predominantly those of the endoplasmic reticulum. The common features of the torovirus E and the coronavirus M protein support our hypothesis that an evolutionary relationship exists between these groups of intracellularly budding viruses.",1
"The Spike (S) protein from a virulent British field isolate of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) FS772/70 was constructed from cDNA and inserted into the vaccinia virus (VV) thymidine kinase gene locus under the control of the VV early/late gene P7.5K promoter. Recombinant S protein was synthesized as an endo-β-N-acetylglucosamini-dase H (Endo H)-sensitive glycoprotein with high mannose simple oligosaccharides (gp190) that underwent post-translational modification to an Endo H-resistant glycoprotein with complex oligosaccharides (gp210). Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that the majority of recombinant S protein was retained at the Golgi but some S protein was expressed on the plasma membrane. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against native S protein reacted with this recombinant S protein; also, mice infected with the recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) expressing the S protein induced TGEV neutralizing antibodies. A truncated S protein (SΔ) was also expressed in rVV-infected cells by introducing a deletion into the S protein cDNA that removed 292 amino acids from the C-terminus. The SΔ protein (gpl70) was shown to be antigenically similar to TGEV S protein by immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation tests but was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and not expressed on the cell surface.",1
"The intracellular RNA of two neurotropic variants of the JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) independently isolated from the brain and spinal cord of an infected Wistar Furth rat were compared with that of the parental virus. The mRNAs corresponding to the genes encoding the peplomer (S) and the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) proteins of the variant viruses were found to be smaller in size. The possible sequence changes were studied by oligonucleotide fingerprinting and direct RNA sequencing. Both variants have a large deletion of 246 amino acids in the carboxy-terminal end of the HE protein. However, this truncated protein was not detected in the infected cells, suggesting either a translational regulation or rapid degradation of the truncated protein in these cells. The variant virus isolated from the spinal cord has a second deletion of 147 amino acids in the amino-terminal half of the S protein. This deletion site corresponds to a hypervariable region where deletions have been frequently noted among MHV variants with different biological properties. These findings suggest that the changes in pathogenic properties of the two neural isolates are associated with drastic alterations of the viral structural glycoproteins.",1
"The complete nucleotide sequence of the second largest RNA segment of Dhori/India/1313/61 virus was determined and the deduced amino acid sequence was compared with the polymerase (P) proteins of influenza A, B, and C viruses. RNA segment 2 (2224 nucleotides) of Dhori virus contains a single long open reading frame that can encode a 716-amino amid polypeptide (81.3 kDa). The predicted polypeptide shares between 27 and 31% sequence identities with the PB1 polypeptides of influenza A, B, and C viruses. Among the regions most highly conserved are the sequences around the Asp-Asp motif common to many RNA polymerases. In spite of the high level of sequence identity between the Dhori RNA segment 2 gene product and the influenza A, B, and C virus PB1 proteins the amino acid composition of the Dhori protein indicates an acidic charge feature at pH 7.0 in contrast to the basic nature of the PB1 proteins of the influenza viruses. We suggest that the Dhori PB1-like protein be designated the Pα protein of this virus.",1
"The oligomerization domain of the reovirus cell attachment protein (σ1) was probed using the type 3 reovirus of synthesized in vitro. Trypsin cleaved the α1 protein (49K molecular weight) approximately in the middle and yielded a 26K N-terminal fragment and a 23K C-terminal fragment. Under conditions which allowed for the identification of intact σ1 in the oligomeric form (∼200K) by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the N-terminal 26K fragment was found to exist as stable trimers (80K) and, to a less extent, as dimers (54K), whereas the C-terminal fragment remained in the monomeric form. A polypeptide (161 amino acids) containing the N-terminal heptad repeat region synthesized in vitro was capable of forming stable dimers and trimers. Using various criteria, we demonstrated that the stability of the intact σ1 oligomer is conferred mainly by the N-terminal heptad repeat region. Our results are summarized in a model in which individual heptad repeats are held together in a three-stranded α-helical coiled-coil structure via both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions.",1
"The nucleotide sequence of the glycoprotein (G) gene of sonchus yellow net virus (SYNV), a plant rhabdovirus, was determined from viral genomic and mRNA cDNA clones. The G cistron is 2045 nucleotides (nt) long and the G protein mRNA open reading frame (ORF), as determined from the cDNA sequence, contains 1896 nt and encodes a protein of 632 amino acids. Immunoblots with antibodies elicited against the purified glycoprotein from virus particles reacted with a fusion protein produced in Escherichia coli, indicating that the cloned ORF encodes the G protein. The 5′ end of the G protein mRNA corresponds to nt 5111, relative to the 3′ end of the viral (minus sense) genome, as determined by primer extension from mRNA isolated from infected plants, and extends to nt position 7155 on the genomic RNA. A 34-nt untranslated 5′ leader sequence and a 115-nt untranslated 3′ end flank the ORF on the mRNA. The gene junctions on either side of the G gene on the genomic RNA are identical to those previously described for other SYNV genes and are similar to sequences separating genes of animal rhabdoviruses. The predicted molecular weight of the G protein is 70,215 Da, a value less than the 77,000 Da estimated for the glycosylated G protein from virus particles. The deduced amino acid sequence of the SYNV G protein shares little direct relatedness with the G proteins of other rhabdoviruses, but appears to contain a similar signal sequence, a transmembrane anchor domain, and glycosylation signals. In addition, the SYNV G protein contains a putative nuclear targeting site near the carboxy terminus, which may be involved in transit to the nuclear membrane prior to morphogenesis.",1
"We have recently described the cloning of a portion of the hepatitis E virus (HEV) and confirmed its etiologic association with enterically transmitted (waterborne, epidemic) non-A, non-B hepatitis. The virus consists of a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 7.5 kb, with a polyadenylated 3' end. We now report on the cloning and nucleotide sequencing of an overlapping, contiguous set of cDNA clones representing the entire genome of the HEV Burma strain [HEV(B)]. The largest open reading frame extends approximately 5 kb from the Fend and contains the RNA-directed RNA polymerase and nucleoside triphosphate binding motifs. The second major open reading frame (ORF2) begins 37 by downstream of the first and extends approximately 2 kb to the termination codon present 65 by from the 3' terminal stretch of poly(A) residues. ORF2 contains a consensus signal peptide sequence at its amino terminus and a capsid-like region with a high content of basic amino acids similar to that seen with other virus capsid proteins. A third open reading frame partially overlaps the first and second and encompasses only 369 bp. In addition to the 7.5-kb full-length genomic transcript, two subgenomic polyadenylated messages of approximately 3.7 and 2.0 kb were detected in infected liver using a probe from the 3' third of the genome. The genomic organization of the virus is consistent with the Fend encoding nonstructural and the 3' end encoding the viral structural gene(s). The expression strategy of the virus involves the use of three different open reading frames and at least three different transcripts. HEV was previously determined to be a nonenveloped particle with a diameter of 27–34 nm. These findings on the genetic organization and expression strategy of HEV suggest that it is the prototype human pathogen for a new class of RNA virus or perhaps a separate genus within the Caliciviridae family",1
"RNA-RNA recombination is thought to occur preferentially at certain selected sites and in only a few RNA viruses; the mechanism for these restrictions is unknown. In this paper we report the development of a recombination assay for coronavirus, using polymerase chain reaction, in the absence of selection pressure. Our results showed that within a 1-kb region of the peplomer gene, RNA recombination occurred at almost every potential crossover site. Thus, coronavirus RNA recombination appears to be more random than previously realized. However, after serial passages of the recombinant viruses in tissue culture, the recombination sites among the progeny viruses became clustered in the region which contains the previously reported “hot spot” for coronavirus recombination. These results suggest that RNA recombination is common and random in nature, but only certain recombinants can be selected. Thus, the presence of recombinational “hot spots” for coronavirus or other RNA viruses most likely resulted from selection of certain recombinant viruses and not restriction on the occurrence of RNA recombination. The failure to detect recombinants in other RNA viruses may therefore be due to unfavorable properties of recombinant viruses. This approach can be used to detect recombinants in these viruses.",1
"To investigate the nature of the bovine coronavirus (BCV) ns2 protein, the gene encoding this protein was cloned and was expressed as a β-galactosidase fusion protein. Antiserum raised against this protein reacted specifically with BCV-infected fixed cells in indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and precipitated an in vitro synthesized product approximately 32-kDa in molecular weight and an equivalent protein from BCV-infected cells. The synthesis of ns2 was found to be similar to the structural proteins of BCV and pulse-chase experiments indicated that ns2 protein was stable and that it accumulated in BCV-infected cells. Synthesis of ns2 in the presence of [31P] orthophosphate revealed that it is a phosphoprotein. Phosphoamino acid analysis confirmed the phosphorylated nature of ns2 and identified serine and threonine as its phosphorylated amino acid residues. This is the first demonstration of a phosphorylated nonstructural protein in coronavirus-infected cells.",1
"The oligomerization state of the reovirus cell attachment protein σ1 (49K monomeric molecular weight) was determined by biochemical and biophysical means. Full-length (protein product designated A) and C-terminal truncated (protein product designated B) serotype 3 reovirus Sl mRNA transcripts synthesizedin vitro were cotranslated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and the products were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under conditions which allowed for the identification of oligomeric forms of σl. A total of four oligomeric protein bands (corresponding to A3, A2B1, A1B2, and B3, respectively) was consistently observed, which suggests that the protein is made up of three monomeric subunits. Biophysical characterization of purified σ1 using column filtration and sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis confirmed the highly asymmetric shape of σ1 and allowed us to determine the molecular weight of the native protein to be ∼132K (a trimer). Similar biophysical analysis on the two tryptic fragments of the σ1 [N-terminal fibrous tail (26K monomeric molecular weight) and the C-terminal globular head (23K monomeric molecular weight)] yielded molecular weights of 77K and 64K, respectively, both again corresponding to trimers. We therefore conclude that protein σ1 is a homotrimer and provide, with supportive experimental evidence, a rationale for the anomalous behavior of the oligomeric protein in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, which, coupled with chemical cross-linking studies, has in part led to the previous suggestion that σ1 might be a higher order oligomer.",1
"The Sendai virus V protein, which is a fusion of the P and V ORFs of the P gene, was characterized with antisera to a portion of the V ORF and compared to the P protein. The only property found in common with P is that V is also highly phosphorylated, and this is so even when these proteins are expressed independently of the other viral proteins. Otherwise, V was not found in virions, was not strongly associated with viral nucleocapsids like P, and anti-V had no effect on viral RNA synthesis in vitro under conditions where anti-P was highly inhibitory. The available evidence suggests that V may playa role in RNA synthesis, but it is not an essential one like that of the P protein.",1
"Two tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)derived replicons, created by deletion of most of the 126/183-kDa open reading frame (ORF), replicated and systemically invaded tobacco plants when supported by wild type TMV. One RNA replicon contained an internal direct repeat of 476 nucleotides from the 3′ end of the 30-kDa ORF. Although this RNA was replicated, most of the progeny were heterogeneous in size and smaller than the original transcript. A second TMV-derived RNA replicon, without any internally repeated sequences and containing a deletion of the 5′ portion of the 30-kDa ORF as well as most of the 126/183-kDa ORF, was created and coinoculated with wild type TMV as helper. This RNA also was replicated efficiently and systemically invaded tobacco plants. An examination of the sequences of cDNA clones obtained after PCR amplification of the progeny population of this RNA replicon demonstrated that the observed size heterogeneity was due to deletions and insertions adjacent to the artificially created deletion junction. These data demonstrate that a TMV infection is capable of supporting an artificially created RNA replicon, similar to defective interfering RNAs or satellites. However, these dependent RNAs were replicated without noticeably interfering with wild type TMV symptoms or replication.",1
"The genome segment B sequence of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus was determined for both the Jasper and Sp serotypes. The sequences are 2784 and 2630 by long, respectively, and contain a single large open reading frame encoding the VP1 protein, the putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of IPNV. The proteins exhibit an 88% homology with each other, but only 41% with infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) VP1, another member of the Birnaviridae. Despite the low overall homology between the IPNV and IBDV VP1 proteins, homologous regions were detected within the central portion of the proteins. The carboxy-proximal regions of the VP1, which contain very low amino acid homology, displayed evidence of conservation in structural features such as a hydrophilic, highly basic domain. Consensus sequences associated with GTP-binding proteins and RdRps were also detected in VP1. However, unlike the RdRps associated with single-stranded plus RNA viruses, the birnavirus RdRp lacks the Gly-Asp-Asp motif characteristic of this enzyme family.",1
"Polypeptides of the vaccinia virus envelope exposed on the surface were identified by means of sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin as a surface tag. Among surface expressed polypeptides is the 35-kDa antigen, previously designated Ag35. Both monoclonal (mAb) and monospecific affinity pure antibodies directed against Ag35 neutralized vaccinia infectiousness, indicating that this prominent surface antigen has a function during early virus-host cell interactions. The binding of several monoclonal antibodies to various regions of Ag35 was tested by reacting CNBr fragments, derived from the polypeptide, employing Western blotting. All mAbs tested reacted with the same region of Ag35. Estimation of the molecular weights (MW), based on migration of the CNBr peptides in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, revealed that those partial digestion products which contained a proline-rich 99 amino acid limit digest fragment were present at a position approximately 12.5 kDa larger than that predicted from the DNA sequence. By contrast, partial and limit digest products lacking the proline-rich fragment migrated to the MW position expected from the length of the DNA sequence. This observation demonstrates that departure from a predicted 22.3 kDa to an anomalous MW of Ag35 is conferred by the proline-rich peptide. The surface location of Ag35 was confirmed by immune electron microscopy. In a competition test the binding specificity of mAb and affinity-purified antibodies at the surface of virions could be demonstrated. Evidence for an association of Ag35 with the virus envelope at various stages during biogenesis of vaccinia was obtained by immune electron microscopy of whole mounts and thin sections. Presence of Ag35 as an early component of immature and mature virions, probably residing in the bilayer membrane structure was detected. A distinction can, therefore, be made between Ag35 and several other vaccinia envelope polypeptides which are synthesized as late functions and added during late stages of envelope assembly.",1
"Human CD4 was expressed on a range of mammalian cell lines. CD4+ non-primate cells, derived from rat, hamster, mink, cat, and rabbit, bind recombinant gp120 of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) but are resistant to HIV-1 infection. CD4 expression on various human, rhesus, and African green monkey cell lines confers differential susceptibilities for HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency (SIV) strains. For example, CD4+TE671 rhabdomyosarcoma cells are sensitive to HIV-1 and HIV-2 but resistant to SIV, whereas CD4+ U87 glioma cells are resistant to HIV-1 infection but sensitive to HIV-2 and SIV. HIV-1 infection was not dependent on human major histocompatibility class I expression. Studies of cell fusion and of infection by vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotypes bearing HIV-1 and HIV-2 envelopes showed that the differential cell tropisms of HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV are determined at the cell surface.",1
"A small group of 1.2-kb RNAs present on polyribosoes from clover yellow mosaic virus (CYMV)-infected tissue contains sequences from the genomic RNA (gRNA) of CYMV and is encapsidated by CYMV coat protein. Some features of these RNAs suggest that they are similar to defective interfering (DI) RNAs, and would be the first to be reported for the potexvirus group. The prototype 1.2-kb RNA is 1172 nucleotides in length excluding a probable poly(A) tail and is composed of two noncontiguous regions corresponding to 757 nucleotides of the 5′ and 415 nucleotides of the 3′ terminal of CYMV's gRNA. The sequence of the prototype 1.2-kb RNA reveals that the two terminal gRNA regions present in this RNA encode a single open reading frame (ORF) joining the N-terminus of the 191-kDa nonstructural product and the C-terminus of the coat protein to form a 35-kDa 191-kDa/coat protein fusion product. The coding properties of this prototype RNA have been confirmed by translation in vitro of native and synthetic transcripts of the 1.2-kb RNAs, both of which direct the synthesis of the anticipated 35-kDa product which reacts with anti-CYMV antiserum. Three additional 1.2-kb RNA species, each of which contains a unique junction site, have been characterized. In all cases, a fusion ORF encoding a 191-kDa/coat protein fusion product is encoded on the RNA. The presence of a fusion ORF in all members of the 1.2-kb RNA species analyzed suggests that maintenance of this ORF may be important for the survival of this class of RNA within the plant. This coding strategy represents a novel property of plant virus defective RNAs.",1
"The hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) membrane glycoprotein is present only in some members of the coronavirus family, including some strains of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). In the JHM strain of MHV, expression of the HE gene is variable and corresponds to the number of copies of a UCUAA pentanucleotide sequence present at the 3′-end of the leader RNA. This copy number varies among MHV strains, depending on their passage history. The JHM isolates with two copies of UCUAA in their leader RNA showed a high level of HE expression, whereas the JHM isolate with three copies had a low-level expression. In this study, the analysis of HE gene expression was extended to other MHV strains. The synthesis of HE mRNA in these viruses also correlates with the copy number of UCUAA in the leader RNA and the particular intergenic sequence preceding the HE gene. In one MHV strain, MHV-1, no detectable HE mRNA was synthesized, despite the presence of a proper transcription initiation signal. This lack of HE mRNA expression was consistent with a leader RNA containing three UCUAA copies. However, mutations and deletions within the coding region of the MHV-1 HE gene have generated a stretch of sequence which resembled the transcriptional initiation motif, and was shown to initiate the synthesis of a novel smaller mRNA. These findings strengthened the theory that interactions between leader RNA and transcriptional initiation sequences regulate MHV subgenomic mRNA transcription. Sequence analysis revealed that most MHV strains, through extensive mutations, deletions, or insertions, have lost the complete HE open reading frame, thus turning HE into a pseudogene. This high degree of variation is unusual as the other three structural proteins (spike, membrane, and nucleocapsid) are well-maintained. In contrast to bovine coronavirus, which apparently requires HE for viral replication, the HE protein in MHV may be only an accessory protein which is not necessary for viral replication. JHM and MHV-S, however, have preserved the expression of HE protein.",1
"The pol genes of retroviruses are translated as gag-pol fusion proteins by ribosomal frameshifting within the gag-pol overlap region. During the ribosomal frameshift event, the gag open reading frame is shifted -1 nt to allow in-phase reading of the pol open reading frame. A consensus frameshift signal sequence of GGGAAAC within the gag-pol overlap region of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) has been identified followed by a sequence that has the potential for a pseudoknot tertiary structure. Using recombinant baculoviruses in which the frameshift occurs efficiently, the consensus sequence has been shown to be the site of the frameshift event. A mutation creating a termination codon just downstream of the putative frameshift signal sequence but upstream of the potential pseudoknot structure made a shorter gag product, but did not affect the efficiency of frameshifting. A mutation creating a termination codon just upstream of the putative frameshift signal made a shorter product and essentially abrogated frameshifting. Mutations in the first stem or the second stem in the potential pseudoknot structure severely reduced the frameshifting efficiency. Mutations which altered the length between the frameshift signal and the pseudoknot structure (the so-called spacer region) also reduced the frameshift efficiency. The insertion of a palindromic sequence, which could form a hairpin structure just upstream of the frameshift signal sequence, also affected the frameshifting. These results support the view that the ribosomal frameshift event in the FIV gag-pol region involves the identified signal sequence and appears to require the precisely positioned downstream sequence and indicated pseudoknot structure for efficient frameshifting.",1
"Several biochemical properties and the sequence of the fusion glycoprotein (F) have indicated that turkey rhinotracheitis virus (TRTV) is a pneumovirus, subfamily Pneumovirinae of the Paramyxoviridae family. As TRTV was known to generate polycistronic mRNAs, cDNA was generated from TRTV strain U K/3 BV/85-infected Vero cell mRNAs using an oligonucleotide primer corresponding to a region of the F gene. Sequencing of four cDNAs revealed that the gene adjacent to the beginning (3′ end) of the F gene was that for the matrix (M) protein, i.e., that TRTV had the partial gene order 3′-M-F-5′. This was unexpected as human respiratory syncytial (RS) virus, the type species of the genus Pneumovirus, has the partial gene order 3′-M-SH-G-F-5′, where SH and G are the small hydrophobic protein and attachment glycoprotein, respectively. Instead TRTV resembled the Morbillivirus and Paramyxovirus genera of the Paramyxoviridae (subfamily Paramyxoviridae) which have the partial gene order 3′-M-F-5′. Two further oligonucleotides, one corresponding to a sequence near the end of the M gene and the other (oligo B) to a sequence near the beginning of the F gene, with their 5′ ends spaced 300 nucleotides apart on the basis of the cDNA sequence, were used in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using genomic RNA as template. Only a PCR product of 0.3 kb was obtained. The same sized product was also obtained using these oligonucleotides and genomic RNA from three other TRTV strains (SA/91 /78, UK/8544/85, and SA/2381/88) which had been grown in chicken tracheal organ cultures. In addition PCR was performed using genomic RNA from TRTV-3BV and SA/2381/88 with oligo B and another oligonucleotide near the 5′ end of the gene upstream from M, spaced 1141 nucleotides apart on the basis of the sequence data. Only a 1.14-kb PCR product was obtained. Larger products would have been expected if another gene had been situated between M and F. The absence of such larger products, plus the demonstration that infected cells contained M-F dicistronic mRNAs, supported the conclusion that in the TRTV genome the M gene is adjacent to the F gene in the order 3'-M-F-5′. The 5′ termini of the M and F mRNAs were confirmed by mRNA mapping. The TRTV M gene encoded a protein of 254 amino acids, very similar to that of RS virus (256 residues; 37% amino acid identity) but very different from that of the morbilliviruses and paramyxoviruses (approximately 350 residues). Thus, on the basis of the sequences of both the M and the F genes, TRTV is more closely related to the pneumoviruses than to the paramyxoviruses and morbilliviruses.",1
"RNA editing of the human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) phosphoprotein (P) gene was found to occur for the accession of an alternate discontinuous cistron. Editing occurred within a purine-rich sequence (AAUUAAAAAAGGGGG) found at the mRNA nucleotides 791–805. This sequence resembles an HPIV3 consensus transcription termination sequence and is located at the 5′-end of the putative D protein coding sequences. Editing at an alternate site (AAUUGGAAAGGAAAGG), mRNA nucleotides 1121–1136, for accession of a conserved V cistron, which is present in a number of paramyxovirus P genes, was not found to occur in HPIV3. In contrast with many other paramyxoviruses, editing was indiscriminate with the insertion of 1–12 additional G residues not present in the gene template. RNA editing was found to occur in both in vivo (HPIV3 infected cells) and in vitro (purified nucleocapsid complexes) synthesized mRNAs. Further, the in vitro prepared mRNA was edited regardless of whether the nucleocapsid complexes were transcribed in the presence or absence of uninfected human lung carcinoma (HLC) cell lysates. These results support the notion that RNA editing appears to be exclusively a function of viral proteins.",1
"The open reading frame potentially encoding a 78 amino acid, 9101 Da hydrophobic protein (HP) and, mapping at the 3′ end of the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) genome, was shown to be expressed during virus replication. The cloned HP gene was placed in a plasmid under control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and in vitro translation of transcripts generated in vitro yielded a 9.1-kDa protein that was immunoprecipitable with porcine hyperimmune anti-TGEV serum. Antiserum raised in rabbits against a 31 amino acid synthetic polypeptide that represented the central hydrophilic region of HP specifically immunoprecipitated HP from TGEV-infected cells. HP was further shown to become associated with microsomal membranes during synthesis in vitro and was found to be closely associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and cell surface membranes in infected cells. The intracellular location of HP suggests that it may play a role in the membrane association of replication complexes or in virion assembly.",1
"Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus, causes encephalitis and demyelination in susceptible rodents. Previous investigations have shown that the MHV spike (S) protein is a critical determinant of viral tropism and pathogenicity in mice and rats. To understand the molecular basis of MHV neuropathogenesis, we studied the spike protein gene sequences of several neutralization-resistant variants of the JHM strain of MHV, which were selected with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for the S protein. We found that variant 2.2-V-1, which was selected with MAb J.2.2 and primarily caused demyelination, had a single point mutation at nucleotide (NT) 3340, as compared to the parental JHM virus, which predominantly caused encephalitis. This site was in the S2 subunit of the S protein. In contrast, variant 7.2-V-1, which was selected with MAb J.7.2 and primarily caused encephalitis, had two point mutations at NT 1766 and 1950, which were in the S1 subunit. Finally, the double mutant 2.2/7.2-V-2, which was selected with both MAbs J.2.2 and J.7.2, and was attenuated with respect to both virulence and the ability to cause demyelination, had a deletion spanning from NT 1523 to 1624 in the S1 and a point mutation at NT 3340 in the S2. We conclude that at least two regions of the S protein contribute to neuropathogenicity of MHV. We have also isolated a partial revertant of 2.2-V-1, which was partially resistant to MAb 1.2.2 but retained the same neuropathogenicity as the variant 2.2-V-1. This revenant retained the mutation at NT 3340, but had a second-site mutation at NT 1994, further confirming that NT 3340 contributed to the pathogenic phenotype of MHV. By comparing these results with MHV variants isolated in other laboratories, which had mutations in other sites on the S gene and yet retained the demyelinating ability, we suggest that the ability of JHM viruses to induce demyelination is determined by the interaction of multiple sites on the S gene, rather than the characteristics of a single, unique site. Our study also revealed the possible presence of microheterogeneity of S gene sequence, particularly in the S1 region, in these viruses. The sequence microheterogeneity may also contribute to the differences in their biological properties.",1
"We have previously shown that cells infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) bind rabbit, mouse, and rat IgG by the Fc portion of the IgG molecule. This Fc-binding activity appeared to be mediated by the MHV S protein. S protein could also be precipitated from MHV-infected cells by a monoclonal antibody directed against the murine Fc γ receptor (FcγR). To prove definitively that the S protein mediates Fc-binding activity, we have expressed the MHV S protein utilizing recombinant vaccinia viruses. The anti-FcγR monoclonal antibody, 2.4G2, precipitated recombinant S protein in cells of murine, human, and rabbit origin. Since the anti-Fc receptor monoclonal antibody does not react with human and rabbit Fc receptors these results demonstrate that the epitope recognized by this antibody is carried on the MHV S protein and is not murine in origin. Examination of various MHV isolates and escape mutants failed to identify the precise sequences in S responsible for the molecular mimicry of the murine FcγR. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that a previously identified region of similarity between the S protein and the FcγR mediates this activity. The Fc binding activity of S was expressed on the cell surface, since MHV-JHM-infected cells, but not uninfected cells, formed rosettes with anti-sheep red blood cell (SRBC) antibody-coated SRBC. The anti-FcγR monoclonal antibody neutralized MHV-JHM and inhibited syncytium formation induced by the MHV S protein.",1
"The complete nucleotide sequences of the hemagglutinin/esterase (HE) genes of human coronavirus (HCV) strain OC43 and bovine respiratory coronavirus (BRCV) strain G95 were determined from single-stranded cDNA fragments generated by reverse transcription of virus-specific mRNAs and amplified by polymerase chain reaction. An open reading frame of 1272 nucleotides was identified as the putative HE gene by homology to the bovine coronavirus HE gene. This open reading frame encodes a protein of 424 amino acids with an estimated molecular weight of 47.7 kDa. Ten potential N-linked glycosylation sites were predicted in the HE protein of HCV-OC43 while nine of them were present in BRCV-G95. Fourteen cysteine residues were conserved in the HE proteins of both viruses. Two hydrophobic sequences at the N-terminus and the C-terminus may serve as signal peptide and transmembrane anchoring domain, respectively. The predicted HE protein of HCV-OC43 was 95% identical to the HEs of BRCV-G95 and other bovine coronaviruses, and 60% identical to the HEs of mouse hepatitis viruses. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the HE genes of coronaviruses and influenza C virus have a common ancestral origin, and that bovine coronaviruses and HCV-OC43 are closely related.",1
"The second smallest subgenomic messenger RNA, mRNA5, of the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus includes in its “5′ unique region” two separate open reading frames (5a and 5b), whose coding function has not so far been established, and thus it may represent a dicistronic messenger RNA. We report here that two polypeptides with the sizes expected for the 5a and 5b products can be synthesised by in vitro translation of a single artificial mRNA containing both the 5a and 5b ORFs. To establish whether these polypeptides represent genuine virus gene products, both the 5a and 5b coding sequences were expressed as bacterial fusion proteins, and these were used to raise monospecific antisera. Antisera raised against both the 5a and 5b-specific sequences recognized specifically proteins of the expected size in infectious bronchitis virus-infected chicken kidney and Vero cells, indicating that 5a and 5b do represent genuine virus genes, and suggesting that mRNA5 is indeed functionally dicistronic.",1
"The genomic organization at the 3′ end of canine coronavirus (CCV) and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) was determined by sequence analysis and compared to that of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of swine. Comparison of the latter two has previously revealed an extra open reading frame (ORF) at the 3′ end of the FIPV genome, lacking in TGEV, which is currently designated ORF 6b. Both CCV and FECV possess 6b-related ORFs at the 3′ ends of their genomes. The presence of ORF 6b in three of four viruses in this antigenic cluster strongly suggests that TGEV has lost this ORF by deletion. The CCV ORF 6b is collinear with that of FIPV, but the predicted amino acid sequences are only 58% identical. The FECV ORF 6b contains a large deletion compared to that of FIPV, reducing the collinear part to 60%. The sequence homologies were highest between CCV and TGEV on the one hand and between FECV and FIPV on the other. Previously, we showed that the expression product of the FIPV ORF 6b can be detected in infected cells by immunoprecipitation (Vennema et al., 1992). In the present study we have performed similar experiments with CCV and FECV. In infected cells both viruses produced proteins related to but different from the FIPV 6b protein.",1
"Two cytopathogenic isolates of bovine viral diarrhea virus (cpBVDV) have been analyzed. For both viruses two regions of their genomic RNAs were found to be duplicated and rearranged. The viral genomes contain a small duplicated element (SD) derived from the genomic 5' end far downstream of its original context. This sequence is followed by a larger duplication which encompasses the region coding for the protein p80(LD), a molecular marker for cpBVDV. The SD element codes for the viral protease p20. In the case of the viruses analyzed here the aminoterminus of p80 is generated by autoproteolytic removal of the preceding SD-encoded protease. For one of the cpBVDV isolates a specific fusion protein (p28) could be identified which is composed of p20 and part of p10, another viral protein. Molecular characterization of the respective noncytopathogenic counterpart revealed that duplication and rearrangement of sequences as well as the expression of p28 and p80 are specific for the cytopathogenic virus.",1
"Total RNA extracted from both white and gray matter of brain tissue from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and controls was analyzed using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for the presence of the nucleic acid of human coronavirus (HCV) 229E and OC43, the two strains characterized to date and associated with respiratory infections. HCV-229E viral RNA was detectable in the central nervous system tissue of 4 of 11 MS patients and in none of 6 neurological and 5 normal controls. No HCV-OC43 nucleic acid was detected in any of the specimens. These results suggest a neurotropism on the part of the 229E strain of human coronavirus and underline the importance of further studies on its tissue distribution. The fact that it was detected only in tissue from MS patients illustrates the need for continued studies on the possible role of coronaviruses in the etiology of MS.",1
"The cellular receptors for a coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), have been recently identified as one or more members of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family. The neurotropic JHM strain of MHV (MHV-JHM) possesses a highly fusogenic surface (S) glycoprotein. This protein is now shown to promote the spread of MHV into cells lacking the specific CEA-related MHV receptor. Resistant cells are recruited into MHV-induced syncytium with consequent production of progeny virus. Cell-to-cell spread of virus via membrane fusion without the requirement for specific cell surface receptor offers a novel way for virus to spread within infected hosts.",1
"Using 11 overlapping synthetic peptides covering more than 95% of the amino acid sequence of capsid protein of rubella virus, 7 CD4+ T cell clones (R10, R11, R18, A2, A10, A1, and A12) isolated from 2 rubella seropositive donors reacted strongly to rubella capsid peptides C6 (residues 119–152), C9 (residues 205–233), or C11 (residues 255–280), respectively, in both proliferation and cytotoxicity assay. Truncated peptides C6E (residues 125–139), C9B (residues 205–216), and C11E (residues 260–272) were shown to be involved directly to the T cell determinants of C6, C9, and C11, respectively. Genetic restriction of these T cell clones was analyzed by using human cell lines with various HLA-DR phenotypes as targets and/or antigen-presenting cells in cytotoxicity assay and/or proliferation assays. The results indicated that the recognition of peptide C6 by T cell clones (R11 and R18) was associated with DRw9 molecule, while the HLA restriction element of the responses of other T cell clones (A2 and A11, A10, and A12) that reacted with peptide C9 or C11 was DR4 molecule. However, there may be a cross-recognition by the T cell clone (A12) between DR1 and DR4 subtypes.",1
"A combination of comparative sequence analysis and thermodynamic methods reveals the conservation of tertiary structure elements in the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of human enteroviruses and rhinoviruses. The predicted common structural elements occur in the 3′ end of a segment that is critical for internal ribosome binding, termed “ribosome landing pad” (RLP), of polioviruses. Base pairings between highly conserved 17-nucleotide (nt) and 21-nt sequences in the 5′ UTR of human enteroviruses and rhinoviruses constitute a predicted pseudoknot that is significantly more stable than those that can be formed from a large set of randomly shuffled sequences. A conserved single-stranded polypyrimidine tract is located between two conserved tertiary elements. R. Nicholson, J. Pelletier, S.-Y. Le, and N. Sonenberg (1991, J. Virol. 65, 5886–5894) demonstrated that the point mutations of 3-nt UUU out of an essential 4-nt pyrimidine stretch sequence UUUC abolished translation. Structural analysis of the mutant sequence indicates that small point mutations within the short polypyrimidine sequence would destroy the tertiary interaction in the predicted, highly ordered structure. The proposed common tertiary structure can offer experimentalists a model upon which to extend the interpretations for currently available data. Based on these structural features possible base-pairing models between human enteroviruses and 18 S rRNA and between human rhinoviruses and 18 S rRNA are proposed. The proposed common structure implicates a biological function for these sequences in translational initiation.",1
"To study the role of the precursor to the membrane protein (prM) in flavivirus maturation, we inhibited the proteolytic processing of the Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) virus prM to membrane protein in infected cells by adding the acidotropic agent ammonium chloride late in the virus replication cycle. Viruses purified from supernatants of ammonium chloride-treated cells contained prM protein and were unable to fuse C6/36 mosquito cells from without. When ammonium chloride was removed from the cells, both the processing of prM and the fusion activity of the purified viruses were partially restored. By using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for the envelope (E) glycoprotein of MVE virus, we found that at least three epitopes were less accessible to their corresponding antibodies in the prM-containing MVE virus particles. Amino-terminal sequencing of proteolytic fragments of the E protein which were reactive with sequence-specific peptide antisera or MAb enabled us to estimate the site of the E protein interacting with the prM to be within amino acids 200 to 327. Since prM-containing viruses were up to 400-fold more resistant to a low pH environment, we conclude that the E-prM interaction might be necessary to protect the E protein from irreversible conformational changes caused by maturation into the acidic vesicles of the exocytic pathway.",1
"The nonstructural polyproteins of Sindbis virus are processed by a virus-encoded proteinase which is located in the C-terminal domain of nsP2. Here we have performed a mutagenic analysis to identify the active site residues of this proteinase. Substitution of other amino acids for either Cys-481 or His-558 completely abolished proteolytic processing of Sindbis virus polyproteins in vitro. Substitutions within this domain for a second cysteine conserved among alphaviruses, for four other conserved histidines, or for a conserved serine did not affect the activity of the enzyme. These results suggest that nsP2 is a papain-like proteinase whose catalytic dyad is composed of Cys-481 and His-558. Since an asparagine residue has been implicated in the active site of papain, we changed the four conserved asparagine residues in the C-terminal half of nsP2 and found that all could be substituted without total loss of activity. Among papain-like proteinases, the residue following the catalytic histidine is alanine or glycine in the plant and animal enzymes, and the presence of Trp-559 in alphaviruses is unusual. A mutant enzyme containing Ala-559 was completely inactive, implying that Trp-559 is essential for a functional proteinase. All of these mutations were introduced into a full-length clone of Sindbis virus from which infectious RNA could be transcribed in vitro, and the effects of these changes on viability were tested. In all cases it was found that mutations which abolished proteolytic activity were lethal, whether or not these mutations were in the catalytic residues, indicating that proteolysis of the nonstructural polyprotein is essential for Sindbis replication.",1
"Sequence analysis revealed that rice dwarf phytoreovirus segment S12 is 1066 nucleotides long with a small out-of-phase, overlapping open reading frame (ORF) as well as a major ORF. The large ORF (positions 42 to 980) encodes 312 amino acids, while the small one (bases 313 to 591) encodes 92 amino acids with an additional in-frame AUG codon (positions 337–339) 24 nucleotides downstream from the first one. Transcripts from a full-length cDNA directed the in vitro synthesis of three polypeptides of 33 (considered to be translated from the long ORF), 8, and 7 kDa. Alteration of each of the two ATG codons on the small ORF demonstrated their involvement in the generation of the 8- and 7-kDa polypeptides. Although it is still unknown whether these proteins are expressed in vivo, the small ORF is shown to be conserved in S9s of two other members of the genus Phytoreovirus, rice gall dwarf virus and wound tumor virus, suggesting its common, important function.",1
"Following intracerebral inoculation of adult Balb/c Byj mice, the MHV-4 strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) had an LD50 of <0.1 PFU, whereas its monoclonal antibody resistant variant V5A13.1 had an LD50 of 104.2 PFU. To determine the basis for this difference in neurovirulence we have studied the acute central nervous system (CNS) infection of these two viruses by in situ hybridization. Both viruses infected the same, specific neuroanatomical areas, predominantly neurons, and spread via the cerebrospinal fluid, along neuronal pathways and between adjacent cells. The neuronal nuclei infected and the spread of virus within the brain are described. The main difference between the parental and variant viruses was the rate at which the infection spread. MHV-4 spread rapidly, destroying large numbers of neurons and the animals died within 4 days of infection. The variant virus spread to the same areas of the brain but at a slower rate. This difference in the rate of virus spread was also apparent from the brain virus titers. The slower rate of spread of the variant virus appears to allow intervention by the immune response. Consistent with this, the variant virus spread slowly in athymic nu/nu mice, but in the absence of an intact immune response, infection and destruction of neurons eventually reached the same extent as that of the parental virus and the mice died within 6 days of infection. We conclude that the V5A13.1 variant of MHV-4 is neuroattenuated by its slower rate of spread in the CNS.",1
"The lymphocyte proliferative response to mouse hepatitis virus, strain JHM (MHV-JHM), a well-described cause of chronic and acute neurological infections, has been studied using vaccinia virus recombinants expressing individual MHV proteins. The surface (S) and transmembrane (M) glycoproteins were the most active proteins in causing proliferation of lymphocytes isolated from immunized adult mice, whereas lymphocytes from persistently infected mice proliferated only in response to the S protein. The cells from immunized mice which proliferated most actively in response to MHV were positive for the CD4 antigen and secreted interferon-γ. In addition, the most responsive subset of cells did not express gpg0MEL-14, the lymph node-specific homing receptor. The results identify a subpopulation of CD4+ T cells that may be an important component of the cell-mediated immune response to this virus. The data also suggest that response to the M protein is important in preventing disease progression in C57BL/6 mice since cells which recognize this protein are absent from persistently infected mice.",1
"A comparison of the sequence of the dengue-2 16681 virus with that of the candidate vaccine strain (16681-PDK53) derived from it identified 53 of the 10,723 nucleotides which differed between the strains. Nucleotide changes occurred in genes coding for all virion and nonvirion proteins, and in the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions. Twenty-seven of the nucleotide changes resulted in amino acid alterations. The greatest amino acid sequence differences in the virion proteins occurred in prM (2.20%; 2 91 amino acids) followed by the M protein (1.33%; 1 75 amino acids), the C protein (0.88%; 1 114 amino acid), and the E protein (0.61%; 3 495 amino acids). Differences in the amino acid sequence of nonvirion proteins ranged from 1.51% ( 6 398 amino acids) in NS4 to 0.33% ( 3 900 amino acids) in NS5. The encoded protein sequences of 16681-PDK53 were also compared with the published sequences of other flaviviruses to obtain a detailed classification of 17 flaviviruses using the neighbor-joining tree method. The analyses of the sequence data produced dendrograms which supported the traditional groupings based on serological evidence, and they suggested that the flaviviruses have evolved by divergent mutational change and there was no evidence of genetic recombination between members of the group. Comparisons of the sequences of the flavivirus polymerase and helicase-like proteins (NS5 and NS3, respectively) with those from other viruses yielded a classification of the flaviviruses indicating that the primary division of the flaviviruses was between those transmitted by mosquitoes and those transmitted by ticks.",1
"The oligomerization state of the rabies virus envelope glycoprotein (G protein) was determined using electron microscopy and sedimentation analysis of detergent solubilized G. Most of the detergents used in this study solubilized G in a 4 S monomeric form. However, when CHAPS was used, G had a sedimentation coefficient of 9 S. This high sedimentation coefficient allowed its further separation from M1 and M2. Using electron microscopy of negatively stained samples, we studied the morphology of G on virus and after detergent extraction. End-on views of G on virus clearly showed triangles consisting of three dots indicating the trimeric nature of native G. End-on views of CHAPS-isolated G showed very similar triangles confirming that, using this detergent, G was solubilized in its native trimeric structure. Electron microscopy also showed that G had a “head” and a “stalk” and provided the basis for a low-resolution model of the glycoprotein structure.",1
"The coding potential of the open reading frame ORF4 (82 amino acids) of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) has been confirmed by expression using a baculovirus vector. Five monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) raised against the 10K recombinant product immunoprecipitated a polypeptide of a similar size in TGEV-infected cells. Immunofluorescence assays performed both on insect and mammalian cells revealed that ORF4 was a membrane-associated protein, a finding consistent with the prediction of a membrane-spanning segment in ORF4 sequence. Two epitopes were localized within the last 21 C-terminal residues of the sequence through peptide scanning and analysis of the reactivity of a truncated ORF4 recombinant protein. Since the relevant MAbs were found to induce a cell surface fluorescence, these data suggest that ORF4 may be an integral membrane protein having a Cexo-Nendo orientation. Anti-ORF4 MAbs were also used to show that ORF4 polypeptide may be detected in TGEV virion preparations, with an estimated number of 20 molecules incorporated per particle. Comparison of amino acid sequence data provided strong evidence that other coronaviruses encode a polypeptide homologous to TGEV ORF4. Our results led us to propose that ORF4 represents a novel minor structural polypeptide, tentatively designated SM (small membrane protein).",1
"The interaction of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) with erythrocytes was analyzed. The binding activity of IBV was not sufficient to agglutinate chicken erythrocytes. However, it acquired hemagglutinating activity after treatment with neuraminidase to remove α2,3-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid from the surface of the virion. Pretreatment of erythrocytes with neuraminidase rendered the cells resistant to agglutination by IBV. Susceptibility to agglutination was restored by resialylation of asialo-erythrocytes to contain α2,3-linked sialic acid. These results indicate that IBV attaches to receptors on erythrocytes, the crucial determinant of which is sialic acid α2,3-linked to galactose. In contrast to other enveloped viruses with such a binding specificity (influenza viruses and paramyxoviruses) IBV lacks a receptor-destroying enzyme.",1
"Mouse hepatitis virus has been shown to undergo RNA recombination at high frequency during mixed infection. Temperature-sensitive mutants were isolated using 5-fluorouracil and 5-azacytidine as mutagen. Six RNA+ mutants that reside within a single complementation group mapping within the S glycoprotein gene of MHV-A59 were isolated which did not cause syncytium at the restrictive temperature. Using standard genetic techniques, a recombination map was established that indicated that these mutants mapped into two distinct domains designated F1 and F2. These genetic domains may correspond to mutations mapping within the S1 and S2 glycoproteins, respectively, and suggest that both the S1 and S2 domains are important in eliciting the fusogenic activity of the S glycoprotein gene. In addition, assuming that most distal is alleles map roughly 4.0 kb apart, a recombination frequency of 1 % per 575–676 by was predicted through the S glycoprotein gene. Interestingly, this represents a threefold increase in the recombination frequency as compared to rates predicted through the polymerase region. The increase in the recombination rate was probably not due to recombination events resulting in large deletions or insertions (>50 bp), but rather was probably due to a combination of homologous and nonhomologous recombination. A variety of explanations could account for the increased rates of recombination in the S gene.",1
"Infection of mice with the JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) results in an acute encephalomyelitis associated with primary demyelination of the central nervous system. Efforts at understanding the components of the immune response in the development of chronic MHV-induced demyelination have implicated the antibody response and both the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. In this report, we demonstrate that Balb/c (H-2°) mice immunized with the JHM (JHMV) strain of MHV develop a CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response. One population of these virus-specific CTL recognize the nucleocapsid (N) protein. Recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing either the entire N protein or carboxy-terminal deletions were used to determine the number and location of the epitope(s) recognized. The CTLs were found to recognize a peptide contained within the carboxy-terminal 149 amino acids of the N protein. Analysis of infected cell lines expressing transfected major histocompatibility genes demonstrated that the anti-N protein CTLs were restricted exclusively to the L° molecule. These data provide the first definition of a MHV-specific CTL response directed to a viral protein and suggest that the anti-N protein CTL response is one potential mechanism used by the host to clear JHMV from the central nervous system.",1
"Several polypeptide products of MHV-A59 ORF 1a were characterized in MHV-A59 infected DBT cells, using antisera directed against fusionn roteins encoded in the first 6.5 kb of ORF1a. These included the previously identified N-terminal ORF 1a product, p28, as well as 290-, 240-, and 50-kDa polypeptides. P28 was always detected as a discrete band without larger precursors, suggesting rapid cleavage of p28 immediately after its synthesis. Once p28 was cleaved there was little degradation of the protein over a 2-hr period. The intracellular cleavage of p28 was not inhibited by the protease inhibitor leupeptin, in contrast to results obtained during in vitro translation of genome RNA (Denison and Perlman, 1986). These data suggest that different protease activities may be responsible for the cleavage of p28 in vitro and in vivo. The 290-kDa protein was an intermediate cleavage product derived from a precursor of greater than 400 kDa. The 290-kDa product was subsequently cleaved into secondary products of 50 and 240 kDa. The intracellular cleavage of the 290-kDa polypeptide was inhibited by leupeptin at concentrations which did not inhibit the early cleavage of p28 or the cleavage of the 290-kDa product from its larger polyprotein precursor. In the presence of zinc chloride, a product of >320 kDa was detected, which appears to incorporate p28 at its amino terminus. This suggests that at least two protease activities may be necessary for processing of ORF1a proteins, one of which cleaves p28 and is sensitive to zinc chloride but resistant to leupeptin, and the other which cleaves the 290-kDa precursor and is sensitive to both inhibitors. Both the 290- and 240-kDa proteins should contain sequences predicted to encode two papain-like protease activities.",1
"From strain JHB/1/66 of influenza C virus a mutant was derived with a change in the cell tropism. The mutant was able to grow in a subline of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK II) which is resistant to infection by the parent virus due to a lack of receptors. Inactivation of cellular receptors by either neuraminidase or acetylesterase and generation of receptors by resialylation of cells with N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2) indicated that 9-O-acetylated sialic acid is a receptor determinant for both parent and mutant virus. However, the mutant required less Neu5,9Ac2 on the cell surface for virus attachment than the parent virus. The increased binding efficiency enabled the mutant to infect cells with a low content of 9-O-acetylated sialic acid which were resistant to the parent virus. By comparing the nucleotide sequences of the glycoprotein (HEF) genes of the parent and the mutant virus only a single point mutation could be identified on the mutant gene. This mutation at nucleotide position 872 causes an amino acid exchange from threonine to isoleucine at position 284 on the amino acid sequence. Sequence similarity with a stretch of amino acids involved in the receptor-binding pocket of the influenza A hemagglutinin suggests that the mutation site on the influenza C glycoprotein (HEF) is part of the receptor-binding site.",1
"A group of 11 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) raised against transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was used to study the antigenic structure of the virus nucleoprotein (N). To identify the regions recognized by MAbs, DNA fragments derived from the N-coding region of the TGEV strain FS772/70 were cloned into pUR expression plasmids and the antigenicity of the resulting fusion proteins was analyzed by immunobloting. A major antigenic domain was identified, covering the first 241 amino acid residues of N, within which an epitope (residues 57–117) was also found. A second antigenic domain extended from residues 175 to 360 of the nucleoprotein, within which a subsite was characterized within the region covering residues 241–349. MAb DA3 recognized a linear epitope which mapped within residues 360 and 382 at the carboxy terminus of the nucleoprotein. The binding of the majority of the MAbs (8 out of 11) to large fusions, but not to smaller fragments included in them, suggests a conformational dependence of the MAb binding sites. Our data show that the use of fusions in Western blot experiments is a useful approach to map not only linear epitopes but more complex antigenic structures found in the nucleoprotein of TGEV.",1
"Two species of primates, Owl and African green monkeys, were inoculated intracerebrally with either the neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus JHM or the putative multiple sclerosis brain coronavirus isolate SD. These viruses caused an acute to subacute panencephalitis and/or demyelination in the infected animals. The course of pathogenesis and sites of detected viral RNA and antigen was dependent both on animal species and virus strain but the results clearly showed that these viruses replicated and disseminated in the central nervous system (CNS) of these primates. This study suggests that human CNS may be susceptible to coronavirus infection.",1
"The mRNA synthesis of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) has been proposed to be the result of interaction between the leader RNA and the intergenic sites. Previously, we have identified a transcription initiation site (for mRNA 2-1), which is more efficiently transcribed by viruses containing two copies of UCUAA sequence in the leader RNA than by those with three copies. In this study, we have identified several sites which are regulated in the opposite way, namely, they are efficiently transcribed by the leader RNA with three UCUAA copies but not by those with two copies. These sites were characterized by primer extension and amplification by polymerase chain reaction. One of these sites is in the gene 3 region of a recombinant virus between A59 and JHM strains of MHV. Another is in the gene 2 region of MHV-1 strain. Both of these sites have a sequence similar to but different from the consensus transcription initiation signal (UCUAAUCUAUC and UUUAAUCUU, as opposed to UCUAAAC). These two novel intergenic sequences are not present in the genome of the JHM strain, consistent with the absence of these mRNAs in the JHM-infected cells. The discovery of this type of transcription initiation site provides additional evidence for the importance of the leader RNA in the transcription initiation of MHV mRNAs.",1
"A DNA copy of DI RNA of cymbidium ringspot tombusvirus was cloned downstream of a phage T7 promoter. In vitro-transcribed RNA replicated in Nicotiana clevelandii when coinoculated with full-length viral genomic RNA transcripts and protected plants from apical necrosis. Artificial deletion mutants derived from the DI RNA clone showed that most of the central sequence block is necessary for replication. Hybrid DI RNA-satRNA clones were prepared and in vitro-synthesized RNA was inoculated to plants in the presence of helper viral RNA. There was replication only of in vitro transcripts derived from hybrid clones where satRNA sequences were inserted upstream or downstream from the central block, but not of those derived from clones where satRNA sequence replaced the central block. Progeny RNA of biologically active clones was either full-length or showed deletions depending on the insertion of satRNA sequences in DI RNA. DI RNA-satRNA constructs having part of the 5′ region exchanged were not replicated.",1
"Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is an enteropathogenic coronavirus isolated for the first time in 1946. Nonenteropathogenic porcine respiratory coronaviruses (PRCVs) have been derived from TGEV. The genetic relationship among six European PRCVs and five coronaviruses of the TGEV antigenic cluster has been determined based on their RNA sequences. The S protein of six PRCVs have an identical deletion of 224 amino acids starting at position 21. The deleted area includes the antigenic sites C and B of TGEV S glycoprotein. Interestingly, two viruses (NEB72 and TOY56) with respiratory tropism have S proteins with a size similar to the enteric viruses. NEB72 and TOY56 viruses have in the S protein 2 and 15 specific amino acid differences with the enteric viruses. Four of the residues changed (aa 219 of NEB72 isolate and as 92, 94, and 218 of TOY56) are located within the deletion present in the PRCVs and may be involved in the receptor binding site (RBS) conferring enteric tropism to TGEVs. A second RBS used by the virus to infect ST cells might be located in a conserved area between sites A and D of the S glycoprotein, since monoclonal antibodies specific for these sites inhibit the binding of the virus to ST cells. An evolutionary tree relating 13 enteric and respiratory isolates has been proposed. According to this tree, a main virus lineage evolved from a recent progenitor virus which was circulating around 1941. From this, secondary lineages originated PUR46, NEB72, TOY56, MIL65, BR170, and the PRCVs, in this order. Least squares estimation of the origin of TGEV-related coronaviruses showed a significant constancy in the fixation of mutations with time, that is, the existence of a well-defined molecular clock. A mutation fixation rate of 7 ± 2 × 10−4 nucleotide substitutions per site and per year was calculated for TGEV-related viruses. This rate falls in the range reported for other RNA viruses. Point mutations and probably recombination events have occurred during TGEV evolution.",1
"The major glycoprotein complex gl of bovine herpesvirus-1 was expressed at high levels (36 μg per 1 × 106 cells) in insect cells using a recombinant baculovirus. The recombinant gl had an apparent molecular weight of 116 kDa and was partially cleaved to yield 63-kDa (glb) and 52-kDa (glc) subunits. This processing step was significantly less efficient in insect cells than the analogous step in mammalian cells, even though the cleavage sites of authentic and recombinant gl were shown to be identical. The oligosaccharide linkages were mostly endoglycosidase-H-sensitive, in contrast to those of authentic gl, which has mostly endoglycosidase-H-resistant linkages and an apparent molecular weight of 130/74/55 kDa. Despite the reduced cleavage and altered glycosylation, the recombinant glycoprotein was transported and expressed on the surface of infected insect cells. These surface molecules were biologically active as demonstrated by their ability to induce cell-cell fusion. Fusion was inhibited bythree monoclonal antibodies specific for antigenic domains I and IV on gl. Domain I maps to the extracellular region of the carboxy terminal fragment glc and domain IV to the very amino terminus of the glb fragment, indicating that domains mapping in two distinct regions of gl function in cell fusion. Monoclonal antibodies specific for eight different epitopes recognized recombinant gl, indicating that the antigenic characteristics of the recombinant and authentic glycoproteins are similar. In addition, the recombinant gl was as immunogenic as the authentic gl, resulting in the induction of gl-specific antibodies in cattle.",1
"Three different methods were compared for their efficiency at detection of adenoviruses. The samples examined for viral analysis consisted of concentrates prepared from raw sewage, chosen as providing a representation of the spectrum of viruses being intestinally shed from a large population at any given time. When using one single cell line, HEp-2, the overall numbers of adenoviruses detected using cytopathogenicity and immunofluorescence were roughly equal. In situ hybridization was approx. 40% more sensitive than either of these other methods as determined by average virus titers for the different samples, and also proved to be better by means of a nonparametric comparison. The 293 cell line was approx. 5 times more sensitive for detecting adenoviruses by cytopathogenicity as compared with the HEp-2 cell line, but proved unsuitable in our hands for quantitatively detecting indigenous adenoviruses by immunofluorescence. The relative number of indigenous adenoviruses present in the sewage concentrates we examined was, on average, 94-fold greater than that of enteroviruses. Assay of enteroviruses was performed by plaque assay in the BGM cell line.",1
"The documentation of several recent outbreaks of human virus diseases associated with the consumption of shellfish has reiterated the threat posed by these agents to the shellfish industry. This article reviews pertinent outbreaks, identifies principal viral agents involved, and delineates systems which may be at greatest risk. The results of two recent laboratory studies which sought to define environmental factors that contribute to virus accumulation by shellfish are also discussed. First, the accumulation of environmentally significant levels of feces-associated and monodispersed poliovirus by oysters (Crassostrea virginica) and clams (Mercenaria mercenaria) was investigated. The results of this study suggested that virus accumulation by mollusks may not be significant when water column concentrations are below ⋍0.01 plaque-forming units (PFU) per milliliter. The second study focused on the relative contributions of undisturbed sediments versus those in the water column in the accumulation of viruses by epifaunal and infaunal shellfish (C. virginica and M. mercenaria). Viruses were found to be most efficiently accumulated when suspended in the water column.",1
"Parasitic, fungal, bacterial and viral diseases of common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) are reviewed. Besides a general overview of parasites of carp, swimbladder inflammation, caused by Sphaerospora spp., is discussed in detail. Saprolegnia spp. is the most important fungal pathogen. Aeromonas hydrophila and the atypical Aeromonas salmonicida, as well as Flexibacter columnaris, are described as the major bacterial pathogens of carp. Spring viraemia of carp caused by Rhabdovirus carpio is presented as the main viral infection of common carp. Details on methods of treatment and prevention are presented together with a description of the given diseases. The role of environmental stress, including “normal” culture practice and pollution, in the outbreak of diseases of common carp is discussed. Prospective methods to minimize the risk of diseases as well as their limitations are presented.",1
"N-Linked protein glycosylation was examined in vitro in dispersed rat parotid acinar cells from young adult (3–6 months) and aged (22–24 months) rats. A small decrease in general protein production was observed with cells from aged animals (∼20% lower incorporation of [14C]leucine into 10% CCI3 COOH insoluble protein during continuous pulse labeling). Incorporation of [3H]mannose into N-linked glycoproteins by aged cells was further reduced (∼35%). Similarly microsomal membranes from parotid glands of aged animals showed ∼50% reduction in the synthesis of mannosylphosphoryl dolichol, a key intermediate in the dolichol pathway of protein N-glycosylation. Man-P-Dol synthase, the microsomal enzyme responsible for production of this saccharide-lipid, displayed no change in apparent K m for GDP-mannose when preparations from aged animals were utilized, but did show ∼50% reduction in V max. Following β-adrenoreceptor activation, cells from both young adult and aged glands showed increased N-linked protein glycosylation almost to the same extent (∼2-fold). The data suggested that in aged rat parotid cells there is a basal reduction of activity in the pathway responsible for asparagine-linked protein glycosylation, but that following exocytotic stimuli this pathway responds in a manner comparable to cells from young adult glands.",1
"An indigenous population of 450–500 beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) inhabiting the St. Lawrence Estuary has been exposed chronically for more than 50 years to a complex mixture of industrial pollutants including organochlorinated compounds (OC), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and heavy metals. From 1983 to 1990, we have necropsied 45 well preserved carcasses out of a total of 120 beluga whales reported dead over this period. Of these 45 animals, nine were affected by 10 malignant neoplasms. Fifteen animals (33%) were affected by pneumonia. Milk production was compromised in eight of 17 mature females (41%), by inflammatory changes (seven animals) and cancer (one animal) which affected the mammary glands. Opportunistic bacteria were found in pure culture, and/or in significant amounts in at least two organs in 20 belugas (44%). The concentrations of both total PCBs and highly chlorinated PCB congeners were much higher in St. Lawrence animals than in Arctic beluga whales. OC-induced immunosuppression has been repeatedly demonstrated in a wide variety of animal species. Therefore, it is probable that the immune functions of St. Lawrence beluga whales are impaired. Benzo[α]pyrene adducts were detected in 10 of the 11 St. Lawrence beluga whales of which tissues (six livers, 10/11 brains) were analyzed by a method based on HPLC. No such adducts were found in four Arctic animals. Since benzo[α]pyrene is one of the most potent chemical carcinogens known to man, these compounds might be responsible for some of the cancers observed in that population. Overall, our findings contrast vividly with those of others who found that cancers are exceedingly rare in free-ranging odontocete populations and that the major causes for mortalities in these populations are bacteria, parasites, and trauma.",1
"This review presents the current state of knowledge on the relationship between the environment and the use of municipal waste compost in terms of health risk assessment. The hazards stem from chemical and microbiological agents whose nature and magnitude depend heavily on the degree of sorting and on the composting methods. Three main routes of exposure can be determined and are quantified in the literature: (i) The ingestion of soil/compost mixtures by children, mostly in cases of pica, can be a threat because of the amount of lead, chromium, cadmium, PCDD F and fecal streptococci that can be absorbed. (ii) Though concern about contamination through the food chain is weak when compost is used in agriculture, some authors anticipate accumulation of pollutants after several years of disposal, which might lead to future hazards. (iii) Exposure is also associated with atmospheric dispersion of compost organic dust that convey microorganisms and toxicants. Data on hazard posed by organic dust from municipal composts to the farmer or the private user is scarce. To date, microorganisms are only measured at composting plants, thus raising the issue of extrapolation to environmental situations. Lung damage and allergies may occur because of organic dust, Gram negative bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi. Further research is needed on the risk related to inhalation of chemical compounds.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter examines families of serine peptidases. Serine peptidases are found in viruses, bacteria, and eukaryotes. They include exopeptidases, endopeptidases, oligopeptidases, and omega peptidases. On the basis of three-dimensional structures, most of the serine peptidase families can be grouped together into about six clans that may have common ancestors. The structures are known for members of four of the clans, chymotrypsin, subtilisin, carboxypeptidase C, and Escherichia D-Ala-D-Ala peptidase A. The peptidases of chymotrypsin, subtilisin, and carboxypeptidase C clans have a common “catalytic triad” of three amino acids—namely, serine (nucleophile), aspartate (electrophile), and histidine (base). The geometric orientations of these are closely similar between families; however the protein folds are quite different. The arrangements of the catalytic residues in the linear sequences of members of the various families commonly reflect their relationships at the clan level. The members of the chymotrypsin family are almost entirely confined to animals. 10 families are included in chymotrypsin clan (SA), and all the active members of these families are endopeptidases. The order of catalytic residues in the polypeptide chain in clan SA is His/Asp/Ser.",1
"Multiple sclerosis is the principal demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Although the prevalence of the disease is moderately low, averaging about 40 cases per 100,000 people in high risk areas, it is a particularly devastating disease. It primarily affects young adults, is chronic, and has an unpredictable course. Most discouraging, the cause of the disease is not known and an effective treatment has not been identified. Recently, however, research has yielded some important findings concerning the etiology of MS. Much evidence now points to an immunological process as one of the major elements in the disease. It is also likely that an environmental influence, possibly an infectious process, may contribute to the disease. Finally, it is now certain that genetic makeup influences susceptibility to the disease. At present, the strongest evidence is for a polygenic effect, not the effect of a single gene or gene locus. This review will examine some of the possible immunologically mediated disease processes that could be involved in MS, especially those that could account for a role for infectious and genetic factors in the disease.",1
"Dose-response studies on subcutaneous cocaine were done to ascertain its effects in nucleus accumbens in dopaminergic and serotonergic neuronal circuitry in the behaving rat with in vivo voltammetry. Simultaneously, and at each dose of cocaine, unconditioned psychomotor stimulant behavior induced by cocaine was studied in terms of multiple concurrent measures of spontaneous behavior and by activity patterns of locomotion. Time course studies showed that the neurochemical effects of cocaine (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg SC) significantly (p<0.001) increased accumbens synaptic concentrations of dopamine (DA) and concurrently and significantly (p<0.0001) decreased accumbens synaptic concentrations of serotonin (5-HT) in a dose response manner. Simulataneous behavioral time course studies showed that cocaine (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg SC) significantly (p<0.0001) increased ambulations (locomotor activity), fine movements (stereotypic movements of sniffing and grooming) and rearing behavior, while significantly decreasing agoraphobic behavior, as measured by a statistically significant increase in central ambulations (p<0.0001). The high dose of cocaine (40 mg/kg SC) significantly increased fine movements over those produced by the lower doses of cocaine (p<0.0002). One import of the findings is that the DA and 5-HT biogenic amine response occurs in a behavioral paradigm of psychomotor stimulation, which is a known measure of reinforcement. Another is that the biogenic amines DA and 5-HT are affected by cocaine in this reinforcement paradigm with exactly opposite directionality. Finally, acute cocaine administration is shown to produce a dose response inhibition of agoraphobia (fear),w hich is highly correlated (ϱ=.983, p<0.01) with the opposing effects of cocaine on the accumbens biogenic amines, DA and 5-HT.",1
"The effect of cocaine (20 mg/kg SC) on presynaptic mechanisms of release for dopamine (DA) and for serotonin (5-HT) was studied in nucleus accumbens of unrestrained rats (Rattus norvegicus). The studies were done by assaying synaptic concentrations of DA and 5-HT in the presence of the neuronal impulse flow inhibitor, γ-butyrolactone (γ-BL). The results were compared with cocaine effects on accumbens DA and 5-HT in the freely moving rat, without γ-BL treatment. A neurochemical time course profile showed that the cocaine-induced increase in accumbens synaptic concentrations of DA was significantly blocked (p<0.0001) after DA impulse flow was significantly inhibited (p<0.0038) by γ-BL (35.8%). The neurochemical time course profile concurrently showed that the cocaine-induced decrease in accumbens synaptic concentrations of 5-HT was significantly blocked (p<0.0004) after impulse flow was significantly inhibited (p<0.025) by γ-BL (50.6%). The findings show that cocaine's effects on synaptic concentrations for DA and for HT in accumbens are dependent on neuronal impulse flow. The findings indicate that presynaptic releasing mechanisms, which may be different for DA vis-à-vis 5-HT, play a role in the mechanism of action of cocaine.",1
"The effect of subcutaneous (SC) cocaine (20 mg/kg) on synaptic concentrations of the biogenic amines, dopamine (DA), and serotonin (5-HT) in Ventral Tegmental Area, (VTA-[A10]) was studied in freely moving and behaving rats (rattus norvegicus) with in vivo voltammetry (in vivo electrochemistry). The actual detection of the biogenic amines was on-line and within a temporal resolution of seconds. Simultaneously, the psychostimulant behavior induced by cocaine was studied by infrared photocell beam detection. The results show that cocaine concurrently and significantly increased synaptic concentrations of DA (p < 0.0001) and 5-HT (p < 0.004) in VTA. Serotonin changes were accompanied by a notable oscillatory pattern. Importantly, DA and 5-HT changes in VTA were significantly and positively correlated (p < 0.01). Moreover, psychostimulant behaviors induced by cocaine were significantly increased over control values (p < 0.0001). Psychostimulant behaviors were significantly correlated with concurrently changing synaptic concentrations of DA (p < 0.01) and also with 5-HT to a lesser degree. Additionally, behavioral data indicate that cocaine may exhibit an anxiolytic effect during acute administration because agoraphobic behavior, as shown by increased central ambulatory behavior, was dramatically reduced by cocaine. Summarily, the present findings show that cocaine increased synaptic concentrations of DA in VTA, an action that is correlated with cocaine-induced psychostimulant behavior. The DA-ergic effect appears to be tonically maintained. Furthermore, new findings demonstrate a colocalized, cocaine induced 5-HT-ergic effect in VTA, which keeps pace with cocaine-induced alterations in DA-ergic neurotransmission. Thus, 5-HT may be a relay or a gating mechanism for a DA reward signalling pathway for cocaine.",1
"The effect of IV cocaine (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg) was studied on synaptic concentrations of dopamine (DA) and serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] in the mesoaccumbens nerve terminal, the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), in chloral hydrate-anesthetized, male Sprague-Dawley rats (Rattus norvegicus) with in vivo electrochemistry (voltammetry). In further in vivo voltammetric studies, the effects of SC cocaine on synaptic concentrations of DA and 5-HT were studied in the chloral hydrate-anesthetized paradigm in two neuroanatomic substrates, NAcc and mesoaccumbens somatodendrites, the ventral tegmental area (VTA-A10), in a dose-response fashion (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) in six separate studies. Moreover, in two additional in vivo voltammetric studies, again using the chloral hydrate-anesthetized paradigm, the impulse flow blocker, γ-butyrolactone (γ-BL) (750 mg/kg, IP), was studied alone and in combination with SC cocaine (20 mg/kg) to determine whether or not cocaine can act by presynaptic releasing mechanisms for DA and 5-HT. The results show that IV cocaine concurrently and significantly increased DA and 5-HT release in the NAcc (p < 0.001, p < 0.0005, respectively) at both doses tested. Moreover, IV cocaine effects on DA and 5-HT release were significantly and positively correlated (p < 0.01). On the other hand, SC cocaine concurrently and significantly decreased DA and 5-HT release in NAcc (p < 0.0001) and VTA (p < 0.0001) at each separate dose tested. SC cocaine effects on DA and 5-HT release were significantly and positively correlated across dose and neuroanatomic substrate (p < 0.01). Furthermore, the γ-BL studies indicate that cocaine's action includes a presynaptic release mechanism for the biogenic amines. Summarily, the data show that a consideration of the route of cocaine administration is crucial in determining the underlying neurochemical basis for cocaine.",1
"Cocaine (10 mg/kg), administered intraperitoneal (IP), was studied for its effects on dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) release in ventrolateral nucleus accumbens (vlNAcc) of conscious and behaving male, virus-free, Sprague-Dawley rats with in vivo electrochemistry (voltammetry). Miniature stearate probes detected DA and 5-HT release, on line and within a temporal resolution of seconds. Psychostimulant behaviors, in the form of four behavioral components (i.e., the classically DA-dependent behaviors of locomotor activity [ambulations], rearing, and stereotypy, and a 5-HT-ergic behavior, central ambulations) were studied concurrently with infrared photobeam detection. The results show that (IP) cocaine significantly increased vlNAcc DA release (p < 0.0001) and 5-HT release (p < 0.0012). Each of the four parameters of cocaine-induced psychostimulant behavior was concurrently and significantly increased as well (ambulations: p < 0.0001; rearing: p < 0.0008; stereotypy: p < 0.0004; central ambulations: p < 0.0082). Moreover, exactly coincident data points for DA and 5-HT release occurred 10 and 40 min after (IP) cocaine administration. Cocaine-induced DA and 5-HT release were highly and positively correlated during the first hour of study (p < 0.01). As expected, increased DA release in vlNAcc after cocaine administration was significantly and positively correlated with classically DA-dependent behaviors (first- and second-hour effects) (p < 0.01) and with the 5-HT-ergic behavior, central ambulations (p < 0.01). Also, cocaine-induced 5-HT release was significantly and positively correlated with 5-HT behavior (p < 0.01). However, not as expected, classically DA-dependent behaviors were more positively correlated with cocaine-induced 5-HT release in vlNAcc throughout the two-hour period of study. Thus, the present findings show that 5-HT is a comediator with DA in the cocaine response in vlNAcc. Importantly, 5-HT may signal the known DA response to cocaine.",1
"Ibogaine, a serotonergic (5-HTergic) indole alkaloid, was studied for cocaine modulatory effects on four parameters of behavior by computerized infrared photocell beam detection. The behavioral parameters were: a) locomotor activity (ambulations), b) rearing, c) stereotypy (fine movements, primarily grooming), and d) agoraphobia [(thigmotaxis) a natural tendency to avoid the center of the behavioral chamber]. With each behavioral data point, dopamine (DA) release, and serotonin (5-HT) release were detected within seconds in nucleus accumbens (NAcc) of the same behaving male Sprague-Dawley rats, using in vivo electrochemistry (voltammetry). Ibogaine was administered (40 mg/kg IP) for 4 consecutive days. Importantly, the DAergic and the 5-HTergic responses to (SC) cocaine and two behavioral responses, ambulations and central ambulations, were reduced in intensity due to extended time spent in the novel behavioral chamber (habituated). Rearing and fine movement patterns were not habituated. The results show that ibogaine downmodulated the (SC) cocaine-induced increase in NAcc DA release (p < 0.0001) and potentiated the (SC) cocaine-induced decrease in NAcc 5-HT release (p < 0.0001). Concurrently, ibogaine downmodulated cocaine-induced ambulation (p < 0.0001) and central ambulation behavior (p < 0.0001). On the other hand, the behavioral parameters that did not exhibit habituation, i.e., rearing behavior and fine movement behavior, were not downmodulated by ibogaine (p < 0.1558) (p < 0.3763), respectively. Furthermore, ibogaine itself did not significantly alter NAcc DA release over the 2-h period studied (p < 0.9113) although individual time points were significantly affected bidirectionally. Concurrently ibogaine significantly increased 5-HT release (p < 0.0155). Behaviorally, ibogaine appears to be a weak psychostimulant. The data show a critical modulatory role for 5-HT in ibogaine-cocaine interactions. Also elucidated as critical is the efficacy of ibogaine when the response to (SC) cocaine is decreased due to the habituation of the animals to their environment.",1
"A discussion of possible mechanisms for virus-induced wheezing in normal and asthmatic children is presented. Presently attractive theories for immune injury in viral bronchiolitis include those which depend on pathology induced by types 1, 3, and 4 of Gell and Coombs. The continuum of viral bronchiolitis with virus-induced wheezing in young children who are labeled “asthmatic” argues for some common mechanism of bronchiolar obstruction.",1
"One hundred and three patients (90 nonatopics and 13 atopics) with respiratory infections to various viral agents were studied retrospectively with respect to IgE immunoglobulin levels during acute (1 to 7 days) and convalescent (8 to 30 days) phases of infection. It was found that 59% of patients had a decrease of 20% or more in IgE level, 27% remained the same, and only 14% showed a rise of 20% or more from the acute to the convalescent phases of infection. IgE levels decreased up to 3 to 4 wk after symptoms and the degree of decrease was more apparent for the nonatopics who had higher IgE levels in their acute phase of infection. Less dramatic decrease in IgE was observed for the 13 atopics studied. The changes in IgE levels during the viral infectious period are discussed in terms of possible cellular mechanisms that may control IgE immunoglobulin.",1
"Children born into allergic families, with two allergic parents, are at high risk of developing allergy within the first 5 years of life. In order to observe possible external factors in the sensitization process, a prospective study of 13 such children was done, in which serial clinical and immunologic observations were made at 3- to 6-month intervals over a period of 1 to 4 yr. Eleven of these children are now clinically allergic; 5 have asthma. Immunologic evidence for allergic sensitization was observed in these 11 children by RAST, antigen-induced leukocyte histamine release, lymphoblastogenesis, and rise in serum IgE. Upper respiratory infections (URI) occurred in these 11 allergic children 1 to 2 months prior to the onset of allergic sensitization. In 10 of these 11 URI children, complement-fixing antibodies to viruses (parainfluenza, RSV, CMV) increased in the same blood samples in which immunologic allergic sensitization was first evidenced. This coincidence suggests that certain viruses may contribute to the allergic sensitization process.",1
"The mammary glands represent one part of the mucosal immune system, a definable, subunit of humoral and cellular immune functions in man that appears to have developed particular qualities well suited to guard our interface with the environment. As our understanding of secretory immunoglobulins and lymphocyte migration patterns continues to develop, the immunologic components found in breast milk appear increasingly likely to play a specific immunologic role in the protection of the nursing infant. The biologic basis for the observed protective effect of breast-feeding is reviewed with an emphasis on the mechanisms involved in the development and maintenance of mucosal immunity in general.",1
"Inflammatory processes of the upper airway may alter the responsiveness of the lower airway. For example, bronchial hyperresponsiveness may be seen in patients with allergic rhinitis. This could represent coexistent but unrecognized asthma, but also suggests that IgE-dependent inflammation may occur in the lower airway that can increase bronchial hyperresponsiveness without at the same time precipitating obvious obstruction. Clearly, allergic rhinitis is a risk factor for asthma. A second example of the interaction of upper airway inflammation and bronchial hyperreactivity are reports that viral upper respiratory tract infections may cause otherwise healthy persons to respond abnormally to inhaled histamine or irritants for several months after the infections. These same viruses usually precipitate attacks in patients with asthma, who already have hyperresponsive airways. Both of these examples suggest that inflammatory processes occurring totally or primarily in the upper airway may participate in the pathogenesis of lower respiratory tract hyperresponsiveness and asthma.",1
"We have demonstrated that human peripheral blood basophils released histamine on direct incubation with paramyxoviruses in vitro. Most histamine release occurred during the first 15 to 30 minutes after challenge, depending on the dose of virus used; release initiated by virus was complete by 1 hour. At a virus/cell ratio of 1:1, Sendai virus caused 41 ± 9% histamine release, whereas parainfluenza type 3 (PI-3) virus caused 25 ± 5% release and respiratory syncytial (RS) virus caused 19 ± 5% release. Sendai, but not PI-3 or RS, also caused a decrease in cell number and release of lactic dehydrogenase; however, this apparent cell lysis did not account for all the histamine released. Incubation of cells with virus desensitized them to subsequent triggering by viruses but did not affect response of cells to other stimuli. Histamine release was dependent on the virus/cell ratio, temperature, and metabolic energy, but it was not strictly dependent on the presence of calcium in the extracellular medium. Histamine release was not affected by preincubation of cells with colchicine, suggesting that microtubules were not involved in the release process. Basophils desensitized by anti-IgE in the absence of calcium or treated with lactic acid to dissociate IgE molecules from membrane receptors released amounts of histamine similar to that of control basophils; thus, release was not initiated through Fcϵ receptors. It was found, however, that histamine release by these viruses was greatly reduced when concanavalin A was used for desensitization. These data demonstrate that the respiratory viruses studied can cause direct nonimmunologic release of histamine from human basophils. Our findings provide evidence for another mechanism by which respiratory viruses can initiate inflammation.",1
"To determine if individuals with allergic rhinitis are hyperresponsive to upper respiratory tract viral infections, 20 allergic and 18 nonallergic, susceptible, adult volunteers were challenged and infected with rhinovirus type 39 before the pollen seasons. Before challenge and on each of 6 days of cloister, all volunteers were interviewed for symptoms and completed a test battery consisting of evaluations of secretion production by weighed tissues, nasal patency by active posterior rhinomanometry, nasal clearance by the dyed saccharin technique, pulmonary function by spirometry, eustachian tube function by sonotubometry, and middle ear status by tympanometry. The symptomatology and pathophysiology resulting from the rhinovirus infection were consistent with those reported in previous studies with this challenge system. Between-group comparisons revealed no differences in symptom presentation, nasal secretion production, or overall pathophysiologic response. However, for decreased mucociliary clearance rate, increased nasal congestion, eustachian tube dysfunction, and symptoms of sneezing, the allergic group demonstrated an earlier onset compared with that of the nonallergic group. The biologic significance of the differences in onset of dysfunction is tempered by the observation that the temporal pattern of responses in the allergic group was similar with that of nonallergic subjects in previous studies. The results of the present study do not support the hypothesis of a physiologic hyperresponsiveness to rhinovirus type 39 infection in allergic subjects during nonallergy seasons.",1
"Two virus-like particles have been found to be associated with acute viral gastroenteritis. One, a 270-nm parvovirus-like particle (the Norwalk agent), was visualized and recognized by immune electron microscopy in an infectious stool filtrate derived from a community outbreak of nonbacterial gastroenteritis. It appears to be one of the etiologic agents of a usually self-limited form of gastroenteritis which commonly occurs in community outbreaks. The other, a 70-nm reovirus-like particle, has been observed by electron microscopy in specimens from infants and children with severe diarrhea in many parts of the world. The reovirus-like particle may emerge as a major etiologic agent of diarrhea of infants and young children.",1
"Infection of mice with the neurotropic JHM strain of murine hepatitis virus causes demyelinating lesions resulting from an infection of the oligodendroglia. This was most evident in mice inoculated intraperitoneally with JHM. Such CNS lesions were not observed in mice inoculated intraperitoneally with the MHV3 strain. An in vitro system is described in which the rat glial RN2 cell line functions as a discriminating host for the JHM virus. Shortly after inoculation, this virus establishes a persistent infection in which there is a cyclical rise and fall in titer with an accompanying cytopathology. Furthermore, this host cell confers a thermal lability which the virus does not demonstrate in the fully permissive host cell, L-2. By comparison, infection of RN2 cells with the prototype MHV3 is aborted immediately. In the persistent infection of RN2 cells with measles virus, Hallé strain, the cell again confers a temperature sensitivity which the virus does not possess when replicating in Vero cells. This appears to be the first instance in which a cloned cell line of glial origin determines the outcome of the infectious process, discriminating in favor of a neurotropic variant which possesses a tropism for the glia in vivo. Systems such as the one described here may now offer a specific screening procedure for selecting, identifying and characterizing the nature of neurotropic viruses.",1
"The aphthovirus genome consists of a single molecule of single-stranded RNA that encodes all the virus-induced proteins. We isolated recombinant aphthoviruses from cells simultaneously infected with temperature-sensitive mutants of two different subtype strains. Analysis of the proteins induced by 16 independently generated recombinants revealed two types of protein pattern, which were consistent with single genetic crossovers on the 5′ side and 3′ side, respectively, of the central P34-coding region. Recombinants invariably inherited all four coat proteins from the same parent, and novel recombinant proteins were not observed. RNAase T1 fingerprints of virus RNA, prepared from representatives of each recombinant type, confirmed the approximate crossover sites that had been deduced from the inheritance of proteins. These fingerprints provide molecular evidence of recombination at the level of RNA and demonstrate the potential of RNA recombination for producing genetic diversity among picornaviruses.",1
"The O-linked oligosaccharides on mature forms of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) glycoproteins were characterized, and were found to account largely for the lower electrophoretic mobilities of these forms relative to the mobilities of immature forms. Other posttranslational modifications of HSV1 glycoproteins (designated gB, gC, gD and gE) were related temporally to the discrete shifts in electrophoretic mobilities that signal acquisition of the O-linked oligosaccharides. Fatty acid acylation (principally of gE) could be detected just prior to the shifts, whereas conversion of high-mannosetype N-linked oligosaccharides to the complex type occurred coincident with the shifts. The addition of O-linked oligosaccharides did not occur in cells treated with the ionophore monensin or in a ricinresistant cell line defective in the processing of N-linked oligosaccharides. We conclude that extension of O-linked oligosaccharide chains on HSV1 glycoproteins, and probably also attachment of the first O-linked sugars, occurs as a late posttranslational modification in the Golgi apparatus.",1
"Messenger RNA was prepared from a hybridoma cell line secreting a monoclonal antibody (53FC3) directed against a luminal epitope of a Golgi membrane protein (Mr = 135 kd) found in rodent cells. When this mRNA was microinjected into the cytoplasm of BHK cells, mouse IgG was seen to accumulate in the Golgi complex after 5–6 hr of incubation. No accumulation was seen in 3T3 cells which lack the epitope recognized by 53FC3. When microinjected BHK cells were infected with vesicular stomatitis virus, surface expression of the viral G protein was considerably reduced when compared with neighboring noninjected cells.",1
"The 35 nucleotide spliced leader (SL) sequence is found on the 5′ end of numerous trypanosome mRNAs, yet the tandemly organized reiteration units encoding this leader are not detectably linked to any of these structural genes. Here we report the presence of a class of discrete small SL RNA molecules that are derived from the genomic SL reiteration units of Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Leptomonas collosoma. These small SL RNAs are 135, 105, and 95 nucleotides, respectively, and contain a 5′-terminal SL or SL-like sequence. S1 nuclease analyses demonstrate that these small SL RNAs are transcribed from continuous sequence within the respective SL reiteration units. With the exception of the SL sequence and a concensus donor splice site immediately following it, these small RNAs are not well conserved. We suggest that the small SL RNAs may function as a donor of the SL sequence in an intermolecular process that places the SL at the 5′ terminus of many trypanosomatid mRNAs.",1
"A 5′-terminal leader sequence of 35 nucleotides was found to be present on multiple trypanosome RNAs. Based on its representation in cDNA libraries, we estimate that many, if not all, trypanosome mRNAs contain this leader. This same leader was originally identified on mRNAs encoding the molecules responsible for antigenic variation, variant surface glycoproteins. Studies of selected cDNAs containing this leader sequence revealed that leader-containing transcripts can be stage-specific, stage-regulated, or constitutive. They can be abundant or rare, and transcribed from single or multigene families. No linkage between the genomic leader sequences and the structural gene exons was observed. Possible mechanisms by which the leader sequences are added to trypanosome mRNAs are discussed.",1
"Previously, we reported that ZP3, one of three different glycoproteins present in the mouse egg's zona pellucida, serves as a sperm receptor. Furthermore, small glycopeptides derived from egg ZP3 retain full sperm receptor activity, suggesting a role for carbohydrate, rather than polypeptide chain in receptor function. Here, we report that removal of O-linked oligosaccharides from ZP3 destroys its sperm receptor activity, whereas removal of O-linked oligosaccharides has no effect. A specific size class of O-linked oligosaccharides, recovered following mild alkaline hydrolysis and reduction of ZP3, is shown to possess sperm receptor activity and to bind to sperm. The results presented strongly suggest that mouse sperm bind to eggs via O-linked oligosaccharides present on ZP3.",1
"Using ts045, a temperature sensitive strain of Vesicular stomatitis virus, we show that oligomerization of G protein is a prerequisite for its transport from RER to the Golgi apparatus and for its subsequent maturation. While wild-type G forms an oligomer in the RER, ts045 G synthesized at the nonpermissive temperature does not. When the permissive temperature is reinstated, ts045 G forms an oligomer and moves to the Golgi. The state of oligomerization was determined by chemical cross-linking and by the ability of a microinjected monoclonal antibody specific for the carboxy-terminal five amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail of G to cause patching of G in intracellular membranes. We conclude that formation of an oligomer of G protein, probably a trimer, is necessary for G protein maturation.",1
"We have investigated RNA recombination among poliovirus genomes by analyzing both intratypic and intertypic recombinant crosses involving the same defined genetic markers. Sequence analysis of the recombinant junctions of 13 nonsibling intertypic recombinants showed that intertypic RNA recombination is not site-specific, nor does it require extensive homology between the recombining parents at the crossover site. To discriminate between breaking-rejoining and copy choice mechanisms of RNA recombination, we have inhibited the replication of the recombining parents independently and found opposite effects on the frequency of genetic recombination in intratypic crosses. The results strongly support a copy choice mechanism for RNA recombination, in which the viral RNA polymerase switches templates during negative strand synthesis.",1
"The 5′ ends of trypanosome mRNAs consist of an identical sequence of 35 nucleotides. This “mini-exon” sequence is derived from the 5′ end of a 137 nucleotide RNA (medRNA). The remainder of each mRNA is derived from a protein-coding exon that is not linked to the mini-exon. We propose that medRNA is spliced in trans to de-novo-initiated transcripts of protein-coding genes. This trans splicing model predicts that the downstream portion of medRNA will be part of a branched structure and then be released as a free product (minRNA). We demonstrate that significant levels of minRNA exist in trypanosome RNA. Furthermore, minRNA can be released from high molecular weight RNA by a HeLa cell S100 “debranching” extract. We conclude that trnas splicing is the physiological process by which mature mRNA molecules are synthesized in trypanosomes.",1
"The human invariant chain (Iγ) of class II histocompatibility antigens spans the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum once. It exposes a small amino-terminal domain on the cytoplasmic side and a carboxyterminal, glycosylated domain on the exoplasmic side of the membrane. When the exoplasmic domain of Iγ is replaced by the cytoplasmic protein chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), CAT becomes the exoplasmic, glycosylated domain of the resulting membrane protein IγCAT∗. Deletion of the hydrophilic cytoplasmic domain from IγCAT gives rise to a secreted protein from which an amino-terminal segment is cleaved, most likely by signal peptidase. We conclude that the membrane-spanning region of Iγ contains a signal sequence in its amino-terminal half and that hydrophilic residues at the amino-terminal end of a signal sequence can determine cleavage by signal peptidase.",1
"We describe the unusual structure of a vaccinia virus late mRNA. In these molecules, the protein-coding sequences of a major late structural polypeptide are preceded by long leader RNAs, which in some cases are thousands of nucleotides long. These sequences map to different regions of the viral genome and in one instance are separated from the late gene by more than 100 kb of DNA. Moreover, the leader sequences map either upstream or downstream of the late gene, are transcribed from either DNA strand, and are fused to the late gene coding sequence via a poly(A) stretch. This demonstrates that vaccinia virus produces late mRNAs by tagging the protein-coding sequences onto the 3′ end of other RNAs.",1
"We have demonstrated by primer elongation and cap analysis that mature vaccinia virus late transcripts are discontinuously synthesized. We have shown that RNA transcripts from a translocated 11K and from the authentic 11K and 4b late promoters are extended by approximately 35 nucleotides beyond the “start site” determined by S1 mapping using vaccinia genomic DNA as a probe. Sequencing of the RNA and of the first strand cDNA reveal that a homopolymeric poly(A) sequence is linked to the 5′ terminus of the RNA transcripts. S1 mapping of RNA transcripts with a DNA probe containing an A-stretch, replacing promoter sequences upstream of position −1, confirms the existence of a poly(A) leader of approximately 35 A-residues.",1
"The E19 protein of adenoviruses is a transmembrane protein that abrogates the intracellular transport of class I antigens by forming complexes with them in the ER. We show here that the E19 protein is retained in the ER even in the absence of class I antigens. To define the region conferring residency in the ER, we examined two mutant forms of the viral protein. A 5 amino acid extension of the 15-membered cytoplasmic tail of the protein reduces its interaction with class I antigens but does not change its intracellular distribution. Shortening the tail to 7 amino acids also diminishes the affinity for class I antigens; however, this mutant E19 protein becomes transported to the cell surface. Thus, we concluded that a small stretch of amino acids exposed on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane is responsible for the retention of the E19 protein in the ER.",1
"While determining the 5′ ends of C. elegans actin mRNAs, we have discovered a 22 nucleotide spliced leader sequence. The leader sequence is found on mRNA from three of the four nematode actin genes. The leader also appears to be present on some, but not all, nonactin mRNAs. The actin mRNA leader sequence is identical to the first 22 nucleotides of a novel 100 nucleotide RNA transcribed adjacent, and in the opposite orientation, to the 5S ribosomal gene. The evidence suggests that the actin mRNA leader sequence is acquired from this novel nucleotide transcript by an intermolecular trans-splicing mechanism.",1
"The gag-pol protein of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), the precursor to the enzymes responsible for reverse transcription and integration, is expressed from two genes that lie in different translational reading frames by ribosomal frameshifting. Here, we localize the site of frameshifting and show that the frameshifting reaction is mediated by slippage of two adjacent tRNAs by a single nucleotide in the 5′ direction. The gag terminator, which immediately follows the frameshift site, is not required for frameshifting. Other suspected retroviral frameshift sites mediate frameshifting when placed at the end of RSV gag. Mutations in RSV pol also affect synthesis of the gag-pol protein in vitro. The effects of these mutations best correlate with the potential to form an RNA stem-loop structure adjacent to the frameshift site. A short sequence of RSV RNA, 147 nucleotides in length, containing the frameshift site and stem-loop structure, is sufficient to direct frameshifting in a novel genetic context.",1
"We assessed the alterations of viral gene expression occurring during persistent infections by cloning full-length transcripts of measles virus (MV) genes from brain autopsies of two subacute sclerosing panencephalitis patients and one measles inclusion body encephalitis (MIBE) patient. The suquence of these MV genes revealed that, most likely, almost 2% of the nucleotides were mutated during persistence, and 35% of these differences resulted in amino acid changes. One of these nucleotide substitutions and one deletion resulted in alteration of the reading frames of two fusion genes, as confirmed by in vitro translation of synthetic mRNAs. One cluster of mutations was exceptional; in the matrix gene of the MIBE case, 50% of the U residues were changed to C, which might result from a highly biased copying event exclusively affecting this gene. We propose that the cluster of mutations in the MIBE case, and other combinations of mutations in other cases, favored propagation of MV infections in brain cells by conferring a selective advantage to the mutated genomes.",1
"We have isolated large amounts of E. coli outer-membrane protein A precursor (proOmpA). Purified proOmpA is active in membrane assembly, and this assembly is saturable with respect to the precursor protein. A proOmpA-Sepharose matrix allows affinity isolation of trigger factor, a soluble, 63,000 dalton monomeric protein that stabilizes proOmpA in assembly competent form. Comparison of trigger factor's amino-terminal sequence with those in a computer data bank and with those encoded by sec genes, as well as groEL and heat shock gene dnaK, suggests that trigger factor is encoded by a previously undescribed gene. Trigger factor and proOmpA form a 1:1 complex that can be isolated by gel filtration. Purified canine signal recognition particle (SRP) can also stabilize proOmpA for membrane insertion. This post-ribosomal activity of SRP suggests a unifying theme in protein translocation mechanisms.",1
"We have produced transgenic mouse strains harboring class II major histocompatibility complex or interferon-gamma genes linked to the human insulin promoter. These experiments were designed to investigate the consequences of the expression of immunological effector molecules by nonimmunological cells. In both of these studies we observed the disappearance from the pancreas of the insulin-producing β cells coinciding with the development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Transgenic mice expressing both chains of the I-A gene showed progressive atrophy of the islets of Langerhans, whereas mice expressing interferon-gamma suffered an inflammatory destruction of the islets.",1
"The genomic RNA of the coronavirus IBV contains an efficient ribosomal frameshifting signal at the junction of two overlapping open reading frames. We have defined by deletion analysis an 86 nucleotide sequence encompassing the overlap region which is sufficient to allow frameshifting in a heterologous context. The upstream boundary of the signal consists of the sequence UUUAAAC, which is the likely site of ribosomal slippage. We show by creation of complementary nucleotide changes that the RNA downstream of this “slippery” sequence folds into a tertiary structure termed a pseudoknot, the formation of which is essential for efficient frameshifting.",1
"The leukocyte-common antigen (L-CA) is a family of large molecular weight glycoproteins uniquely expressed on the surface of all nucleated cells of hematopoletic origin. The glycoprotein consists of a heavily glycosylated exterior domain, a single membrane spanning region, and a large cytoplasmic domain that contains tyrosine phosphatase activity. To investigate the function of this family, we generated T cell clones that lacked L-CA (L-CA−). The expression of the αβ T cell receptor, CD3, CD4, IL-2 receptor (p55), LFA-1, Thy-1, and Pgp-1 (CD44) was normal. The L-CA− T cell clones failed to proliferate in response to antigen or cross-linked CD3; however, they could still proliferate in response to IL-2. An L-CA+ revertant was obtained and the ability to proliferate in response to antigen and cross-linked CD3 was restored. These data indicate that L-CA is required for T cells to enter into cell cycle in response to antigen.",1
"To elucidate the mechanism of secretory granule formation, we here identify the first intermediate in this process, the immature secretory granule, in the neuroendocrine cell line PC12 and demonstrate the packaging of a regulated secretory protein, secretogranin II, to immature secretory granules in a cell-free system. The formation of immature secretory granules was as fast ( t 1 2 ≈ 5 min ) as that of constitutive secretory vesicles identified by the presence of a rapidly secreted heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Using the cell-free system, the formation of post-Golgi secretory vesicles was found to be dependent upon ATP. Two distinct populations of vesicles were formed: immature secretory granules containing secretogranin II and constitutive secretory vesicles containing the heparan sulfate proteoglycan. These results show that in a cell-free system, a constitutive and a regulated secretory protein are sorted upon exit from the trans-Golgi network.",1
"Bacteriophage T4 DNA topoisomerase gene 60 contains a 50 nucleotide untranslated region within the coding sequence of its mRNA. Translational bypass of this sequence by elongating ribosomes has been postulated for the mode of synthesis of an 18 kd polypeptide specified by the split coding segments. Ribosome bypass of the untranslated region also occurs when a segment of gene 60 is fused to lacZ and expressed in E. coli. The efficiency of bypass in these gene 60-lacZ fusions approaches 100%. Here, mutations that delete, insert, or substitute nucleotides from gene 60-lacZ fusions are examined. Essential features necessary for high level gap bypass emerging from this analysis are a cis-acting nascent peptide sequence, a short duplication bordering the gap, and a stop codon contained in a stem-loop structure at the 5′ junction of the gap.",1
"Ribosomal frameshifting regulates expression of the TYB gene of yeast Ty retrotransposons. We previously demonstrated that a 14 nucleotide sequence conserved between two families of Ty elements was necessary and sufficient to support ribosomal frameshifting. This work demonstrates that only 7 of these 14 nucleotides are needed for normal levels of frameshifting. Any change to the sequence CUU-AGG-C drastically reduces frameshifting; this suggests that two specific tRNAs, tRNALeu UAG and tRNAArg CCU, are involved in the event. Our tRNA overproduction data suggest that a leucyl-tRNA, probably tRNALeu UAG, an unusual leucine isoacceptor that recognizes all six leucine codons, slips from CUU-Leu onto UUA-Leu (in the +1 reading frame) during a translational pause at the AGG-Arg codon induced by the low availability of tRNAArg CCU, encoded by a single-copy essential gene. Frameshifting is also directional and reading frame specific. Interestingly, frameshifting is inhibited when the “slip” CUU codon is located three codons downstream, but not four or more codons downstream, of the translational initiation codon.",1
"Brefeldin A (BFA) is a unique drug affecting the molecular mechanisms that regulate membrane traffic and organelle structure. BFA's ability to alter retrograde traffic from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) led us to ask whether the ERD-2 retrieval receptor, proposed to return escaped ER resident proteins from the Golgi, might either interfere with or mimic the effects of the drug. When either human ERD-2 or a novel human homolog (referred to as ELP-1) is overexpressed in a variety of cell types, the effects are phenotypically indistinguishable from the addition of BFA. These include the redistribution of the Golgi coat protein, β-COP, to the cytosol, the loss of the Golgi apparatus as a distinct organelle, the mixing of this organelle with the ER, the addition of complex oligosaccharides to resident ER glycoproteins, and the block of anterograde traffic. Thus, these receptors may provide signals that regulate retrograde traffic between the Golgi and the ER.",1
"We have designed and utilized two in vivo assays of kinetochore integrity in S. cerevisiae. One assay detects relaxation of a transcription block formed at centromeres; the other detects an increase in the mitotic stability of a dicentric test chromosome. ctf13-30 and ctf14-42 were identified as putative kinetochore mutants by both assays. CTF14 is identical to NDC10 CBF2 , a recently identified essential gene that encodes a 110 kd kinetochore component. CTF13 is an essential gene that encodes a predicted 478 amino acid protein with no homology to known proteins. ctf13 mutants missegregate chromosomes at permissive temperature and transiently arrest at nonpermissive temperature as large-budded cells with a G2 DNA content and a short spindle. Antibodies recognizing epitope-tagged CTF13 protein decrease the electrophoretic mobility of a CEN DNA-protein complex formed in vitro. Together, the genetic and biochemical data indicate that CTF13 is an essential kinetochore protein.",1
"Three-dimensional structures of a native simian and reassortant rotavirus have been determined by electron cryomicroscopy and computer image processing. The structural features of the native virus confirm that the hemagglutinin spike is a dimer of VP4, substantiated by in vivo radiolabeling studies. Exchange of native VP4 with a bovine strain equivalent results in a poorly infectious reassortant. No VP4 spikes are detected in the three-dimensional reconstruction of the reassortant. The difference map between the two structures reveals a novel large globular domain of VP4 buried within the virion that interacts extensively with the intermediate shell protein, VP6. Our results suggest that assembly of VP4 precedes that of VP7, the major outer shell protein, and that VP4 may play an important role in the receptor recognition and budding process through the rough endoplasmic reticulum during virus maturation.",1
"Structural similarity between viral T cell epitopes and self-peptides could lead to the induction of an autoaggressive T cell response. Based on the structural requirements for both MHC class 11 binding and TCR recognition of an immunodominant myelin basic protein (MBP) peptide, criteria for a data base search were developed in which the degeneracy of amino acid side chains required for MHC class 11 binding and the conservation of those required for T cell activation were considered. A panel of 129 peptides that matched the molecular mimicry motif was tested on seven MBP-specific T cell clones from multiple sclerosis patients. Seven viral and one bacterial peptide efficiently activated three of these clones. Only one peptide could have been identified as a molecular mimic by sequence alignment. The observation that a single T cell receptor can recognize quite distinct but structurally related peptides from multiple pathogens has important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of autoimmunity.",1
"Rat antizyme gene expression requires programmed, ribosomal frameshifting. A novel autoregulatory mechanism enables modulation of frameshifting according to the cellular concentration of polyamines. Antizyme binds to, and destabilizes, ornithine decarboxylase, a key enzyme in polyamine synthesis. Rapid degradation ensues, thus completing a regulatory circuit. In vitro experiments with a fusion construct using reticulocyte lysates demonstrate polyamine-dependent expression with a frameshift efficiency of 19% at the optimal concentration of spermidine. The frameshift is +1 and occurs at the codon just preceding the terminator of the initiating frame. Both the termination codon of the initiating frame and a pseudoknot downstream in the mRNA have a stimulatory effect. The shift site sequence, UCC-UGA-U, is not similar to other known frameshift sites. The mechanism does not seem to involve re-pairing of peptidyl-tRNA in the new frame but rather reading or occlusion of a fourth base.",1
"Sera from 486 bovine fetuses, approximately 60 to 270 days of gestation, were collected at slaughter and tested for the presence of immunoglobulins (Ig). One hundred ten (27%) of the sera were positive for IgG and/or IgM. The earliest age at which fetuses tested positive for IgM and IgG was estimated to be 100 and 120 days, respectively. Ig concentration increased with increased age of the fetus. Sera that were positive for Ig were tested for the presence of specific antibodies to five different infectious agents. Bovine parvovirus antibodies were found in 99 of 110 sera (90%) by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. However, only 35 (31.8%) of these sera were positive by serum neutralization (SN) test. Antibodies to parainfluenza-3 virus were detected in 30 sera (27%) by HI test and in 20 sera (18%) by SN test. Five (4%) sera contained SN antibodies to bovine viral diarrhea virus. Only one (0.9%) serum sample contained SN antibodies to infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus. None of the sera had antibodies against five Leptospira spp. Results of this study suggest that bovine parvovirus may be a potential cause of reproductive problems in cattle.",1
"The transportation of embryos obtained from animal models, endangered species and nondomestic farmed animals (e.g., deer) can reduce/eliminate the need for shipping postnatal animals and thus has gained the interest of the biomedical and conservation fields. Efficient movement of germ plasm worldwide requires established cryobanks. Embryo cryopreservation has become a routinely successful technology for many species and efforts to develop usable cryobanks for many target species are ongoing. Recommended regulations for the movement of embryos from nontraditional (i.e. other than domestic livestock) species are nonexistent. Efforts are underway to establish domestic and international handling guidelines and to recommend suitable quarantine conditions to facilitate embryo importation. Further basic research on specific zona pellucida-pathogen interactions is encouraged to support embryo movement efforts.",1
"The dominant reason for exposing humans to the risks of space flight is their ability to perform complex tasks and make complex decisions. To fulfill such a role, crews must be shielded against even incipient degradation of performance capacity. The space environment contains potential hazardsranging from microgravity to infectious microorganisms to chemical toxicants. An extensive literature indicates that incipient disruptions of function may occur at low levels of exposure to toxic agents and degrade performance. Such questions need to be pursued before irreversible decisions are made about space vehicle design.",1
"Viral infection has often been suggested as a possible cause of Sjögren's syndrome or chronic lymphocytic sialadenitis, and Epstein-Barr virus has been found in the salivary glands of patients with this condition. After we had noted Sjögren's syndrome in several patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), a virus also excreted in saliva, we set up a prospective study to investigate the association of chronic lymphocytic sialadenitis, with or without symptoms, to chronic HCV liver disease. The histological appearances of labial salivary glands in patients with proven HCV hepatitis or cirrhosis were compared with those in dead controls. Histological changes characteristic of Sjögren's syndrome were significantly more common in HCV-infected patients (16 of 28, 57%) compared with controls (1 of 20, 5%). Focal lymphocytic sialadenitis characteristic of Sjögren's syndrome (though only 10 patients had xerostomia and none complained of xerophthalmia) appears to be common in patients with chronic HCV liver disease; if this association is confirmed, identification of the underlying mechanism may improve our understanding of both disorders.",1
"High concentrations of calcitonin-like immunoreactivity have been found in the blood of patients with various extrathyroid diseases. By means of a monoclonal immunoradiometric assay for calcitonin precursors, we have measured serum concentrations of procalcitonin in patients with various bacterial and viral infections. 79 children (newborn to age 12 years) in hospital with suspected infections were investigated prospectively. 19 patients with severe bacterial infections had very high serum concentrations of procalcitonin at diagnosis (range 6-53 ng/mL) in comparison with 21 children found to have no signs of infection (baseline concentrations <0·1 ng/mL). Serum procalcitonin values decreased rapidly during antibiotic therapy. 11 patients with peripheral bacterial colonisation or local infections without invasive sepsis and 18 (86%) of 21 patients with viral infections had concentrations within or slightly above the normal range (0·1-1·5 ng/mL). Among 9 severely burned patients studied in an intensive care unit, the post-traumatic course of procalcitonin concentrations (range 0·1-120 ng/mL) was closely related to infectious complications and acute septic episodes. Concentrations of mature calcitonin were normal in all subjects, whatever procalcitonin concentrations were found. Concentrations of a substance immunologically identical to procalcitonin are raised during septic conditions. Serum concentrations seem to be correlated with the severity of microbial invasion.",1
"A method was developed for quantitative measurement of ACTH1–39, produced by human lymphocytes. It was shown that pH adjustment to 2 was essential for processing of the precursor molecule proopiomelanocortin (POMC). Linearity between time of incubation and ACTH production was shown. The existence of specific endopeptidases in lymphocytes for processing of the POMC molecule remains doubtful.",1
"This article reviews the historical development of thalidomide as an immunosuppressive agent and the current state of knowledge of thalidomide as an anti-graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) agent. The evidence suggests that metabolites of thalidomide act at an early stage in the antigen recognition-activation pathway of graft T lymphocytes and down regulate normal lymphocyte responses. This effect seems to have beneficial effects in both acute and chronic GVHD, but the optimal mode of use in the clinical setting remains to be determined.",1
"Feline Infectious Peritonitis (F.I.P.) was diagnosed in the kittens of two successive litters born to a female presumed also infected. At the same time, the two fathers and the other subjects of the cattery remained asymptomatic of F.I.P. The clinical observations, supported by electrophoretic data, suggest the possibility of a direct transmission of the disease by the mother to her offspring, either by the transplacentary pathway (epigenetic transmission) or via the milk.",1
"The extensive use of negative staining techniques and electron microscopy in diagnostic centers has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of reported viral enteric infections in man and animals in the last 10 yr. Enteric infection due to adenoviruses, astroviruses, coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses, parvoviruses, picornaviruses (caliciviruses), rotaviruses as well as some unidentified viral particles are described. The brief literature review on each of these virus families is supplemented with clinical cases submitted to the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory. Comparative aspects of viral infections between different animal species as well as man are discussed wherever possible.",1
"Laboratory tests currently used or easily applicable in veterinary clinical immunology were reviewed in the following three categories: (1) tests detecting disorders in humoral immune response: serum protein screening tests, gammaglobulin estimation and complement testing: (2) tests detecting disorders in cellular immune response: phagocyte function tests and lymphocyte function tests; (3) tests detecting autoimmune disorders: detection of antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, autoimmune hemolytic diseases, and autoimmune organ and tissue disorders. The principles of the tests and the interpretations of the results are presented with the appropriate references.",1
"Non-immune kittens passively immunized with feline serum containing high-titered antibodies reactive with feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) developed a more rapid disease after FIPV challenge than did kittens pretreated with FIPV antibody-negative serum. Antibody-sensitized, FIPV challenged—kittens developed earlier clinical signs (including pyrexia, icterus, and thrombocytopenia) and died more rapidly than did non-sensitized, FIPV-challenged kittens. Mean survival time in sensitized kittens was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced compared to non-sensitized kittens (mean ± SEM, 10.0 ± 0.6 days vs. 28.8 ± 8.3 days, respectively). Lesions induced included fibrinous peritonitis, disseminated pyogranulomatous inflammation and necrotizing phlebitis and periphlebitis. FIPV antigen, immunoglobulin G, complement (C3) and fibrinogen were demonstrated in lesions by immunofluorescence microscopy. The pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) in persons bears striking resemblance to that of FIP in experimental kittens. In both FIP and DHF, non-neutralizing antibody may promote acute disease by enhancement of virus infection in mononuclear phagocytes or by formation of immune complexes, activation of complement and secondary vascular disturbances.",1
"A brief presentation is given of the enteric viral infections of young animals. The general characteristics of rotaviruses, coronaviruses and parvoviruses are reported, and the different aspects of the diseases associated with these viruses are discussed. Certain suggestions are made regarding the prevention of these diseases.",1
"Résumé Les auteurs ont observé que les anticorps SN (neutralisants), IFI (Immunofluorescence indirecte) et ID (Immunodiffusion) anti-Rota sont excrétés à un haut niveau dans le lait après vaccination des vaches à l'aide d'un vaccin Rota adjuvé, administré 3 semaines avant la mise-bas avec un rappel au moment du part. L'excrétion se maintient pendant au moins trois mois à un niveau se situant entre 10 et 50% du taux colostral. Ce travail confirme également la stimulation aspécifique de l'excretion d'anticorps anti-Rotavirus dans le lait par l'inoculation de la seule fraction adjuvante du vaccin. Cette excrétion est cependant moindre que celle induite par la vaccination à l'aide d'un vaccin anti-Rotavirus. The authors describe the evolution of the secretion of anti-Rotavirus antibodies vaccine given three weeks before and repeated at the moment of parturition. Rota virus antibodies were detected at a high level during the three months test period with the Indirect Immunofluorescence Test, the seroneutralisation test and the immunofluorescence test. The four untreated animals excreted only rota-antibodies till day 6 post partum. Seroneutralising antibodies were detected in the milk of the vaccinated animals at a level of 10–50% of the colostral level till day 90. The aspecific stimulation of the excretion of anti-Rotavirus antibodies in the milk after inoculation of the only adjuvant fraction of the vaccine is confirmed. The excretion level, however, was significantly lower than after Rotavirus vaccination.",1
"A group of SPF cats were moderately susceptible to the causal organism of contagious equine metritis (CEM) following intra-uterine or intrapreputial challenge with an Irish streptomycin resistant strain isolated from a clinically infected mare. Subclinical infections were established in only 50% of the cats, none of which became long-term carriers of the organism. Cytological examination of vaginal smears was of no diagnostic value in confirming infection in inapparently infected cats. Bacteriological responses after primary or secondary challenge with the CEM organism were essentially similar, with one exception, a female cat in which there was possible evidence of local immunity persisting after the primary infection. Efforts to reactivate shedding subsequent to the immediate post-challenge period were unsuccessful. Throughout the experimental period, the cats remained sero-negative to the complement-fixation test, and they failed to develop any significant increase in the levels of antibody activity as measured by the kinetics-based ELISA or KELA system. On day 89 after primary challenge, the cats were euthanized and various sites in the genitourinary tract and the internal iliac lymphatic glands subjected to bacteriological and pathological examination for evidence of CEM infection with negative results. The findings of this study, although establishing the transmissibility of the CEM organism for the cat, demonstrate the limited value of this species as an experimental model system for the disease in the horse.",1
"Résumé Après une présentation des techniques de récolte des macrophages alvéolaires par lavage pulmonaire réalisé post mortem ou sur porc anesthésié, plusieurs aspects caractéristiques de ces cellules sont décrits: adhérence in vitro, colorations enzymatiques et morphologie, phagocytose. L'étude du porcelet nouveau-né montre que les macrophages alvéolaires apparaissent au cours de la première semaine de vie. Enfin sont présentés les résultats ayant trait aux aspects immunologiques de ces cellules et à leurs interactions complexes avec les agents infectieux. Following a presentation of different methods used to collect alveolar macrophages by lung washing performed on killed or anaesthetized animals, several main features of these cells are described: in vitro adherence, enzymatic properties and morphology, phagocytosis. Studies of postnatal development show that swine alveolar macrophages appear during the first week of age. Finally, the alveolar macrophage immunological behaviour (surface receptors, cytotoxicity, co-operation with lymphocytes, activation) and the complex micro-organisms—macrophages inter-relationships are discussed.",1
"The conditioned infections due to opportunistic organisms, can be controlled by biological immunostimulators. The POLI-IF (Newcastle virus plus endotoxin of E. coli and Freund's incomplete adjuvant) rapidly induces the aspecific immunity. Given twice with 7–10 days interval in between, on occasion of a programmed stress (weaning, transport, crowding) it proved its efficacy in artificially suckled calves and in weaning piglets. The field trials, carried out on 2,782 treated calves in comparison with 2,909 untreated controls and on 4,387 piglets in comparison with 4,461 untreated controls, revealed statistically significant differences for P < 0.005 among the groups of treated and control animals. The immunostimulator reduced the incidence of the disease, dead and discarded animals, as well as it shortened the mean duration of the disease in single heads. Though the way the POLI-IF acts is not perfectly known so far, yet it increases the serum bactericidal activity and the circulating leukocytes, while it induces high levels of IFN. In our opinion the activity of the POLI-IF is bound to 3 factors at least: activation of the complementary fractions, mobilization of the immunocompetent cells, induction of IFN.",1
"Two groups of 3-month old calves were immunized intramuscularly with attenuated bovine rotavirus and boosted 21 and 42 days later. The first group of three calves were vaccinated with live virus emulsified with incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) and the second group was immunized with live virus suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Three other calves, serving as controls, were inoculated with PBS emulsified with IFA. The specific cell-mediated and antibody responses of the animals were studied. Preliminary analysis of in vitro peripheral blood lymphocyte transformation to bovine rotavirus determined optimal conditions as: 96 h culture period, 5 × 105 cells per culture in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated bovine fetal serum and the use of inactivated virus in the cell culture at a concentration of 5 × 106 median tissue culture infective dose before inactivation. Specific blastic stimulation was observed on calves immunized with the rotavirus emulsified with IFA after the second and third vaccine inoculation with stimulation index values varying from 2.00 to 5.73. Serum neutralizing antibody titers of 1 25,600 were also induced in the same calves. Calves immunized with rotavirus-PBS suspension developed a mean antibody titer of 1 1,600 , but showed no specific lymphocyte stimulation. No increase in specific immune responses was detected in the control animals.",1
"This presentation summarizes the results of a comprehensive study on rotaviruses isolated in Italy from calves and rabbits affected by neonatal diarrhea. The results clearly indicated that rotavirus infection is widespread and supported the evidence for an etiologic role of these viruses in neonatal diarrhea. The evidence of differences in virulence among bovine rotaviruses appeared also to be confirmed. Conventionally reared calves were fully susceptible to the experimental infection induced by three rotaviruses originating from heterologous hosts, i.e. monkeys, pigs and rabbits, respectively. When rotavirus strains of bovine, simian, porcine and rabbit origin were compared by cross neutralization tests, it was found the simian and porcine strains were indistinguishable and both appeared to relate antigenically to the bovine strain. On the other hand, a reciprocal antigenic correlation was found between bovine and rabbit isolates. Finally, it was proven that feeding newborn calves with colostrum of their dams, previously vaccinated with an inactivated rotavirus vaccine, could prevent the neonatal diarrhea from occurring.",1
"The immune response to the K99 was tested in 45 pregnant cows, subcutaneously vaccinated, for protecting the newborn calves. Serological tests were performed in the blood sera of all animals and in the milk and colostrum sera; hemogram, inhibition of the adhesion to the brush border and histological tests were performed. The calves from vaccinated cows survived the experimental infection after the suction of colostrum in spite of the fact that the calves from control dams died with diarrhea.",1
"Résumé L'apparition subite et généralisée de manifestations de fièvre, d'anorexie et de toux sur un groupe de truies nullipares dans un élevage dont les animaux sont par ailleurs l'objet d'un protocole d'étude, a justifié la mise en place d'un dispositif particulier d'observation. Les signes cliniques sont enregistrés quotidiennement et notamment la température rectale. Une cinétique sérologique est réalisée et les anticorpos anti Aujeszky, coronavirus GET-like, grippe, A/H1N1, grippe A/H3N2 et Mycoplasma hypopneumoniae sont recherchés. Des recherches virales sont conduites sur mucosités nasales d'animaux en hyperthermie ainsi que sur avortons. L'étude clinique montre une hyperthermie plus ou moins prononcée sur les animaux, les troubles persistant généralement 2 à 5 jours. Le diagnostic de grippe mettant en cause le virus H1N1 swine apparenté A/FIN/1/82 a été établi à la fois par la sérologie (séroconversion) et la mise en évidence du virus sur écouvillon nasal ainsi que sur avorton. L'examen des poumons de truies réformées après l'épisode grippal montre des lésions étendues de Bronchopneumonie et Pasteurella multocida est mise en évidence. Les conséquences zootechniques ont été considérables en particulier chez les truies venant d'être mises à la reproduction. Ainsi sur 13 truies inséminées depuis moins d'une semaine, 3 mise bas seulement on été obtenues. Elles comportent 5,5 et 12 porcelets. 7 truies sont revenues en chaleurs et enfin 3 diagnostiquées vides à 21 jours par échotomographie ont été réformées et examinées à l'abattoir. Sur 8 truies inséminées depuis environ un mois et confirmées gestantes, 2 résorptions embryonnaires sont intervenues, les 6 autres truies donnant naissance à des portées normales. Enfin sur 18 truies gestantes de plus de 45 jours, un avortement a été observé. Pathological consequences of a severe outbreak of swine influenza (H1N1 virus) in the non immune sow at the beginning of pregnancy, under natural conditions. A sudden acute outbreak of fever, depression, anorexia and coughing in a group of nulliparous sows from a herd that was currently under epidemiological investigation lead to build a particular disposal of observation. The clinical signs were daily recorded including rectal temperature. Blood was taken from the sows at the beginning of the troubles and 3 weeks later for the detection of Aujesky's disease, coronavirus TGE-like, Influenza viruses A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae. Viral detection was attempted from nasal swabs and aborted fetuses during the acute phase. The clinical study showed fever reaching near 41°C on most of the pigs and lasting usually from 2 to 5 days. The diagnosis of Influenza (virus swine H1N1) was established both on serology (massive seroconversion) and on the detection of the virus from the nasal swabs and from an aborted fetus. The control of the lungs of sows “not in pig” and culled showed extended lesions of bronchopneumonia and Pasteurella multocida was found. The technical consequences of this severe outbreak of Influenza on reproduction were mainly important at the beginning of pregnancy. Over 13 sows inseminated less than 1 week before the outbreak, only 3 farrowed (respectively 5,5 and 12 piglets); 7 returned to oestrus and 3 “not a pig” at 21 days (echotomography) did not show signs of heat and were culled. Over 8 pregnant sows (1 month of pregnancy), 6 farrowed normal litters and total embryonic resorption occurred in 2 sows. Over 18 pregnant sows (more than 45 days gestation) one aborted.",1
"Monoclonal antibodies have been produced against the 81/36F strain of rotavirus. One of them, was chosen as diagnostic reagent: it showed high ELISA reactivity with all the bovine, human and porcine rotavirus strains tested and reacted with VP6, structural protein product known to support the common rotavirus antigen. A sandwich ELISA procedure using the chosen monoclonal as “capture and detecting” antibody was performed to detect rotavirus in faecal samples from experimentally inoculated newborn calves: it always gave a negative response with meconium and a positive response for the stool specimens which rotavirus have been isolated. This assay was compared with Enzygnost and Slidex Rota Kit tests and with a non-commercial sandwich ELISA test using polyclonal antibodies: it showed more sensitivity than the agglutination test and was as sensitive as the other two tests to detect rotavirus in routine diagnostic material. The test evaluated showed no equivocal results.",1
"From the reasons that canine coronavirus (CCV) grows more efficiently than feline coronavirus in a cell culture and they are mutually related in their antigenicities, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using CCV-infected feline kidney (CRFK) cells as substrate antigens was developed for detection of anti-coronavirus antibodies in cats. It was indispensable for generating coronavirus-specific ELISA antibody activities that the sample was applied to the mock-infected, normal CRFK cells in parallel with the CCV-infected cells and then the optical density values given by the mock-infected cell antigen were subtracted from those given by the virus-infected cell antigen. On the basis of ELISA antibody titers obtained in sera from the cats experimentally infected with CCV and from the spontaneous feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) cases, the ELISA described in the present study was found to be applicable as a simple and easy serologic test which was able to detect anti-coronavirus antibodies as efficiently as the indirect immunofluorescence assay with homologous FIP virus.",1
"A review is given about pathogenetic and clinical aspects of the well-known as well as of recently detected members of the family Coronaviridae. Special attention is paid to coronavirus infections of domestic cattle and pets, whereas avian, murine, rat and human coronaviruses are summarized briefly.",1
"Infections caused by BHV1 are very common in Europe, but the disease pattern is quite different: the diseases of the genital tract are most common, those of the respiratory tract vary in intensity and prevalence. Digestive disorders connected with BHV1 are in general only observed in calves and mainly in Belgium. Virus strains causing abortion or encephalitis are only present in a few countries. The same is true for BHV1 induced mastitis. Dermatitis and lesions in the interdigital space seem to be a rare event. BHV1 infections are frequently complicated by bacterial secondary infections, but there is evidence that BHV1 infections can occur simultaneously with bovine virus diarrhoea (BVD) and/or parainfluenza-3 (PI 3) virus. The biggest problem associated with BHV1 infection is the ability of the agent to become latent following a primary infection. The genome of the virus probably remains during the life of the animal in the ganglia of the region where the primary infection occurred. No vaccination can overcome this latent stage. By prophylactic vaccination it is possible to prevent an outbreak of clinical disease but it is impossible to prevent infection followed by the establishment of latency. Eradication programmes in Austria, Denmark and Switzerland have removed most of the seropositive cattle from the bovine populations. Currently a sanitary programme is also being conducted in Germany.",1
"Alveolar macrophages (AM) infected with Pseudorabies virus (PRV) were compared to noninfected AM for cytotoxicity against foreign or transformed cells and production of interferon (IFN). Five PRV strains were used to infect AM including strains that are known to be highly virulent for pigs, i.e. strain 4892 and strain S-62 as well as strains that are regarded as mild or nonvirulent, i.e. BUK and Bartha. The multiplicity of infection ranged from 0.005 to 0.05 TCID50/cell. The target cells in the cytotoxicity assays were either chicken red blood cells, PRV-infected vero cells, or human myeloblastoma cells (K562 cell line). For the producton of IFN, AM cultures were treated with polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) diluted in tissue culture media at a concentration of 5 μg/106 cells. Culture supernatants were collected at various times poststimulation and tested for antiviral activity using the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus replication inhibition test. Swine AM were able to lyse chicken red blood cells in an antibody-independent way but not in an antibody-dependent way, whereas lysis of PRV-infected vero cells was accomplished both ways. The cytotoxicity against chicken red blood cells was reduced in the PRV-infected AM as compared to noninfected cells, particularly in AM infected with virulent PRV strains. Specific 51Cr release values for AM infected with S-62 and 4892 strains were 14 and 19, while the noninfected AM had values of 36. Similarly, in the antibody-dependent cytotoxicity assay against PRV-infected vero cells there was no activity of AM against K562 cells. The production of IFN was readily stimulated with Poly I:C. The optimal time for supernatant collection was between 12 and 16h poststimulation. The antiviral activity was abrogated by treatment of the supernatant with antiserum against human leukocyte IFN; it was therefore considered to be due to interferon-alpha (IFNα) released from the macrophages. The antiviral activity present in supernatants of PRV-infected AM was reduced compared to noninfected AM. The difference between AM cultures infected with virulent strains of PRV and noninfected AM cultures was statistically significant at P ⩽ 0.025. The results provide support to the premise that the role of AM in lung defense can be compromised by PRV infection.",1
"Immunological features of feline lymphocytes, immunoglobulins, monocytes/macrophages, cytokines, major histocompatibility complex and delayed-type hypersensitivity are reviewed. Attention is given to the comparison of the feline immune system with the immune systems of humans and other animals. Also presented is information on the modification of feline immunity by pathogens.",1
Feline splenocytes were fused to the murine myeloma lines NSO or Ag8. Autologous serum and taurine were used as media supplements for the cat × mouse heterohybridomas. The best results were obtained by the use of NSO as fusion line with taurine-supported media.,1
"The effect of relative humidity (RH) and temperature on the survival of airborne bovine rotavirus UK isolate (BRV-UK) and a murine rotavirus (MRV) was studied. In any one experiment, the virus under test was suspended in tryptose phosphate broth (TPB) supplemented with uranine (physical tracer) and an antifoam, was aerosolized using a Collison nebulizer into the rotating drum with the RH at either low (30 ± 5%), medium (50 + 5%) or high (80 ± 5%) level at 20 ± 1°C. Following a 15-min period of viral aerosol stabilization, sequential samples of drum air were collected using an All-Glass Impinger (AGI) for 24 h post-aerosolization. Both of the rotavirus isolates were found to survive best at medium RH level and high RH was found least favorable for the survival of these aerosolized rotaviruses. The survival pattern of aerosolized MRV was found to be the best when compared with survival pattern of all animal and human rotavirus isolates studies performed under aerosolized conditions in our laboratory. The findings of these experiments confirm and extend our previous reports on the survival of other animal and human aerosolized rotaviruses and emphasize the fact that air may be one of the vehicles for their dissemination and could explain why it is difficult to control nosocomial outbreaks of rotavirus gastroenteritis and to keep animal colonies rotavirus-free.",1
"The molecular basis of pathogenesis in vivo for a virulent mouse rotavirus (MRV) and a less virulent bovine rotavirus (BRV) were compared under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Obvious differences in the mobility of several genomic RNA segments were observed in one-dimensional gels. Under in vitro conditions, partial proteolytic peptide mapping identified differences between the two outer capsid proteins of these virus and no difference in inner capsid protein was observed. Since it has been observed by us and others that the gene coding for VP4 protein plays a significant role in determining virulence, the variability observed in the present study between the 84 k proteins (VP4) provided a basis for further investigations in order to locate a potential virulence determinant. A comparison of the carboxypeptidase digests of the MRV- and BRV-VP4 revealed an area of variability between amino acids 307 and 407, which may represent a site of virulence determinant. Under in vivo conditions the virulence of both parenteral BRV and MRV isolates and their corresponding reassortants (with replaced gene 4) were studied in murine and bovine hosts. Like their parents, BRV and MRV isolates, reassortants obtained by replacement of gene 4 in BRV with MRV gene 4 indicated that the dose of the virus isolate used and the clinical outcome in vivo was determined by gene segment 4. The implications of these findings to elucidate the molecular basis of pathogenesis of rotaviruses are discussed.",1
"A preliminary study was conducted to determine the cellular immune status of neonatal, colostrum-deprived calves following inoculation with either attenuated or virulent bovine coronavirus (BCV). Uninfected calves served as controls. To determine the intestinal and systemic cellular immune status, we performed MHC-restricted cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) assay on mesenteric lymphocytes, enumerated T cell subsets in peripheral blood lymphocytes, and examined histopathological alterations in mesenteric lymph nodes and gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Target cells for the CTL assay were autologous testicular cells and effector cells were mesenteric lymphocytes from calves infected with BCV. No appreciable specific lysis was observed in any group of calves indicating the absence of demonstrable CTL responses. The TC/TS population was severely depressed in the calf inoculated with the virulent virus but not in those inoculated with either the attenuated virus or placebo. The mesenteric lymph nodes and Peyer's patches of calves inoculated with the virulent virus showed severe depletion of lymphocytes. These calves developed intestinal antibody responses in the acute phase of infection (1 week after infection) but were immunosuppressed in the later stage of infection.",1
"A preliminary study was conducted to compare the regional intestinal immune responses of neonatal calves inoculated with virulent or attenuated bovine coronavirus (BCV) to determine the cause of reported vaccine failures. A group of 9 newborn, colostrum-deprived calves was used; two calves were inoculated with attenuated virus, four calves were infected with virulent virus (including one naturally infected calf), and three calves were uninfected controls. Calves inoculated with virulent virus produced higher titers of BCV antibodies in the intestines than those inoculated with the attenuated virus. The failure of the calves to respond to the attenuated virus was apparently due to the inability of the virus to replicate to high titers. Spiral colon, ileum, and jejunum were found to be immunologically distinct; the highest anti-BCV antibody responses were detected in spiral colon, the primary site of infection, and involved all four isotypes of bovine immunoglobulins. The antibody response in ileum was lower than in spiral colon. The immune responses developed slowly in jejunum and were associated primarily with the IgG subtypes.",1
"Twelve cattle with body wts ranging from 100 to 250 kg were treated using various doses and routes for four days with an E. coli derived alpha-hybrid interferon. The lowest parenteral doses (104 units per kg body wt) and the orally administered interferon did not lead to any disturbances, whereas the higher dosages led to marked changes in body temperature, pulse and respiration rates. Animals with the highest dose (108 units per kg body wt) became extremely distressed. The blood picture showed distinct changes, with very low leukocyte counts during treatment, which took weeks to recover. It is suggested that the dosages that did not lead to clinical symptoms are best suited for prophylactic or therapeutic purposes.",1
"Five conventionally kept calves aged between 17 and 24 days were experimentally infected with bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) by aerosol in order to mimic the natural infection route. The calves were killed and autopsies performed 7 days after the first virus challenge. The BRSV isolate used induced tracheitis, bronchitis and atelectasis in infected calves. The only virus which could be isolated from the lungs of the calves was BRSV. In addition, Mycoplasma bovirhinis was isolated from the lung or/and trachea of two calves. The clinical and histopathological findings, as well as the detection of BRSV antigens by immunofluorescence in the epithelial cells of lung and trachea, and the reisolation of the virus from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids of all inoculated calves, provided confirmation of successful infection with BRSV.",1
"136 fecal samples, collected from 47 dairy calves on a calf ranch and in a dairy herd in California, were tested for the presence of group A and group B rotaviruses by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Samples were collected from each calf at days 1, 7 and 14. Within the 14 day period, 44 calves (94%) were positive for group A rotavirus and an unexpectedly high number of calves (38 calves, 81%) were positive for group B rotavirus. When these samples were examined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), rotavirus was found in 21 calves and all of them had group A electropherotype. Among 25 PAGE positive samples from 21 calves, 17 (68%) were of short electropherotype, 4 (28%) were of long electropherotype and 4 (28%) contained both short and long electropherotype rotaviruses. Group B and short and long electropherotype group A rotaviruses were found in both normal and diarrheic calves.",1
"Objectives: The aims of this article were: to summarize the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy ofdaptomycin; to explore its safety profile; and to discuss its current and potential roles as an antimicrobial therapy. Methods: A literature search was conducted using the MEDLINE (1966–August 2004) and InternationalPharmaceutical Abstracts (1970–August 2004) databases with the search terms daptomycin, LY146032, and lipopeptide antibiotics. Abstracts of the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy and documents submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration were also reviewed. Results: Phase III study results suggest no difference in efficacy or tolerability between daptomycin 4 mg/kgIV QD and vancomycin or semisynthetic penicillins for complicated skin and skin-structure infections. Animal studies suggest daptomycin may be useful for the treatment of endocarditis. Daptomycin is not indicated for pneumonia, with poorer outcomes than conventional treatment It is available as an IV medication and exhibits 92% plasma protein binding in vitro. In healthy adult humans, daptomycin has a volume of distribution of 0.1 Ukg and a plasma elimination half-life of ∼9 hours, and is eliminated primarily by renal excretion (∼54%). In patients with reduced renal function, including those receiving hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, the dose interval should be 48 hours. No dosage adjustment appears to be necessary for mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The use of daptomycin in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been assessed. The most commonly reported adverse events include constipation, nausea, injection-site reactions, headache, and diarrhea. Patients should also be monitored regularly for skeletal muscle toxicity. Conclusions: Daptomycin may be useful for complicated skin and skin-structure infections and gram-positive pathogens resistant to conventional antimicrobials. However, limited data are currently available for duration of treatment beyond 14 days and at doses >4 mg/kg QD.",1
"To study the antigenic structure of the peplomer protein of the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus, fragments from the peplomer gene were generated by restriction-enzyme cleavage or by limited DNase digestion and inserted in the Escherichia coli expression plasrnid pEX (Stanley and Luzio, 1984). The antigenicity of the expression products was tested using a number of polyclonal antisera and monoclonal antibodies. The polyclonal antisera recognized different sets of epitopes in the 1162-residue sequence. The N-terminal region of one of the two subunits, S2, was recognized by all polyclonal sera and by two monoclonal antibodies. This clearly immunodominant region contains at least two adjacent or overlapping epitopes, one of which has been localized within 18 residues. The epitopes found as antigenic pEX expression products do not coincide with the regions in the S1 subunit that have been found to contain hypervariable sequences. We suggest that these regions constitute conformation dependent neutralization epitopes that cannot be detected in the pEX system. The relevance of our finclings for vaccine development is discussed.",1
"In recent years, there has been increased recognition of the importance of viral infections. In addition, new antiviral agents have become available. These factors have led to a marked increase in utilization of viral diagnositc services. In this review, both conventional and rapid methods for viral diagnosis are presented, with emphasis on recent advances. The antiviral agents currently available and the major drugs under investigation are also briefly discussed. It is hoped that this review will serve as a useful adjunct for the management of patients with virus infections.",1
"In recent years, knowledge of the physiology and pharmacology of hepatic circulation has grown rapidly. Liver microcirculation has a unique design that allows very efficient exchange processes between plasma and liver cells, even when severe constraints are imposed upon the system, i.e. in stressful situations. Furthermore, it has been recognized recently that sinusoids and their associated cells can no longer be considered only as passive structures ensuring the dispersion of molecules in the liver, but represent a very sophisticated network that protects and regulates parenchymal cells through a variety of mediators. Finally, vascular abnormalities are a prominent feature of a number of liver pathological processes, including cirrhosis and liver cell necrosis whether induced by alcohol, ischemia, endotoxins, virus or chemicals. Although it is not clear whether vascular lesions can be the primary events that lead to hepatocyte injury, the main interest of these findings is that liver microcirculation could represent a potential target for drug action in these conditions.",1
"Interferons (IFNs) are critical components of the host immune system, serving as antiviral agents, immunomodulators and inhibitors of cell growth. Among peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the primary IFN-α-producing cell is a light density, HLA-DR+ cell negative for cell surface markers typical for T cells, B cells, monocytes, natural-killer or progenitor cells and has been tentatively the ‘natural’ IFN-producing cell' or NIPC. Although present in very low frequency (approximately 1:1000 among peripheral blood mononuclear cells), the NIPC are very potent, with an individual cell able to produce 1–2 IU of IFN. In this review, the characteristics, phenotype, regulation and relationship of NIPC to human disease are discussed.",1
"During the last decade intensive work on the relationships between the liver and the arachidonic acid cascade has greatly expanded our knowledge of this area of research. The liver has emerged as the major organ participating in the degradation and elimination of arachidonate products of systemic origin. The synthesis in the liver of arachidonate products derived from the cfyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase and cytochrome P450 system pathways has been demonstrated. The participation of leukotriene B4 and cysteinyl-leukotrienes as mediators of liver damage and the possible therapeutic usefulness of prostaglandins (PGs) in acute liver injury has attracted the interest of clinicians. This article reviews the essential features regarding the role of arachidonate metabolites in liver disease and specially focuses on the cytoprotective effects on the liver displayed by PGE2, PGE1, PGI2 and synthetic PG analogs in experimental models of liver damage induced by ischemia-reperfusion injury, carbon tetrachloride, bacterial lipopolysaccharide and viral hepatitis and on the possible mechanisms underlying liver cytoprotection in these experimental models. The therapeutic usefulness of PGs in clinical practice is critically analyzed on the basis of available evidence in patients with fulminant hepatic failure and primary graft nonfunction following liver transplantation.",1
"Picornaviruses are among the best understood animal viruses in molecular terms. A number of important human and animal pathogens are members of the Picornaviridae family. The genome organization, the different steps of picornavirus growth and numerous compounds that have been reported as inhibitors of picornavirus functions are reviewed. The picornavirus particles and several agents that interact with them have been solved at atomic resolution, leading to computer-assisted drug design. Picornavirus inhibitors are useful in aiding a better understanding of picornavirus biology. In addition, some of them are promising therapeutic agents. Clinical efficacy of agents that bind to picornavirus particles has already been demonstrated.",1
"The mating of CBA/j♀ mice (H2k) by DBA/2j♂ mice (H2d) typically results in an elevated incidence of spontaneous embryo loss thus providing an ideal genetically controlled laboratory model for the study of the factors causing early embryo loss during pregnancy. There is now considerable data on the cells and factors involved in fetal resorption but little is known about the events which activate this process. While the activation of the maternal response to the fetal implant could have endogenous or genetic origins, a role for exogenous factors including microbial pathogens could also be involved. In order to investigate these possibilities, the reproductive success of CBA/j♀ × DBA/2j♂ matings in a conventional animal care facility were compared with matings in a specific pathogen free (SPF) animal facility. All animals housed under these conditions were routinely screened by immunoassay and culture, for the presence of a number of viral and bacterial pathogens of mice. The incidence of spontaneous embryo loss in specific pathogen free CBA female mice mated by DBA and other male strains was found to be virtually identical to that of CBA female mice infected with multiple viral pathogens and housed under otherwise identical conditions (non-SPF). However, the numbers of implantation per pregnancy was significantly greater in an SPF facility. Therefore, exposure of mating mice to exogenous viral and bacterial pathogens did not appear to alter the overall incidence of spontaneous embryo resorption. It was concluded that the immunomodulatory effects of infection by common murine pathogens neither augmented nor reduced post-implantation embryo losses.",1
"Serum titers of virus-neutralizing (VN) antibody were 10 to 16 times higher in neonatal pigs than in young adult pigs, after single oral doses of virulent transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). To determine the reason for this higher response, sera from neonatal and young adult pigs, 18 to 21 days after exposure to TGEV, were collected and assayed for VN antibody by plaque reduction. In addition, sera of VN-positive and VN-negative neonatal pigs were analyzed for immunoglobulin classes by radial immunodiffusion technique. The competence of neonatal pigs to produce VN antibody with increased IgG levels was demonstrated. The higher antibody response seen in neonatal pigs, when compared to sera of young adult pigs, may be attributed to the increased replication of TGEV in the intestinal tracts of neonatal pigs or to the lack of other immunogens that may interfere or compete with the production of specific antibody.",1
"Class-specific antibodies against bovine IgG1, IgG2, IgM and IgA and porcine IgG, IgM and IgA immunoglobulins were prepared. Their class specificity was assessed by two radioimmunological methods, namely, radioimmunoelectrophoresis and double antibody sandwich radioimmunoassay. The methods are highly specific and sensitive and do not require the use of purified immunoglobulins, but can be performed with normal serum or colostrum. It was confirmed that antibodies found satisfactory in these tests were suitable for a wide range of use including radioimmunoassay and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.",1
Lymphocyte blast transformation assays (LBT) were performed on canine parvovirus (CPV) -positive and -negative mongrel dogs randomly selected from a humane facility. Concanavalin A as well as Phytohemagglutinin P stimulation was depressed (p<0.001) in the group of animals shedding CPV compared to CPV-negative dogs.,1
"The intestinal and systemic antibody response of calves vaccinated and/or challenged with rotavirus was studied employing isotype-specific ELISAs for the detection of IgG1, IgG2, IgM and IgA antibodies to rotavirus. Monoclonal antibodies to bovine immunoglobulin isotypes of proven specificity were used as conjugated or catching antibody. Five days after oral inoculation (dpi) of a 5-day-old gnotobiotic calf with rotavirus, IgM rotavirus antibodies were excreted in faeces, followed 5 days later by IgA rotavirus antibodies. The increase in IgM rotavirus antibody titre coincided with the inability to detect further rotavirus excretion. Faeces IgM and IgA rotavirus antibody titres fell to low levels within 3 weeks post infection. IgG1 and IgG2 rotavirus antibodies were not detected in faecal samples. In serum, antibodies to rotavirus of all four isotypes were detected, starting with IgM at 5 dpi. Two SPF-calves, which were fed colostrum free of rotavirus antibodies, were vaccinated with a modified live rotavirus vaccine and challenged with virulent rotavirus 6 days later. Upon vaccination, the calves showed an antibody response similar to the response of the infected gnotobiotic calf. Intestinal IgM rotavirus antibodies were excreted before or on the day of challenge and appeared to be associated with protection against challenge infection with virulent virus and rotavirus-induced diarrhoea. In 3 control calves, which were challenged only, the antibody patterns also resembled that of the gnotobiotic calf and again the appearance of IgM rotavirus antibodies coincided with the end of the rotavirus detection period. Two other groups of 3 SPF-calves were treated similarly, but the calves were fed colostrum with rotavirus antibodies during the first 48 h of life. These calves excreted passively acquired IgG1 and IgG2 rotavirus antibodies in their faeces from 2 to 6 days after birth. After vaccination, no IgM or IgA antibody activity in serum or faeces was detectable. Upon challenge, all calves developed diarrhoea and excreted rotavirus. Seven to 10 days after challenge low levels of IgM rotavirus antibody were detected for a short period. These data indicate that the intestinal antibody response of young calves to an enteric viral infection is associated with the excretion of IgM antibodies, immediately followed by IgA antibodies. This response is absent or diminished in calves with passively acquired specific antibodies which may explain the failure to induce a protective intestinal immune response by oral vaccination with modified live rotavirus of calves fed colostrum containing rotavirus antibodies.",1
"Kittens immunized with purified native FeLV-gp70 or -gp85 envelope proteins developed ELISA, but not virus neutralizing, antibodies in their serum to both whole FeLV and FeLV-gp70. Kittens vaccinated with envelope proteins and infected with feline sarcoma virus (FeSV) developed smaller tumors than nonvaccinates, but a greater incidence of persistent retroviremia. Similarly, FeLV-gp70 and -gp85 vaccinated kittens were more apt to become persistently retroviremic following virulent FeLV challenge exposure than nonvaccinates. Kittens vaccinated with inactivated whole FeLV developed smaller tumors after FeSV inoculation and had a lower incidence of persistent retroviremia than nonvaccinates. The protective effect of inactivated whole FeLV vaccine against persistent retroviremia was also seen with FeLV challenge-exposed cats. Protection afforded by inactivated whole FeLV vaccine was not associated with virus neutralizing antibodies, although ELISA antibodies to both whole FeLV and FeLV-gp70 were induced by vaccination.",1
"Lymph node cells from calves immunized with purified pilus antigen of K99+ enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) were fused with mouse myeloma (NSO) cells, and with non-Ig producing mouse/calf hybridomas or with a bovine Ig-producing mouse/calf/calf secondary hybridoma. Lines secreting bovine monoclonal IgG1 specific for K99 pilus antigen in an ELISA were obtained in each case. The two lines derived from xenohybridoma fusion partners have been secreting anti-K99 bovine monoclonal antibody for over one year in continual passage. None of the antibodies cross-reacted with other pilus types including K88, CFAI, CFAII, 987P or CP; they all inhibited agglutination of horse RBC (which have a K99 receptor) in the presence of K99 antigen; they showed positive fluorescence in an indirect binding assay on K99+ ETEC and inhibited K99+ ETEC adhesion to piglet enterocytes. These antibodies have potential prophylactic and therapeutic use in control and treatment of diarrhoea.",1
"Studies are described in which hybridoma technology is used to produce a variety of reagents for the characterization and manipulation of the bovine humoral immune system. Selected members of a set of murine monoclonal antibodies (MAb) specific for each of four major isotypes of bovine Ig constant regions, one specific for anti-bovine Ig constant regions as well as one specific for anti-bovine light chains are discussed. Interspecific fusion of bovine lymphocytes with the established mouse cell line, SP2/0 was used to produce a collection of stable hybridomas among which were found secretors of bovine IgG1, IgG2, IgM, IgA and bovine light chain. Interspecific fusion of SP2/0 with lymphocytes from a multiparous Holstein four days post immunization with Streptococcus agalactiae yielded MAb with specificity for the immunizing antigen. One of these hybridomas, LHRB 19.17, which displayed a particularly stable secretory phenotype, was used as an immunogen for the production of a library of murine monoclonal anti-idiotype antibodies. Competitive antigen binding analysis showed that 15 of the 24 anti-LHRB 19.17 idiotype antibodies isolated blocked the binding of the idiotype to its nominal antigen and so were candidates for evaluation as antigen mimics. Some of the ways in which monoclonal anti-idiotypes in particular, and monoclonal in general, might be of use in problems of animal disease are discussed.",1
"Transfer of functional blood IgG1 to the gastrointestinal tract was measured in neonatal calves. Radiolabelled immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) anti-DNP antibody was administered to 2 day old calves by intravenous injection. The serum clearance rate was measured and was compared to the rate of protein-bound 125I excretion in the feces over a 10 day period to determine the importance of transfer to the gastrointestinal tract as a mechanism of serum IgG1 clearance. The amount of protein-bound and DNP-binding 125I present in the gastrointestinal tract of 10 day old calves at necropsy was also measured. Fecal excretion of protein-bound 125I accounted for 32% of the serum 125I-IgG1 clearance. Protein-bound 125I was present in the gastrointestinal tract at necropsy in amounts estimated to account for 68% of the total 125I-IgG1 clearance, and retained 65% of the DNP-binding ability of the original antibody. The discrepancy between the fecal excretion (32% of total IgG1 clearance) and the GI clearance estimated from protein-bound 125I in the gut (68% of total IgG1 clearance) is explained in part by IgG1 proteolysis occurring after transfer to the gastrointestinal tract but before fecal excretion. These results indicate that transfer to the calf gastrointestinal tract accounts for most IgG1 clearance in young calves, and that the intestinal antibody retains antigen binding function and may contribute to intestinal immunity.",1
"Unsuckled specific pathogen free calves were inoculated at 3–4 weeks of age, either intranasally (IN) or orally (O) with bovine coronavirus or O plus IN (O/IN) or O with bovine rotavirus. Shedding of virus in nasal or fecal samples, and virus-infected nasal epithelial cells were detected using immunofluorescent staining (IF), ELISA or immune electron microscopy (IEM). Isotype-specific antibody titers in sera, nasal and fecal samples were determined by ELISA. Calves inoculated with coronavirus shed virus in feces and virus was detected in nasal epithelial cells. Nasal shedding persisted longer in IN-inoculated calves than in O-inoculated calves and longer than fecal shedding in both IN and O-inoculated calves. Diarrhea occurred in all calves, but there were no signs of respiratory disease. Calves inoculated with rotavirus had similar patterns of diarrhea and fecal shedding, but generally of shorter duration than in coronavirus-inoculated calves. No nasal shedding of rotavirus was detected. Peak IgM antibody responess, in most calves, were detected in fecal and nasal speciments at 7–10 days post-exposure (DPE), preceeding peak IgA responses which occurred at 10–14 DPE. The nasal antibody responses occurred in all virus-inoculated calves even in the absence of nasal shedding of virus in rotavirus-inoculated calves. Calves inoculated with coronavirus had higher titers of IgM and IgA antibodies in fecal and nasal samples than rotavirus-inoculated calves. In most inoculated calves, maximal titers of IgM or IgA antibodies correlated with the cessation of fecal or nasal virus shedding. A similar sequence of appearance of IgM and IgA antibodies occurred in serum, but IgA antibodies persisted for a shorter period than in fecal or nasal samples. Serum IgG1 antibody responses generally preceeded IgG2 responses and were predominant in most calves after 14–21 DPE.",1
"The development of three separate rapid ELISAs for detecting antibodies in host serum to three different viruses is described. These include: 1. 1.|A direct antigen assay using enzyme labelled anti-canine Ig for detecting antibodies to canine parvovirus, 2. 2.|A competitive ELISA using a feline infectious peritonitis virus-specific monoclonal antibody labelled with enzyme, and 3. 3.|A competitive ELISA using an equine infectious anemia virus-specific monoclonal antibody and enzyme labelled antigen, p. 26. The utility and benefits of each of the three approaches is emphasized.",1
"Recombinant porcine interferon gamma (rPoIFNγ) induced a dose-dependent inhibition of the cytopathic effect produced by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) challenge of both homologous and heterologous (bovine) cell lines. In addition, an antiviral effect of rPoIFNγ was demonstrable against the coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection of porcine epithelial cells and of pulmonary macrophages. A rabbit anti-PoIFNγ antiserum was prepared and shown to specifically neutralize the antiviral effects of natural and recombinant porcine IFNγ preparations. This antiserum could also neutralize recombinant bovine IFNγ but not recombinant human IFNγ. These results suggest antigenic homology of porcine and bovine IFNγ but antigenic differences between these molecules and human IFNγ.",1
"A heterohybridoma was produced by the fusion of sensitized peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) with a previously derived heteromyeloma, generated by the fusion of bovine PBLs with murine myeloma cells. The sensitized bovine PBLs were collected from a steer immunized with an oestradiol-ovalbumin conjugate. The cell lines resulting from the fusion were screened for the production of bovine antibodies to oestradiol. A stable heterohybridoma was isolated which secreted a bovine IgG1 to oestrone/oestradiol. The use of sensitized PBLs together with heteromyeloma fusion partners has proved to be a reliable and simple way of producing monoclonal antibodies against specific haptens.",1
"The lymphocyte populations of the bovine gut lamina proprial (LP) and epithelial tissues were isolated and characterized with respect to cells bearing surface and cytoplasmic immunoglobulin (Ig). Functional characteristics of cells from the two tissues, including responsiveness to Concanavalin A (Con A), anti-bovine immunoglobulin (anti-Ig), Con A supernatants of bovine peripheral blood lymphocytes (bConA sup) and recombinant human IL-2 (rhIL-2), were also assessed. Less than 1% of the mononuclear cells in the epithelial tissue (IEL) stained for cytoplasmic Ig, and 9% stained positively for surface Ig. IEL did not proliferate in response to anti-Ig, although cells of this population did respond to Con A, bConA sup, and rhIL-2. Twenty-seven percent of bovine gut LP lymphocytes stained for surface Ig, while 39% of these cells were positive for cytoplasmic Ig. LP lymphocytes proliferated in response to all four stimulants used, Con A, anti-Ig, bConA sup and rhIL-2.",1
"Natural killer (NK) cell activity in the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of newborn piglets, normally negligible, was stimulated by in vitro treatment with porcine type I interferon (IFN), and the NK activity of PBL from weaned piglets was augmented by the same treatment. Binding of the PBL to the PK-15 targets used in the single cell cytotoxicity assay for NK activity was not affected by age or by IFN treatment. When newborn piglets were treated with a single intravenous dose at 2 days of age of 0.5 mg/kg of polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid complexed with poly-L-lysine and carboxymethylcellulose (poly ICLC), a synthetic IFN inducer, their IFN levels peaked at 6 h post-induction, and NK activity in their PBL peaked at 24 h post-induction at the level normally found in weaned piglets. The NK activity then declined until 7 days post-induction, when it increased again in a similar manner to that in untreated control piglets. Target-binding of the PBL was not affected by poly ICLC treatment of the piglets. Newborn piglets treated with poly ICLC and subsequently exposed to infection with transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus showed a delay in onset of clinical signs of TGE compared with untreated control piglets. It was concluded that NK cells in newborn piglets can be activated by treatment of the piglets with poly ICLC, and that the presence of active NK cells is associated with some increase in resistance to challenge with TGE virus.",1
"Enzyme immunoassay has gained wide acceptance for serological diagnosis of bovine brucellosis because of its ability to detect antibody of all isotypes unlike the conventional tests. The indirect enzyme immunoassay, however, presents several parameters that require careful analysis. These parameters include the choice of antigen and antiglobulin-enzyme conjugate reagents for use in the assay, dealing with the large amount of data the semi-automatic or automatic assay can generate and the inter-and intralaboratory standardization and quality control. This review considers the various methods described in the literature and, briefly, how some of the problems have been overcome or how they might be dealt with.",1
"Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH)-like reactions to feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus (FIPV) were induced in the skin of nine cats that were asymptomatic after a previous challenge-exposure with FIPV. Four of the nine previously challenge-exposed cats were negative for virus-neutralizing antibodies against FIPV at the time of intradermal (ID) testing for DTH. Two other cats tested for DTH when acutely ill with clinical FIP did not have cutaneous DTH responses to FIPV. Gross skin reactions to FIPV injected ID were observed in six of nine asymptomatic cats (67%) at postintradermal inoculation hours (PIH) 24, 48, and/or 72. The reactions consisted of focal, 1–5-mm to 2.5-cm diameter indurated or semi-firm, nonerythematous, slightly raised nodules. Microscopically, DTH-like reactions were observed in biopsies taken from the FIPV-inoculated skin of asymptomatic cats at PIH 24 to 72. The lesions consisted of perivascular and diffuse dermal infiltrations by macrophages, lymphocytes, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). The dermal infiltrates, which were maximal at PIH 48 or 72, were predominantly mixed inflammatory cells (five of nine cats) or PMN (four of nine cats) at PIH 24, but later were predominantly mononuclear cells (six of nine cats) or mixed inflammatory cells (two of nine cats) at PIH 72. Five of nine cats (56%) with positive DTH skin responses had increased survival times after lethal ID challenge-exposure with FIPV compared to mean survival times in FIPV-naive, non-immune control cats that were DTH-negative when ID challenge-exposed. Four of nine DTH-positive cats (44%) resisted an ID challenge-exposure dose of FIPV that was fatal in both control cats, and two of the four remaining DTH-positive cats survived a third challenge-exposure with highly lethal doses of FIPV given intraperitoneally. Four of the six DTH-positive cats (67%) that died after re-challenge and were necropsied had lesions of noneffusive FIP, suggesting that cellular immunity may also be involved in the pathogenesis of noneffusive disease, whereas both control cats and both DTH-negative cats with clinical disease succumbed to effusive FIP. Seemingly, DTH responses to FIPV can be associated with an increased level of resistance to disease; however, this state of immunity is variable and apparently can be lost with time in some cats.",1
"The development of a bovine monoclonal antibody against Brucella abortus smooth lipopolysaccharide (BM-8) by interspecies fusion of bovine peripheral lymphocytes from an immunized cow and a murine plasmacytoma cell line is described. The twice cloned cell line secreted bovine IgG1 subclass antibody. Ascites fluid was prepared in pristane treated nu/nu mice by intraperitoneal injection. The pooled ascites fluid was purified by affinity chromatography and the functions of the antibody assessed in various serological tests. The BM-8 antibody did not agglutinate well at a neutral pH, however, under acid conditions it was efficient at agglutinating B. abortus cells. The antibody did not precipitate B. abortus LPS in double agar gel immunodiffusion but was very active in the direct complement fixation test and the indirect enzyme immunoassay, although it was unable to compete with a murine monoclonal antibody in a competitive enzyme immunoassay.",1
"The requirement for monoclonal antibodies derived from species other than rats and mice is becoming increasingly realised in veterinary, as well as human, medicine. This paper reviews current knowledge of the production of inter-species hybridomas (heterohybridomas) by the fusion of rodent myeloma cell lines with lymphocytes from species of veterinary importance. To date a number of monoclonal immunoglobulins derived from sheep, cattle, pig, rabbit, mink and primate species have been produced to a variety of different bacterial, viral and nematode pathogens as well as to blood group and MHC determinants and to hormones. The technique opens up a number of possibilities for the future; some of these applications are discussed in relation to the antibodies produced thus far.",1
"After carbonyl iron treatment and gradient isolation, spleen and blood pig lymphocytes exhibited NK activity and produced IFN after viral induction. Removal of plastic-adherent cells, including the majority of B cells, did not change these activities. The plastic-non-adherent cells were further separated into two subsets of roughly similar size by panning using a monoclonal, anti-T, and anti-null cell antibodies (81+cells). NK activity and IFN production were found in the 81 − cell fraction. A significantly higher proportion of null lymphocytes from blood and of splenic Fc-gamma receptor-bearing lymphocytes was also found among the 81 − cell fraction as compared to the 81 + fraction, without any change among other subsets. Similar proportions of helper (PT4+), cytotoxic (PT8+) and total T cells (MSA4+) were found among lymphocytes bound to target K562 cells and among the whole lymphocyte population. In contrast, lymphocytes that bound K562 cells demonstrated a striking increase in the proportion of Fc-gamma receptor-positive cells of high affinity. These results show that NK cells and IFN-producing cells are mainly included in the same blood and spleen fraction, and suggest that among 81 − cells only those expressing an Fc-gamma receptor of high affinity are active.",1
"More than 2000 cats sent for necropsy in order to provide a diagnosis were investigated immunohistologically using paraffin sections for the presence of a persistent infection with feline leukemia virus (FeLV). The spectrum of neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases associated significantly with FeLV infection was determined statistically. Three-quarters of the cats with persistent FeLV infections died of non-neoplastic diseases and about 23% died of tumors, nearly exclusively those of the leukemia/lymphoma disease complex. A strong association with liver degeneration, icterus and a FeLV-associated enteritis was found in addition to the known association with non-neoplastic diseases and conditions such as anemia, bacterial secondary infections and respiratory tract inflammations due to the immunosuppressive effect of FeLV, hemorrhages and feline infectious peritonitis. Surprisingly, diseases and conditions like feline infectious panleukopenia, enteritis (of other types than FeLV-associated enteritis and feline infectious panleukopenia), glomerulonephritis, uremia and hemorrhagic cystitis were not associated with persistent FeLV infection. Another unexpected finding was that most pathogenic infectious agents demonstrated in the cats were not FeLV-associated either. Thus, immunosuppression due to FeLV infection seems to make the animals susceptible to certain pathogenic infectious agents, but not to the majority.",1
We report that 75% of conventionally housed 3- to 4-week-old swine already have detectable activated alveolar macrophages as measured by cytotoxicity of tumor cells. These macrophages can not be further activated by the biological response modifier N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine-2H2O (MDP). These macrophages lose cytotoxic activity when cultured for 24 h and this loss of activity can not be reversed by MDP. We suggest that MDP biological response modifier therapy of swine alveolar macrophages may not be a useful technique in preventing respiratory disease in swine.,1
"The effect of recombinant human interferon-alpha (rHuIFN-α) in vitro and in vivo on mitogen-induced lymphocyte blastogenesis was evaluated in specific-pathogen-free cats. Pre-incubation of isolated feline peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) in vitro with either 104 or 103 International Units (U) of rHuIFN-α for 24 h significantly suppressed (P<0.001 and 0.01, respectively) blastogenic responses to the phytomitogens concanavalin A (Con A) and pokeweed mitogen (PWM). Lower doses of IFN (range, 10–10−3 U/ml) neither suppressed nor enhanced mitogenesis. In the absence of phytomitogens, incubation of PBL with 104–102 U (P<0.001) or 10 U (P<0.05) of rHuIFN-α/ml resulted in a significant decrease in incorporation of [methyl-3H] thymidine into newly synthesized cellular DNA. Cultures of PBL exposed continuously for 4 days to rHuIFN-α doses of 104 U/ml or less did not demonstrate specific reductions in cell viability, indicating that the observed antiproliferative actions of IFN apparently were independent of any direct cytotoxic effects. To investigate the dose-response effects of rHuIFN-α in vivo on lymphocyte blastogenesis, individual groups of cats were evaluated on 3 consecutive days before and then 24 h after each cat was inoculated intramuscularly with either a high dose (106 U/kg), moderate dose (104 U/kg), or a relatively low dose (102 U/kg) of rHuIFN-α. Cats inoculated with 106 U ofrHuIFN-α/kg had significantly reduced (P=0.037) blastogenic responses to Con a at 24 h postinoculation compared to preinoculation values; mean PWM responses were also decreased, but this effect was not statistically significant. In contrast, inoculation of cats with either 104 or 102 U of rHuIFN-α/kg significantly enhanced (P=0.05 or 0.008, respectively) Con A-induced blastogenesis and had no discernible effect on PWM responses. These findings suggest that very high doses of rHuIFN-α given parenterally may be associated with suppression of certain T-cell responses in cats; conversely, much lower doses may be immunoenhancing.",1
"The effect of recombinant porcine interferon-gamma (rPoIFNγ) on in vitro production of interleukin 1 (IL-1) by porcine blood monocytes was studied. Three-day-old cultures of porcine adherent blood mononuclear cells were treated by doses of rPoIFNγ for 3 or 6 days before lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induction. While rPoIFNγ alone had no effect, a combined treatment by rPoIFNγ and LPS enhanced the IL-1 secretory potential of adherent mononuclear cells and, to a lesser extent, the level of cell-associated IL-1. The IL-1 activity was neutralized by anti porcine IL-1 α and β antisera. These results demonstrate that rPoIFNγ has immunomodulatory effects in vitro on porcine monokine production.",1
"Bovine-murine heteromyeloma cell lines were prepared by fusing lymphoid cells from a bovine leukemia virus (BLV)-infected cow with mouse myeloma cells. Selection of hybrid cell colonies was based on the ratio of bovine and murine chromosomes, the presence of cell-surface immunoglobulins and growth characteristics. First-generation fusion partners were compared for fusion efficiency and the number of antigen-specific antibody-producing clones generated. Hybrid cell colonies that initially secreted antibodies were selected from first-generation heteromyelomas to function as second-generation fusion partners. Although fusion efficiencies for both generations did not differ, the second-generation heteromyelomas yielded a higher number of specific antibody-producing clones. Fusion of heteromyelomas with either lymph node cells or splenocytes indicated that fusion with lymph node cells results in a higher number of specific antibody-producing clones, whereas fusion efficiency was found to be higher with splenocytes. The optimal time intervals between the final booster injection and fusion were found to be 4 days for splenocytes and 7 days for lymph node cells. Finally, the characterization of bovine monoclonal antibodies against bovine rotavirus and pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin and their neutralizing capacities in vitro are described.",1
"Intraepithelial leukocytes (IEL) and splenocytes collected from uninfected and rotavirus-infected chickens were evaluated for cytotoxic activity against a natural killer (NK) cell-susceptible lymphoblastoid cell line (LSCC-RP9) and against rotavirus-infected chick kidney cells in 4-h chromium-release assays. Both splenocytes and IELs from uninfected and rotavirus-infected chickens were cytotoxic for LSCC-RP9, and the levels of this NK cell activity were not altered by infection of the host with rotavirus. IELs but not splenocytes from uninfected and rotavirus-infected chickens were cytotoxic for rotavirus-infected but not for uninfected chick kidney cell targets. Because this cytotoxic activity was not induced nor altered by rotavirus infection of the host, and was not major histocompatibility complex-restricted, it was considered to be due to NK cell activity. The cytotoxicity of IELs against rotavirus-infected target cells was dose-dependent; however, there was some suppression of cytotoxic activity at high effector to target cell ratios. There were no differences in the cytotoxic activities of IELs collected from the duodenum versus the jejunum. The in vitro cytotoxic activity of IELs against rotavirus-infected target cells suggested that NK cell activity may be an important immune response to rotavirus infections in vivo. The absence of cytotoxic activity by splenocytes against rotavirus-infected target cells indicated that there may be different subpopulations of NK cells in the spleen and intestinal epithelium of chickens.",1
"Piglets of eight sows vaccinated by different routes with the attenuated TGE mutant coronavirus, Nouzilly (N) strain, and piglets from two field seropositive sows were challenged with a virulent TGE strain. On the day of challenge and 10 days after challenge, milk and serum samples from sows were analysed for their level of neutralizing antibodies, total immunoglobulin classes and TGE antibody classes by an ELISA. No direct relationship was seen between the level of protection of the litters and the titres of the different antibody classes on the day of challenge. However, an inverse correlation was seen 10 days after challenge between protection and the level of TGE antibodies.",1
"Allogeneic PM/86 melanoma cells of Munich Troll® miniature swine have been used for the demonstration of porcine peripheral blood NK cell activity. Compared with the specific lysis of xenogeneic K562-, U937- and Vero-target cells, NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity (NK-CMC) against PM/86 melanoma tumor cells was significantly lower in a 16 h chromium release assay. The target cell susceptibility to pheriperal blood NK-CMC of both adult Troll® miniature swine and German Landrace sows was very similar. Cold target inhibition assays revealed the allogeneic PM/86 melanoma cells to be the most powerful inhibitors of NK-CMC. Nylon wool non-adherent lymphocytes produced interferon (IFN)-alpha in different quantities upon contact with NK susceptible target cells. The NK effector cells could lytic activity against all susceptible targets by a moderate dose of natural human inteleukin-2 (nhuIL-2). The role of NK-CMC in melanoma tumor rejection and/or prevention of metastases is yet unknown in swine although porcine melanoma serves as a good model for the disease in man.",1
"Lack of genetic variability and apparent susceptibility of cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) to coronavirus infection has lead to speculation that this species may have immune system deficits. To establish a foundation for evaluation of the immune function, cheetah peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) were stimulated by a panel of six mitogens, and responses compared with those of domestic cat PBM. Individual responses in both species were variable, but evenly distributed throughout the range of stimulation for each mitogen. Proliferation by PBM from domestic cats occured within the same range as that of the cheetahs. However, a significantly lower response to peanut agglutinin (PNA) was observed with domestic cat PBM. Although responses varied between animals, certain individual cheetahs were consistent responders. The decreased values could not be explained by lack of IL-2 responsiveness since exogenous IL-2 significantly enhanced mitogen-stimulated proliferation in 11 of 12 cheetahs tested. The phenotypic distribution of domestic cat and cheetah lymphocyte subpopulations was similar as assessed by immunofluorescence staining for surface immunoglobulin (sIg) and cytotoxic T (Tc) cells (using a specific monoclonal antibody, FT2). Values for B cells (31.2% sIg+) and Tc (28.7% FT2 +) were slightly higher in domestic cats as compared with cheetah PBM (13.3% sIg+; 19.0% FT2+). Even though no species-specific deficits were detected, a significant negative correlation between PHA-stimulated proliferation and percent FT2+ (Tc) cheetah cells was observed. This indicates that proliferation can be used indirectly to assess relative numbers of functional T helper cells in cheetahs. Our studies suggest that these aspects of the cheetah's immune system are comparable with the domestic cat, and establish a basis for in vitro assays evaluating antigen-specific responses.",1
"Swine leukocyte antigens (SLA) and a macrophage specific marker were monitored on porcine macrophages cultured with or without macrophage colony stimulatory factor (M-CSF) and on cells infected with African swine fever virus (ASFV). SLA expression was maximal either in the total cell extract or on the cell surface at 3–4 days of culture; after 4 days these values began to decrease. Fluorescence analyses of immunostained macrophages cultured with or without M-CSF indicated a major upward shift in the number of SLA Class I molecules on individual macrophages whereas for SLA Class II both a novel expression of Class II and an upward shift in the number of molecules per cell were evident. Infection of 3-day-old macrophage cultures with three different isolates of ASFV resulted in minor changes in surface expression of SLA Class I, SLA Class II, and macrophage markers. No differences in infection with ASFV was observed whether macrophages were SLA Class II positive or negative, nor was there blocking by anti-SLA Class I or Class II monoclonal antibodies of ASFV infection of cultured macrophages.",1
"Rotavirus-naive and rotavirus-immune gnotobiotic calves were treated with high doses of dexamethasone (DX) to suppress the immune system. Calves were then infected with a virulent rotavirus inoculum, J-160, to investigate the role of immune responses both in recovery from primary rotavirus infection and in resistance to secondary rotavirus infection. Treatment of calves with DX markedly suppressed in vitro responsiveness of peripheral blood lymphocytes to mitogens within 48 h of the start of DX treatment. Suppression was similar in rotavirus-naive and rotavirus-immune calves. In contrast, the effect of DX treatment on specific antibody responses differed depending on when DX treatment started in relation to rotavirus infection. When DX treatment commenced prior to primary rotavirus infection both systemic and local specific antibody responses were inhibited. These calves, in which mitogen and antibody responses were suppressed, exhibited greater clinical signs than did control calves after infection with virulent rotavirus, but virus excretion was affected in only one of the two calves. When DX treatment was started after primary rotavirus infection but before secondary infection, systemic and local antibody responses to the primary infection and to the challenge infection were not affected. These calves resisted challenge with virulent virus as did DX-untreated rotavirus-immune calves, even though mitogen responses were suppressed. We conclude that in a primary rotavirus infection, virus excretion ceased when both antibody and mitogen responses were suppressed. Resistance to secondary rotavirus infection occurred when mitogen responsiveness was suppressed, but when antibody levels were normal. Thus, no evidence was obtained that fully functional cell-mediated immune mechanisms are essential for resistance to rotavirus infection. Evidence was provided for the ability of parenteral treatment with DX to suppress mucosal as well as systemic antibody responses.",1
"A study is described of the clinical and pathological findings in 20 specific pathogen free cats infected when 1 year old with feline immunodeficiency virus and monitored over 12 months. Cats were divided into two groups (A and B). The clinical and clinicopathological features were studied in Group A. In Group B, at 1, 2, 4, 9 and 12 months post infection two cats were necropsied. Clinically all cats developed generalised lymphadenopathy, six cats were neutropenic and five cats lymphopenic. Three cats became febrile with conjunctivitis and anterior uveitis and one of these cats ultimately developed jaundice. Postmortem examinations confirmed a generalised lymphadenopathy involving peripheral and visceral lymph nodes with concurrent stimulation of splenic white matter and mucosal lymphoid tissue of the digestive tract and conjunctiva. Within the lymph nodes there was a reactive follicular hyperplasia accompanied by a paracortical hyperplasia with an increased paracortical vascularity. Unusual features were the presence of lymphoid follicles in the bone marrow, thymus and parathyroid tissue. In addition, aggregates of lymphoid cells were found within salivary glands, kidneys, sclera and choroid of the eye. One cat developed a lymphosarcoma affecting the liver and kidneys at 36 weeks post infection. The cat with jaundice had a cholangitis with marked biliary epithelial hyperplasia.",1
"Gnotobiotic calves given intramuscular injections of dexamethasone (DM, 0.5 mg kg−1 day−1) showed marked changes in haematological parameters including a neutrophilia and a lymphopaenia. Not only was there a reduction in the numbers of circulating mononuclear cells, but there was also a significant (P<0.01) decrease in the in vitro responsiveness of the remaining circulating peripheral blood lymphocytes to the mitogens, phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), concanavalin A (ConA) and poke-weed mitogen (PWM). Responses to all three mitogens were suppressed to a similar degree. Analysis of the circulating mononuclear cell sub-populations before and during DM treatment demonstrated a selective depletion of B cells; the T lymphocyte sub-population that expresses the gamma/delta form of T cell receptor, are CD2−, CD5+, CD8−, CD4− and constitute a major population in peripheral blood of calves. In vitro studies in gnotobiotic and conventional calves confirmed that DM was highly inhibitory for PHA responses but, in contrast to the in vivo findings, showed little effect of DM on ConA responses. Expression of surface antigens after 72 h in vitro culture in the presence of DM were little affected with the exception of BoCD8 and MHC II, which showed increased and decreased expression, respectively. These observations would suggest that distinct mechanisms are involved in glucocorticosteroid suppression of the responses to these two mitogens.",1
"In vitro T cell function by domestic cats and cheetahs to two common pathogens, feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1) and Cryptococcus neoformans, was assessed. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) were stimulated with two strains of UV-inactivated FHV-1, whole heat-killed organisms or capsular antigen of Cryptococcus neoformans, and proliferative responses measured. As a group, cheetah PBM responded significantly poorer than domestic cat PBM when cultured with FHV-1. However, individual cheetah responses varied widely. Supplementation of cultures with exogenous interleukin 2 (IL-2) significantly increased the level of response of individual cheetahs to both strains of FHV-1. Cheetah sera contained slightly higher neutralizing antibody titers to FHV-1 than did domestic cat sera, suggesting that B cells function adequately in cheetahs. When stimulated with Cryptococcus neoformans, both species had similar incidences of positive proliferative responses. These data demonstrate that cheetahs exhibit heterogeneous responses to specific antigens, similar to domestic cats. However, a lower group response to FHV-1 in cheetahs suggests species differences occur. In addition, level of variability in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-like genes, as determined by Southern blot hybridization, does not appear to correlate with a uniform response in in vitro functional assays. Therefore, additional mechanisms influence the final outcome of the immune response.",1
"Porcine blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were shown to secrete interferon α (IFN-α) after induction by a coronavirus, the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). IFN-α producing cells, referred to as natural interferon α producing (NIP) cells, were detected by an ELISPOT assay using anti-porcine IFN-α monoclonal antibodies. The frequency of NIP cells among blood cells is low, at most 40–110 per 105 PBMC and each NIP cell was found to produce several units of IFN. We have shown that NIP cell frequency and IFN yield per cell gradually increased with the age of the donor animals, from the neonatal period to the adult age, with a significant increase around puberty. Our present results also indicate that NIP cells may be influenced by physiological and genetic factors; thus (1) NIP cell frequency and IFN yield per cell were decreased during lactation; (2) Chinese (Meishan) pigs were found to have higher NIP cell frequency and IFN yield per cell than European (Large White) animals.",1
"An understanding of the immune response to rotavirus is needed to develop effective prophylaxis. There is evidence that cell-mediated responses may be involved and to extend these observations, rotavirus antigen and the three major T cell subsets, BoCD4+, BoCD8+, and BoWC1+ γ/δ lymphocytes were immunostained in tissue sections from calves killed at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 days post inoculation and quantified by image analysis. It was established that in control calves, BoCD4+ lymphocytes were predominantly in the lamina propria, while the majority of BoCD8+ and BoWC1+ γ/δ lymphocytes were in the epithelium. Rotavirus infection was seen throughout the small intestine with the greatest amount of viral antigen detected at 4 days post inoculation in the mid and distal small intestine. Increased numbers of all subsets were detected; small increases in intraepithelial BoCD4+ and BoWC1+ γ/δ T lymphocytes were observed especially in the distal small intestine, while larger increases in BoCD8+ cells were detected in the epithelium and lamina propria of the proximal, mid and distal small intestine. The timing and location of these increases in T lymphocyte subsets is indicative of a specific immune response involving BoCD8+ and BoWC1+ γ/δ T lymphocytes.",1
"In this report, we describe an in vitro culture method for feline bone marrow cells, which yields large numbers of quiescent macrophages after 14 days of culture. The bulk of the cultured cell population consists of macrophages as assessed by morphology, macrophage specific cytochemistry, and phagocytosis. The remaining cells were lymphocytes, bone marrow stromal cells, fibroblasts and occasional polymorphonuclear leukocytes. While resting cells produced no detectable interleukin 1, stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced the production of biologically active interleukin 1. After 6 h LPS stimulation, mRNA for tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin 1β was detectable. The absence of mRNA in unstimulated cells indicates cultured macrophages were not activated until stimulated by LPS or plastic adherence. This approach provides a useful means to measure potential modulatory effects by virus infections or other agents upon feline macrophage gene expression.",1
"In order to evaluate mucosal antibody responses to rotavirus, an enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay was adapted to enumerate antibody-secreting cells (ASC) in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), lamina propria (LP) of the small intestine and spleens of gnotobiotic pigs orally inoculated with porcine rotaviruses (SB1A and Gottfried). Rotavirus-specific IgM ASC occurred by post-inoculation day (PID) 3, and numbers peaked in spleen and MLN tissues by PID 7 and in intestinal LP by PID 7–14. Numbers of rotavirus specific IgA and IgG ASC in these tissues peaked at PID 14–21. Rotavirus specific IgA ASC were predominant in the gut and IgA to IgG rotavirus specific ASC ratios were highest for all rotavirus antigen coatings in the gut LP. However, the relative ratios of specific IgA to IgG ASC were lower (ratios of 5 to 7) against combined structural and nonstructural viral antigens (rotavirus-infected fixed cell ELISPOT plates) than ratios (13 to 46) against only viral structural antigens (rotavirus-coated ELISPOT plates), indicating that there were proportionately more specific IgG ASC to the nonstructural viral antigens in the LP, the tissue adjacent to the site of rotavirus replication in the intestine. In the node cells (spleen and MLN) rotavirus-specific IgA to IgG ASC ratios were lowest and against the various ELISPOT rotavirus coatings ranged from 0.7 to 4. Gnotobiotic piglets inoculated at different ages with porcine rotaviruses generally showed similar specific immunoglobulin (Ig) ASC responses to rotavirus infection, along with similar diarrhea and virus shedding patterns in the different age groups. However, the numbers of specific IgA ASC in the MLN of 3–4 week old pigs were higher than those of 3–5 day old pigs. Although challenge of SB1A or Gottfried rotavirus-inoculated pigs with SB1A (G4P7) or Gottfried (G4P6) rotavirus revealed a high degree of protection from diarrhea and virus shedding, greater numbers of specific IgM ASC were observed in spleen after challenge of SB1A-inoculated pigs with Gottfried rotavirus (same G type, distinct P type). Thus, by using the ELISPOT technique, we successfully measured intestinal mucosal antibody-related responses to rotavirus in gnotobiotic pigs. Moreover, our results support the use of gnotobiotic piglets as an animal model to evaluate active antibody responses and protection against rotavirus infection and disease.",1
"We report the cloning, expression and characterization of biologically active feline tumour necrosis factor-α (fTNF-α). Messenger RNA was extracted from feline peritoneal macrophage cultures and used to synthesize cDNA for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. The PCR products were cloned into the plasmid vector pCRII and sequenced, showing 99.3% homology with a published fTNF-α gene sequence. Subcloning into the vector pGEX-2T and subsequent expression resulted in a 43 kDa fusion protein of fTNF-α and glutathione S-transferase (GST). Thrombin cleavage of the fusion protein yielded a 17 kDa protein. This protein cross-reacted with a monoclonal anti-human TNF-α antibody in Western blotting, but not with a polyclonal anti-murine TNF-α serum. Recombinant fTNF-α (rfTNF-α) and rfTNF-α-GST had a CD50 of 15 ng ml−1 and 230 ng ml−1, respectively, in the L929 cytotoxicity assay. Cats given rfTNF-α-GST intravenously manifested the typical biological effects of TNF-α, including fever, depression, and piloerection. The rfTNF-α-GST upregulated IL-2 receptor and MHC-II antigen expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated in vitro, but had no effect on TNF-α receptor and MHC-I antigen expression.",1
"During a natural outbreak of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), groups of piglets were treated orally for 4 consecutive days with placebo or 1.0, 10.0 or 20.0 international units (IU) natural human interferon alpha (nHuIFNα). Piglets that were 1–12 days of age and given 1.0, 10.0 or 20.0 IU nHuIFNα had significantly (P < 0.01) greater survival rates than placebo-treated piglets; survival rates were the greater for the highest level of nHuIFNα treatment. In contrast, beneficial effects of nHuIFNα were not observed in piglets farrowed during the disease outbreak and given nHuIFNα within hours of birth. Oral nHuIFNα therapy modulates the natural course of high morbidity and mortality commonly seen with TGE.",1
"Calves fed soya proteins may develop severe gastrointestinal disorders. Whether these are predominantly associated with particular Ig subclasses and (or) dietary proteins remains unclear. Therefore, antibody responses to soyabean protein were analysed by dot- and blot-immunobinding in plasma and intestinal mucous secretions. One-month-old calves were fed for 2.5 months liquid diets based on skim milk powder (SMP) or a mixture (2:3, protein basis) of whey and soyabean products including a low antigenic hydrolysed soya protein isolate (HSPI) and a highly antigenic heated soya flour (HSF). Specific antibodies (Abs) of the main isotypes (IgM, IgA, IgG1, IgG2) were characterised by immunostaining of samples which had been previously incubated with nitrocellulose sheets coated with SMP, HSPI or HSF extracts. Plasma collected before feeding experimental diets showed very little specific Abs. By contrast, 2.5 month later, a three-fold increase (P < 0.05) in IgG1 and IgA titres against HSF antigens was observed in calves fed HSF compared with those fed the control or HSPI diet. IgG1 immunoblotting revealed many protein bands from soya in the molecular range of 22–32 and 38–42 kDa. Immunorecognition of specific proteins from SMP and HSPI remained low and similar among animal groups. Specific IgM, IgA and IgG1 titres against HSF, and to a lesser extent HSPI, were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in jejunal mucous secretion of calves fed HSF compared with other groups. Secretions from calves fed HSF bound to many soyabean proteins in the range of 17–23 and 26–38 kDa, with similar patterns for IgA and IgG1. By contrast, only weak bands were found for IgM and IgG2 in all groups of calves. Thus, calves fed antigenic HSF do present specific Abs including IgG1 and IgA isotypes, both systemically and locally. Therefore, IgG1 and (or) IgA rather than IgM and IgG2 Abs may be preferred for assessing the immunogenicity of soyabean products in calves. Interestingly, soyabean immunogenicity was drastically reduced by adequate proteolysis.",1
"Isotype-specific antibody responses to bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV1) were measured in sera, nasal, ocular and genital secretions of calves that were reinfected with BHV1 and 6 weeks later treated with corticosteroids to reactivate putative latent virus. After reinfection and after reactivation, no BHV1-specific IgM antibody response was detected. The serum IgA response was only transiently detectable after reinfection and again appeared rapidly after reactivation in most calves. Most calves showed an increase in nasal and ocular IgA titres after reinfection and reactivation; some calves also had IgA antibodies in genital secretions. A salient finding was that after reinfection and reactivation more calves showed a serum IgA response than virus shedding or an increase in serum IgG1 or IgG2 titres. This suggests that the serum IgA response would be the most sensitive indicator to detect BHV1 reinfection and reactivation. No correlation was found between nasal IgA titre at the time of reinfection or corticosteroid treatment and the period of virus shedding, suggesting that nasal IgA does not play a major role in protection against reinfection with BHV1.",1
"The contribution of cell-mediated immunity to protective immunity against virulent transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection conferred by primary porcine respiratry coronavirus (PRCV) or TGEV exposure was assessed in pigs that were challenged with TGEV 24 days after a primary oronasal inoculation with PRCV or TGEV when 11 days old. PRCV exposure induced partial protection against TGEV challenge in suckling pigs based upon a decreased number of diarrhea cases (42% vs. 90% in age-matched control pigs), limited virus shedding in feces, and increases in virus-neutralizing serum antibody titers; in contrast, all 11-day-old pigs inoculated with TGEV were completely protected after challenge. Weaned pigs were also studied to eliminate any possibility that lactogenic immunity from contact PRCV-exposed sows contributed to protection against TGEV. Once weaned, none of the PRCV-exposed or age-matched control pigs had diarrhea after TGEV challenge; moreover, both groups exhibited less rectal virus shedding than suckling pigs. Vigorous lymphocyte proliferative responses (> 96 000 counts per minute (cpm)) were detected in mononuclear cells prepared from mesenteric (MLN) and bronchial (BLN) lymph nodes of TGEV-primed pigs. Analyses of these responses indicate that virus-specific cell-mediated immune responses correlated with protection against rectal and nasal virus shedding after TGEV challenge. Primary inoculation of 11-day-old pigs with PRCV induced moderate, transient virus-specific lymphocyte proliferation (> 47 000 cpm) in MLN from both suckling and weaned pigs after TGEV challenge. Substantial BLN proliferative responses (> 80 000 cpm) correlated with failure to detect TGEV in nasal secretions from these pigs. Virus-specific lymphocyte proliferation in spleens was delayed in onset and of lower magnitude than that observed in MLN and BLN. Virulent TGEV exposure resulted in increased percentages of T cell subsets, especially in the lamina propria and MLN, mucosaassociated lymphoid tissues in proximity to the primary replication site of TGEV in the small intestine. Our results confirm that PRCV infection primes anti-viral immune responses and, thus, contributes to partial immunity against virulent TGEV challenge.",1
"The efficacy and the long-term protection of a recombinant feline leukemia virus (FeLV) vaccine were determined in 30 specified pathogen free cats for over 3 years. At the same time, in order to specify the effects of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) on the immune system, one half of the cats (n = 15) were previously infected with the Swiss isolate FIV Zurich 2. The second half of the animals (n = 15) served as non-infected controls. Eighteen (nine FIV-negative, nine FIV-positive) vaccinated and 12 (six FIV-negative, six FIV-positive) non-vaccinated cats were intraperitoneally challenged with FeLV A. Seventeen of 18 vaccinated cats were protected against persistent viremia, while ten of 12 non-vaccinated controls became infected. An increase of antibodies against FeLV SU was found in all protected cats after the challenge exposure. No difference in vaccine efficacy was found between FIV-negative and FIV-positive animals. The whole group of cats was observed for over 3 years. There were no further vaccinations during this period. CD4+ and CD8+ cell subsets, clinical outcome and time of survival of the cats were recorded. FIV-negative and FIV-positive animals were kept in two different rooms. However, FeLV-negative and FeLV viremic cats were housed together in both rooms in order to imitate a natural FeLV exposure situation. Anti-recombinant FeLV SU antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Although a continuous decline of antibodies was found in FeLV vaccinated cats, they remained protected against constant FeLV challenge for over 3 years. FIV infection had a stronger effect on the depression of the CD4+:CD8+ ratio than FeLV infection. Within the group of FIV-positive cats, the FeLV-vaccinated animals had significantly better survival rates as well as better clinical and laboratory parameters. FIV- and FeLV-coinfected cats showed the lowest CD4+:CD8+ ratio, mainly caused by decreased CD4+ lymphocyte counts. CD8+ lymphocytes with strong fluorescence (CD8high) disappeared and cells with weak fluorescence (CD8low) appeared instead. Prevention of coinfection by immunizing FIV-positive cats against FeLV infection improved the clinical outcome and prolonged the cat's life expectancy.",1
"Genetic variation in total and differential white blood cell (WBC) counts, phagocytic capacity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL), virus induced interferon-α (IFN-α) production, mitogen induced proliferation and interleukin 2 (IL-2) production of mononuclear cells (MNC) in vitro was studied in blood collected from 124 Yorkshire piglets, aged 8 weeks. The piglets were the offspring from 12 sires and 31 dams. Data from an earlier experiment, including 96 piglets of seven sires and 24 dams, were added when estimating heritabilities for Con A induced proliferation and IL-2 production. The highest heritability (h 2=0.87±0.41) was estimated for the total number of PMNL. Medium high heritabilities (h 2=0.3−0.4) were estimated for the phagocytic capacity of PMNL, Con A induced proliferation and IL-2 production and the total number of WBC, while the heritability estimates were lower (h 2=0.00−0.08±0.12) for the total number of lymphocytes, serum concentrations of Ig and IFN-α production. Pronounced differences between litters from various dams were found for total number of lymphocytes, IFN-α production, Con A induced proliferation and IL-2 production. The Con A induced proliferation was positively correlated (r=0.48, P<0.001) with the IL-2 production and both these parameters were correlated (r=0.44 and 0.37, respectively, P<0.001) to the virus induced IFN-α production. Despite these positive correlations, no parental offspring group was uniformly superior across all traits measured. However, the heritabilities estimated for the immune parameters are sufficiently high to be used as genetic markers in selection for general immune competence of swine.",1
"Four hundred and thirty-nine feline serum samples from cats with different living conditions in the north of Italy were tested for antibodies to feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and for antigen of Feline Leukemia Virus by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A Western blot technique was also used on the positive sera in order to confirm the presence of specific antibodies to FIV. The Western blot enabled the detection of a false positive serum. The prevalence of FIV infection in this population was 12.5% and among the seropositive cats a greater proportion was male (74.5%) than female (25.5%). A correlation between the clinical status and the evolution of the pathology is described together with a score based on the severity of the stomatitis in infected cats. The Western blot patterns of positive samples were then compared with the stage of the pathology. Statistical analysis on the distribution of FIV in stray cats, cats with garden and courtyard access and strictly house-confined cats showed a highly significant risk of the infection in the first group.",1
"Field studies have suggested that ‘stressors’, such as transportation and mixing, might interfere with the immune competence of pigs. Therefore, an experimental model was established to study the influence of elevated concentrations of circulating cortisol on the immune capacity in swine. Three experimental groups, with six pigs in each, were immunized twice, 4 weeks apart, with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae antigen. Endogenous production of cortisol was induced by intramuscular injection of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) twice daily. One group received ACTH during the week before and after the second immunization, one group during the week after the second immunization only, while one group served as untreated controls. The treatment with ACTH induced high, but physiological, concentrations of cortisol in plasma. Simultaneously, the number of lymphocytes per milliliter blood decreased while the neutrophil number increased. The elevated concentrations of cortisol also coincided with reduced proliferation and interleukin-2 production by blood lymphocytes stimulated with the mitogens concanavalin A and phytohemagglutinin in vitro, while the responses to pokeweed mitogen were less affected. The suppression of mitogen responses was more pronounced in cultures of whole blood than in cultures of purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Antibody production, induced by M. hyopneumoniae in cultures of purified PBMC was also inhibited by ACTH treatment. Both the rate of increase and the magnitude of the antibody production induced by the primary immunization were reduced. In contrast, no effects of ACTH treatment were recorded for the response to the second immunization or on the serum levels of antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae. The ability of blood leukocytes to produce interferon-α (IFN-α) at exposure in vitro to fixed pseudorabies virus adsorbed to porcine kidney cells increased in all animals shortly after the second immunization with M. hyopneumoniae. The influence of cortisol on the IFN-α-producing capacity was dependent on whether the test was carried out in whole blood cultures or in cultures with purified PBMC. This finding further emphasizes that the relevance of in vitro assays for measuring in vivo phenomena must be carefully scrutinized.",1
"In vitro culture conditions were determined to induce an anti-Salmonella abortusovis antibody synthesis from lymph node leucocytes of three immunized sheep and two unprimed lambs maintained in culture in the presence of heat-inactivated bacteria for 2 weeks. Humoral immune responses were assessed by enumerating specific antibody-secreting cells using ELISASPOT and by titrating immunoglobulins secreted into culture supernatants using ELISA techniques. Optimal secondary antibody response was observed from cultures performed with fetal calf serum (compared with horse serum) and with an antigen concentration of one to ten bacteria per cell. This kind of antigenic stimulation allowed induction of numerous antibody-secreting cells without adsorption of the secreted antibodies. Maximal numbers of antibody-secreting cells could reach a rate of 1% of the sheep leucocytes initially put into culture. Kinetic profiles of antibody production from boosted lymph node cells were characterized by an ascending phase from the sixth to the twelfth day of culture and then showed a plateau phase until Day 14. Most of the responses were composed of IgM and IgG1 antibodies, traces of IgG2 being detected at the end of experiments. From the twelfth day of antigenic stimulation, the IgM isotype was preferentially expressed with high antigen concentration (100 bacteria per cell), whereas the highest amounts of IgG1 were detected at lower concentration (one to ten bacteria per cell). While anti-Salmonella IgM appeared to be mainly specific for the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) cell wall fraction, some IgG1 recognized other bacterial antigens. Kinetic profiles and magnitudes of primary antibody responses induced in vitro from lamb lymph node cells did not differ from those defined in cultures of sheep boosted leucocytes. But these immune reactions were mainly made up of anti-LPS IgM. Few anti-Salmonella IgG1 were detected from the tenth day of culture. So these in vitro assays allowed induction of an antibody synthesis from either in vivo sensitized or unprimed sheep lymph node leucocytes. This methodology would permit achievement of more detailed studies on interactions between Salmonella and lymph node leucocytes, leading to a better understanding of the mechanisms controlling bacterial dissemination through the lymphoid tissue.",1
"Despite the pioneering efforts to identify correlates of passive immunity to transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), effective vaccines for the control of TGE in suckling pigs have remained elusive. The initial concept of an enteromammary immunologic axis in monogastrics originated from studies of lactogenic immunity to TGEV in swine. These studies revealed that infection of pregnant swine with virulent TGEV stimulated high titers of SIgA antibodies in milk which correlated with protection of suckling pigs against TGE; parenteral or oral inoculation with live attenuated or killed TGEV vaccines induced mainly IgG antibodies in milk which generally provided poor protection to suckling pigs. The recent appearance of PRCV infections in swine and continuing studies of TGEV infections, present a unique model for further studies of mucosal immunity. Research using these viruses has increased our understanding of the various components of the common mucosal immune system and their interactions. Although the most important consideration in designing an effective vaccine for TGEV is the stimulation of GALT through intestinal virus replication, studies addressing the contribution of BALT to immunity to TGEV and PRCV may provide insights for alternative vaccine approaches. The mechanism by which exposure to PRCV elicits a variable degree of immunity to TGEV challenge is unknown. Virus replication in the gut or respiratory tract is a major factor affecting the magnitude of the immune response at the respective site and may be necessary for the recruitment of specific immune cells from other mucosal inductive sites, i.e., GALT to BALT and BALT to GALT migration. Further studies on the induction and immune regulation of specific responses to TGEV and PRCV that affect the distribution patterns of IgM-, IgG- and IgA-antibody-secreting cells (ASC) and T lymphocytes should provide valuable insights for optimizing vaccine regimens to elicit the highest mucosal immune responses and optimal protection against TGEV challenge.",1
"Greyhound kennel owners frequently employ multiple vaccination schedules in an attempt to reduce financial losses incurred as a result of infectious diseases. In order to determine the effects of multiple vaccination schedules on the immune system of racing greyhounds, three litters of greyhound pups raised in laboratory conditions were divided into two groups and subjected to either a maximum or a minimum vaccination schedule. Blood samples were collected biweekly for 6 months beginning at 2 weeks of age and analyzed to establish ‘baseline’ values for the lymphatic system of greyhounds. Lymphocyte transformation, total and differential leukocyte counts, and flow cytometry were used to evaluate cellular immunity. Humoral immunity was evaluated using serum neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition tests. Proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes in response to the mitogen concanavalin A (Con A) was higher for the maximum vaccination groups. The frequency distribution of circulating CD4 and IgG labeled lymphocytes was higher in the minimum vaccination groups. A significant treatment by time interaction in CD4, IgG, and IgM labeled cells was observed. This interaction, however, was not significant at any point in time for CD4 and IgG labeled cells. The percentage of lymphocytes expressing surface IgM was significantly higher in the minimum vaccination groups at 10 and 14 weeks of age. No significant differences were detected in humoral immunity between the maximum and minimum groups of each litter. Results of this study indicate that maximum vaccination schedules do not appear to be more effective or more immunosuppressive than minimum vaccination schedules.",1
"Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus antigen was demonstrated after methanol, ethanol or formalin fixation in paraffin-embedded tissues by means of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. The monoclonal antibody was induced by immunization with transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Polyclonal antibodies were obtained by purification on protein A-Sepharose of ascites fluid from a cat with FIP. Almost all cats diagnosed as suffering from FIP by postmortem and histological examination exhibited FIP virus (FIPV) antigen in macrophages in granulomas whereas FIPV antigen was only once demonstrable in another location.",1
"The early stages of the host response to infectious agents include a number of physiologic changes, collectively known as the acute phase response. The acute phase response is comprised of reactions localized at the site of infection, as well as the initiation of systemic responses, which include a rapid increase in the serum concentration of some proteins, known as acute phase proteins (APP). Using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we detected two APP of approximately 22 and 37 kDa molecular weight in sera obtained from cattle with bovine respiratory disease (BRD). Based on their presence in the sera of sick, but not normal animals, the molecular weights, N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis, and the ability to bind hemoglobin, we identified these proteins as the α and β subunits of haptoglobin. The haptoglobin molecule and the α subunit were isolated from serum, purified, and used to produce monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. With these reagents, an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was developed to measure the concentration of haptoglobin in bovine serum. Using an experimental model of BRD induced by a sequential challenge of calves with bovine herpesvirus type-1 and Pasteurella haemolytica, we observed a temporal relationship between the increase in haptoglobin concentration in serum and the onset of bacterial infection. The haptoglobin concentration ranged from undetectable in the serum of most calves prior to challenge, to greater than 1 mgml−1 in over one-third of the calves at the height of disease. Furthermore, the concentration of haptoglobin was associated significantly with other measures of the severity of disease. Together, these results indicate that quantification of acute phase proteins in animals with BRD could be a valuable diagnostic and prognostic aid.",1
"Ileal intraepithelial and lamina propria lymphocytes from newborn, 1.5-week-old, and 3-week-old calves were compared to determine to what extent the mucosa becomes populated after birth. Single and dual fluorescence flow cytometry were used with monoclonal antibodies to bovine (Bo) CD molecules to identify lymphocyte subpopulations. Few ileal mucosal lymphocytes were present in calves at birth. However, by 1.5 weeks of age, the villi were populated with large numbers of lymphocytes, and by 3 weeks of age, the numbers had increased further. These included a prominent subpopulation of γδT cells. Several subsets of γδT cells populated ileal mucosa after birth. The predominant subset coexpressed BoCD2, and a smaller subset coexpressed BoCD8. WC1+ γδT cells comprised the smallest subset. All γδT cell subsets coexpressed ACT2, a molecule expressed on activated WC1+ and WC1− γδT cells from cattle.",1
"Bone-marrow (BM) derived macrophages are sensitive target cells for replication of mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV3). These cells can be grown in large numbers and the percentage of defined macrophages increased until day 10 when 100% of the cells represented macrophages. MHV3 replicated within these cells to high titers and caused the formation of multi-nucleated giant cells. This effect was seen with very low virus inocula in BM macrophages of C57BL/6 mice that are highly susceptible to in vivo infection with MHV3 whereas macrophages from resistant A/J mice did not show a cytopathic effect at these virus doses. 1000-fold higher virus doses, however, caused the cytopathic effect in macrophages of both C57BL/6 and A/J mice.",1
"Macrophages are thought to constitute an important element in the body's natural defense against invasion and dissemination of viruses. Possible antiviral mechanisms of macrophages are defined and referred to as intrinsic, i.e. the ability of macrophages to serve as a non-permissive barrier between the virus and susceptible cells and extrinsic, i.e. the ability of macrophages to affect the virus or virus replication in surrounding cells. Most studies on the role of macrophages in natural resistance to virus infections have been performed in animal models. An interesting aspect of many viral infections in animals is the finding of a genetically determined variation in natural resistance. Because of the availability of numerous inbred and congenic strains most studies on genetically determined resistance have been performed in mice. The classical examples are resistance to flaviviruses and susceptibility to mouse hepatitis virus, both of which are inherited as dominant, monogenic traits. With these viruses macrophage intrinsic restriction of virus replication has been found to express at the cellular level the genetics of resistance/susceptibility seen in the intact animal. Other examples, where macrophages have been implicated in genetically determined resistance include herpes simplex virus and influenza virus. The involvement of macrophages in natural resistance to these viruses is discussed in relation to other putative resistance determinants like interferon production and sensitivity and natural killer cell activity.",1
"We have previously demonstrated the expression of aminopeptidase N (APN, CD13) on synovial T cells from patients with different forms of arthritis. T cells of peripheral blood and serous body fluids are CD13-negative but can be stimulated to express CD13 after activation, e.g., with Con A. In the present report, double-labelling and flow cytometry analyses were performed to characterize the phenotype of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). A large panel of antibodies specific for different activation-associated molecules on T cells was used. In contrast to TIL of lung cancer, TIL of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) consisted of significantly higher percentages of T cells expressing CD13, dipeptidylpeptidase N (DPIV, CD26) and HLA-DR, whereas T cells of lung cancer expressed more CD25, CD69 and CD54/ICAM1. No differences could be found in the expression of CD45RO, CD49a/VLA-1 and CD62L/L-selectin. Our results demonstrate that T cells in RCC and lung cancer differ in their phenotype, especially with respect to surface aminopeptidases. Investigations into the function of APN on T cells could be of help in gaining deeper insight into tumour defence as well as into general mechanisms of T cell functions.",1
"We examined the ontogeny of IFN-α Secreting Cells (IFN-α SC) in different hematopoietic organs and blood of porcine fetuses at different stages of gestation. Cells were induced to produce IFN-α by incubation with the coronavirus TGEV and IFN-α SC were detected by ELISPOT. A striking finding was that IFN-α SC could be detected in the fetal liver as early as at 26 days of gestation, i.e., during the first quarter of gestation, a period at which T-cell markers could not be detected by flow cytometry. In addition, IFN-α SC could be detected in the cord blood, the spleen and the bone marrow of fetuses at later stages of gestation. These data indicate that IFN-α SC appear very early during the ontogeny of the immune system, long before the development of the specific immune system, and may therefore represent an early antiviral defence mechanism. IFN-α SC were found to be associated with hematopoietic organs, which argues for their hematopoietic lineage.",1
"Reactive changes of microglia in response to neuronal degeneration were investigated in the brains of brindled mottled mice with immunocytochemical technique. This mutant has a genetic defect in copper metabolism and spontaneous neuronal degeneration develops around postnatal day 10, in particular in the parasagittal regions of the cerebral cortex and thalamus. The antibodies to macrophage specific antigen, F4/80 and to type-three complement receptor, Mac-1 were used for the study. Reactive morphological changes of microglia, which are immuno-reactive to the antibodies to F4/80 and/or Mac-1, were demonstrated in areas corresponding to those of neuronal degeneration, coincident with the emergence of cells expressing major histocompatibility complex class II, Ia, antigen. Some of the Ia expressing cells had morphological features of ramified microglia, while others were rod shaped with few processes and were mostly located in the perivascular regions. The focal nature of such cellular changes suggests that signal(s) from the degenerating neurons may be responsible for microglial activation and cellular expression of the Ia antigen in the brain of the brindled mouse.",1
"The tumor phenotype is associated with the rearrangement of genetic information and the altered expression of many gene products. In this review, genes associated with the tumor phenotype have been arranged on the human gene map and indicate the extent to which the tumor phenotype involves the human genome. Nonrandom chromosomal aberrations that are frequently observed in tumors are presented. Altered metabolic demands of the tumor cell are reflected in altered gene expressions of a wide range of enzymes and other proteins, and these changed enzyme patterns are described. The study of oncogenes increasingly suggests that they may be significant in certain cancers, and the assignment of these genes has been tabulated. The biochemical and metabolic changes observed in tumors are complex; studying the patterns and interactions of these changes will aid our genetic understanding of the origins and development of tumors.",1
"Temperature-sensitive mutants of the murine coronavirus JHM induced a subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (SDE) in young rats. Neurological symptoms were associated with marked lesions of primary demyelination in the white matter of the central nervous system (CNS), and developing after an incubation time of several weeks to months. Many rats survived this infection and recovered completely from this CNS disease. Among 43 survivors of SDE, 9 rats developed a relapse 27–153 days after onset of the first attack. Neuropathological examination of these animals revealed areas of fresh demyelination together with old remyelinated lesions. Viral antigens were detectable in the neighbourhood of fresh lesions and in some cases infectious virus was re-isolated from rats revealing low antibody titers to JHM virus. These results demonstrate that mutants of JHM virus can induce a relapsing demyelinating disease process, associated with a persistent infection, which possesses some similarities to chronic experimental allergic encephalomyelitis.",1
"The humoral intrathecal immune response in coronavirus-induced demyelinating encephalomyelitis in rats associated with an autoimmune reaction to brain antigen, was analysed. The CSF of these animals revealed immune reactions which were directed against coronavirus and other, unknown, antigens. In general, no direct correlation between the disease, the state of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), intrathecal synthesis of Ig and the presence of virus-specific antibodies was detectable, suggesting that the humoral, in contrast to the cellular, immune response does not play a significant pathogenetic role in this CNS disease.",1
"Albumin and IgG were quantitated in paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples from dogs with demyelinating canine distemper virus (CDV) infection by means of rocket immunoelectrophoresis. The IgG index as indicator for intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis was normal in animals with non-inflammatory demyelinating lesions and elevated in dogs with inflammatory myelin lesions. Specific antibodies against CDV and myelin were quantitated in CSF and serum from 8 dogs with an elevated IgG index. Eight of these dogs had significant amounts of antimyelin antibody and 4 dogs had neutralizing anti-CDV antibody in the CSF. Whereas the pathogenetic significance of antimyelin antibodies remains uncertain, the intrathecal antiviral immune response provides a plausible explanation for immunopathologic destruction of myelin in distemper.",1
"The expression of autoantigens on murine cortical brain cells and their first appearance during development was studied. Autoreactivity was analyzed by weight increase and lymphocyte proliferation in the popliteal lymph node (PLN). Cortical brain cells or defined plasma membrane preparations were injected s.c. without adjuvant into syngeneic recipients. Weak, but significant T cell-dependent PLN enlargement was triggered with brain cells from adult mice. A stronger reaction could be elicited with one defined fraction of purified plasma membranes. The earliest appearance of the antigenic material in the plasma membrane fraction was observed on day 15 after birth. This time point correlates exactly with the completion of the blood-brain barrier in large parts of the central nervous system.",1
"Serum and CSF specimens from clinically healthy Brown Norway (BN) rats inoculated intracerebrally with corona virus JHM were analysed with respect to the state of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the intrathecal synthesis and isoelectric distribution of immunoglobulins (Ig). Increased CSF/serum ratios for Ig in the context of an intact BBB were never seen in the absence of intrathecal synthesis of virus-specific antibodies. Affinity-mediated immunoblot analysis revealed a broad pattern of virus-specific antibodies with embedded clusters of restricted heterogeneity, but no signs of oligoclonal Ig production carrying non-viral specificity. From these data it was concluded that BN rats do control the intracerebral spread of JHM virus effectively by a strong local virus-specific antibody response, thereby preventing a clinically apparent disease.",1
"Viral particles of a neurotropic murine hepatitis virus (JHM) and various substances known to have immunoregulatory effects, including bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and synthetic adjuvant peptide (muramyl dipeptide) (AP), were tested for their ability to induce Ia antigen expression on Lewis rat astrocytes in vitro. JHM virus, LPS and AP are all capable of inducing Ia molecules on astrocytes, however, in a pattern and kinetics distinct from recombinant rat gamma interferon (γ-IFN). Whereas γ-IFN induced Ia expression on astrocytes and all macrophages after 48 h treatment, JHM virus, LPS and AP required 4–7 days for maximal induction of Ia on astrocytes, but had little to no effect on the macrophage population. This indicates that astrocytes are uniquely reactive to components derived from infectious agents and that these components are immunoregulatory with respect to Ia expression on astrocytes. We have also attempted to determine possible mechanisms by which these agents induce astrocyte Ia and show that phorbol myristate acetate and Ca2+ ionophore A23187 have similar effects. These findings suggest that infectious agents may directly stimulate antigen presenting functions of astrocytes in the brain through γ-IFN-independent mechanisms.",1
"Measles virus induced a marked increase in the expression of MHC-coded class I and class II antigens as detected by immunostaining during both fatal and non-fatal brain infections in rats. The distribution of these molecules in the brain was much more widespread than the occurence of viral antigen suggesting a soluble factor for their induction. In 14-day-old rats with a non-fatal infection there was a marked infiltration of T lymphocytes of ‘cytotoxic/suppressor’ phenotype in the brain parenchyma, whereas T ‘helper’ cell phenotypes mainly were located perivascularly. In brains from newborn rats with a fatal infection no or only few lymphocytes were detected.",1
Myelin basic protein (MBP) appears frequently in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of mice with chronic demyelination following intracerebral infection with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV); antibody to MBP can frequently be found in the sera. The peaks of the immune responses to both MBP and TMEV coincide with the time course of the clinical signs of disease. Adsorption of mouse sera with TMEV or MBP indicate the non-identity of the antigens and the specificity of the antisera as measured by ELISA. Immunoblot analysis of sera confirmed the ELISA findings. The mechanism of induction of antibody directed against MBP and its role in TMEV-associated demyelination remain to be determined.,1
"Macrophage-microglia were isolated from primary mixed brain cell cultures of normal newborn mice. They were successfully maintained in vitro for at least 8 weeks. Purity of the cultures was 97–100%, as determined by endocytosis of latex beads, non-specific staining through Fc receptors, EA and EAC rosette formation. These cells were non-specific esterase-positive, but peroxidase-negative. Electron-microscope observations revealed morphological similarities to mature macrophages. Isolated macrophage-microglia seldom incorporated [3H]thymidine in vitro. By means of 51Cr release assay, using monoclonal antibodies against mouse major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens and complement, we detected class I MHC (H-2) antigen on unstimulated macrophage-microglia, and both class I and class II (Ia) antigens on γ-interferon-treated cells. These observations suggest possible immunoregulatory functions of macrophage-microglia in the central nervous system, as is characteristics of other cells of monocyte lineage.",1
"The JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) elicits an I-A-restricted delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response mediated by a Thy-1+, Lyt-1+, and CD4+ T cell. Adoptive transfer of these polyclonal CD4+ T cells from immunized mice prevents death in lethally infected recipients without significantly reducing virus titer in the central nervous system (CNS). These observations raise the possibility that the recruitment of mononuclear cells into the CNS may play a critical role in survival from a lethal CNS infection. Transient DTH response to nonviral antigens induced an accumulation of monocytes in the CNS that was maximal at 48 h post-challenge and virtually resolved by 5 days post-challenge. By contrast the induction of prolonged DTH responses resulted in the accumulation of a large number monocytes that persisted in the CNS for at least 5 days post-challenge. Neither type of DTH reaction suppressed virus replication or prevented death from concomitant lethal JHMV infection.",1
"The intrathecal humoral immune response was analysed in patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) and Lewis rats with subacute measles virus (MV)-induced encephalomyelitis (SAME). SSPE patients as well as SAME rats revealed oligoclonal, intrathecal antibody synthesis with MV specificity. SAME rats synthesized MV-specific antibodies intracerebrally to a higher extent than SSPE patients. Although a restricted isoelectric pattern of MV-specific antibodies was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of SSPE patients as well as of SAME rats, the heterogeneity within clusters of immunoglobulin bands was higher in the rat specimens. Increase in the blood-brain barrier permeability for albumin was exclusively detected in SAME rats but not in SSPE patients. These data suggest that the rat model offers excellent opportunities to study the initial humoral events in MV-induced encephalitides.",1
Intracerebral inoculation of weanling Lewis rats with measles virus led to the development of subacute measles encephalomyelitis (SAME) 4–8 weeks after infection. The disease is characterized pathologically by an intense inflammatory infiltration within both the white and grey matter of the central nervous system (CNS) without apparent demyelination. Both during and after SAME splenic lymphocytes from these animals could be restimulated in vitro to proliferate in the presence of myelin basic protein (MBP). MBP-specific class II MHC-restricted T cell lines were isolated from this cell population. They were shown to exhibit no cross-reactivity with measles virus and to induce experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE) in naive syngeneic recipients following adoptive transfer. The clinical and histopathological signs of this T cell-mediated disease were identical to that seen in classical T cell-mediated EAE. A humoral immune response to MBP was only detected in a limited number of those rats with SAME. These results indicate that autoimmune reactions to brain antigen can arise during measles virus infection which may contribute to the pathogenesis of measles virus-associated encephalomyelitis.,1
"To help clarify effector mechanisms in experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE), the cytotoxic effects of myelin basic protein (MBP)-reactive lymphocytes on oligodendrocytes were studied using a 51Cr release assay. MBP-reactive encephalitogenic T cell lines were cytotoxic to 51Cr-labeled oligodendrocyte target cells derived from Lewis rat fetal brain-dissociated culture, when incubated for 6 h in the presence of antigen-presenting cells (APC) and MBP ( percent 51 Cr release = 65±3% vs. spontaneous release = 22±3% vs. normal lymph node cells + APC and MBP = 20 ± 3%). This reaction is time dependent, likely MHC restricted, and is not just a nonspecific toxic effect against any Lewis target cells since neither fibroblasts nor astrocytes were affected. Other (tetanus toxoid-reactive) lymphoblasts stimulated by specific antigen were not cytotoxic to the oligodendrocytes. These findings suggest that oligodendrocytes might be target cells for MBP-reactive lymphocytes in EAE if antigen presentation is appropriate.",1
"The cells of the central nervous system (CNS) have the peculiarity of physiologically expressing very low levels of HLA molecules. In multiple sclerosis (MS), however, as in endocrine autoimmune diseases, there is a marked increase of HLA expression in the tissue (i.e. the plaques) and this is attributable not only to infiltrating cells but also to the astrocytes. To gain an insight into the regulation of HLA in the different cell types in the CNS and to compare it to that observed in the endocrine organs, we have studied the effect of the lympho/monokines interferon (IFN)-α and -γ, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and interleukin (IL)-2 and other agents on this aspect of the biology of human fetal brain cells in culture. A two-colour immunofluorescence technique which combines antibodies to diverse CNS cell markers and monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to the non-polymorphic region of HLA molecules was used throughout this study. In control cultures, only astrocytes expressed MHC class I, but after incubation with either IFN-γ or TNF-α oligodendrocytes acquired class I expression. Surprisingly, astrocytes became spontaneously class II positive in culture and this was greatly enhanced by IFN-γ. Other agents such as IL-2, epidermal growth factor, phorbolmyristate acetate and lectins had no effect. The expression of HLA molecules in the cells of the CNS both in basal conditions and in response to lymphokines is therefore selective and highly heterogenous, thus reflecting their intrinsic biological diversity. These findings may help to explain the features of the immunopathology of MS and also of latent viral infections of neural cells.",1
"The effect of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) on expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens was examined in mouse glial cells in vitro. TNF induced MHC class I, but not class II, antigen expression on the surface of astrocytes but not on oligodendrocytes. Glial cells do not normally express detectable amounts of MHC antigens. Thus TNF may play a role in the immunopathogenesis of neurologic diseases that involve MHC class I-restricted reactions.",1
"Virus-induced modulation of mouse cerebral endothelial cell class I and class II antigens by the neurotropic coronavirus, MHV-4 (JHM), was examined by flow cytometry. In susceptible BALB/c, H-2Kd was downregulated, while H-2Dd was upregulated following infection by MHV-4. In contrast, H-2K and H-2D antigens were both upregulated in either MHV-4-susceptible B10.S and (BALB/c × SJL) F1, or MHV-4-resistant SJL-derived cerebral endothelial cells following infection with this virus. Class II antigen expression was unchanged following MHV-4 infection. Virus-induced MHC class I modulation is genetically regulated, and may influence virus clearance by class I-dependent CTL.",1
"H-2 class I antigens, but not class II antigens, were detected on the surface of glial cells persistently infected with mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59) as late as 90 days post-infection. Uninfected glial cells remained negative for H-2 class I and class II surface antigens. We have previously shown that conditioned media from infected glial cell cultures (supernatants) contain a factor unrelated to infectious virus and capable of inducing H-2 class I antigens on uninfected glial cells. The synthesis of this factor appears to be dependent on production of infectious virus since the H-2 inducing activity could not be detected 3 days following the addition of neutralizing antibodies to the cultures. This suggests that H-2 inducing activity contains as unstable component, the synthesis of which is dependent on continual virus production. Persistent MHV infection and H-2 class I antigen expression may play a role in MHV-induced demyelination.",1
"Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection of mice can induce viral encephalitis. Using two-fluorochrome immunofluorescence, our present study shows that though there is extensive myelin loss and necrosis in the brain stem of mice with HSV encephalitis, only some oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglial cells are infected. T cells that express CD4 or CD8 and a large number of CD4+, F4/80+ macrophages are present in perivascular infiltrates close to and in contact with HSV-infected cells in areas of massive myelin loss. These findings suggest that the resultant infiltration of immune cells into the brain during HSV-1 infection may cause as much damage as the virus itself.",1
"Using a recently described technique for expanding of human T lymphocyte populations from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), we investigated the local cellular immune response in a patient with chronic rubella panencephalitis. A total of 328 T cell lines (TCLs) was established by seeding CSF cells at limitin dilution into histoplates in the presence of irradiated feeder cells and phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-containing conditioned medium. 80% of TCLs expressed the CD4+ CD8−, 5% the CD4− CD8+ phenotype and 15% of TCLs contained different proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ cells. Of 191 TCLs analyzed, 85 were cytotoxic, as shown by their lectin-dependent cytotoxicity against allogeneic uninfected target cells. Eight of them demonstrated specificity for the autologous, rubella virus-infected target cells. When testes for antigen-specific proliferative activity, 26 TCLs responded to rubella antigen, 16 TCLs reacted to myelin basic protein (MBP), four TCLs to proteolipid protein (PLP), four to galactocerebrosides and two to actin. Fourteen out of 16 MBP-specific TCLs also responded, to a minor degree, to rubella antigen and/or actin. The results showed that the persisting rubella infection had given rise to autoreactive T cells. Virus-induced autoreactivity to brain antigens may be an important pathogenic mechanism in other chronic inflammatory disorders of the CNS.",1
"Using a passively transferred acute model of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the rat, inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) lesions were shown to develop rapidly, peak and then resolve. An unusual feature of the lesions in the CNS was the presence of pyknotic cells within myelin sheaths. A sequence of observations indicated that such cells were lymphocytes which had insinuated themselves into the myelin sheath by passage along the interperiod line. The presence of lymphocytes within myelin sheaths, a process which did not lead to demyelination, was considered to represent a change which reflects the specificity of the immune response in this disease. The detection of this change in other CNS autoimmune diseases, notably those associated with virus infections, may be important as an indicator of pathogenetically relevant lymphocyte-myelin interactions.",1
"A single intracerebroventricular injection of 100 ng of β-endorphin altered the course of the central nervous system (CNS) infection of a temperature-sensitive mutant of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), tsG31-KS5. When mice were administered β-endorphin and then 24 h later infected intracerebrally with tsG31-Ks5 VSV, 70% of the animals died within 8 days of infection. In comparison, less than 10% of the animals had died after 21 days when infected with tsG31-KS5 VSV alone. When mice were injected with β-endorphin and tsG31-KS5 VSV simultaneously, or with β-endorphin 21 days after infection, the more aggressive clinical disease was not observed. Superficially, the more lethal disease induced by β-endorphin appeared to be a result of a mild hypothermia caused by the neuropeptide. β-Endorphin, however, did not influence the disease in nude (nu/nu) mice even though their core temperatures were reduced to an extent similar to that of BALB/c (+/+) mice, implicating the involvement of T lymphocytes in the alteration of the course of infection in normal mice.",1
"Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally with a suspension of Trypanosoma brucei. An early induction of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens as well as an infiltration of macrophage-like and cytotoxic T-cells was detected with immunohistochemical techniques in circumventricular organs, such as the median eminence, neurohypophosis, subformical organ, pineal gland and area postrema. These areas, which lack a blood-brain barrier, correspond to those showing early invasion of trypanosomes. In addition, there was a marked induction of MHC class I in neurons in two hypothalamic nuclei, The paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei. Neurons in these two nuclei are located behind the blood-brain, but project to the neurohypophysis and to the medain eminence, thereby exposing their axon terminals to factors circulating in the blod or released locally from invading trypanosomes or from macrophages or cytotoxic T-cells. It is suggested that the alteration in the nerve cell bodies in the hypothalamic nuclei is caused by retrograde axonal signals from these target areas. Sleeping sickness; Trypanosomes; Paraventricular nucleus; Major histocompatibility complex classI",1
"Neural cells, indluding astrocytes, normally do not express detectable levels of class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, unlike cells of most tissues. However, upon cultivation in vitro, astrocytes begin to express class I molecules, increasing with time after plating. This spontaneous expression was examined in the present study to characterize inducible expression on astrocytes among various strains of mice. Inducible expression, either as a consequence of cultivation or standard γ-interferon treatment, differed markedly among the strains examined. Analysis of congenic strains on a C57BL/10 (B10) background showed that expression was controlled by genes within the MHC locus. Examination of additional congeneic animals with various recombinations within the MHC showed that high or low expression of MHC molecules correlates with the presence of particular MHC class I genes. In general, H-2a and H-2d class I products are expressed much higher on astrocytes than H-2b and H-2s products. This difference in expression is not seen on spleen cells indicating tissue specificity. Moreover, levels of expression at the cell surface are reflected by the steady-state level of RNA message within astrocytes of the different strains.",1
"Astrocytes can function as antigen-presenting cells (APC) upon expression of class II antigens, which are induced by interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) can act synergistically with IFN-γ with respect to class II expression on a variety of cells. As brain cells themselves can secrete TNF-like factors upon stimulation, we examined the effect of TNF-α on IFN-γ-mediated class II induction on astrocytes. TNF-α alone had no effect on class II expression, but did synergize with IFN-γ for enhanced expression of class II antigens. The specificity of TNF-α activity was demonstrated by blocking the amplifying effect of TNF-α with a polyclonal anti-TNF-α antibody. Kinetic analysis of the synergistic effect indicated that optimal TNF-α enhancement of class II expression was observed when astrocytes were pretreated with IFN-γ 12–24 h prior to TNF-α addition. A possible mechanism for the synergistic action between IFN-γ and TNF-α may be increased TNF-α receptor expression by IFN-γ. Astrocytes treated with IFN-γ for 24 h express more TNF-α receptors (3900/cell) than do untreated astrocytes (2483/cell), with no significant change in the binding affinity (K d). These results suggest that the synergistic activity of TNF-α requires an inductive signal from IFN-γ, which in part may be increased TNF-α receptor expression. Altogether, our observations indicate that TNF-α enhances ongoing class II major histocompatibility complex gene expression in rat astrocytes, which in this system is initially induced by IFN-γ. TNF-α exerts its effect by binding to high affinity TNF-α receptors on astrocytes, whose expression is also enhanced by IFN-γ. These two cytokines work in concert to elevate class II expression on astrocytes, an event which can contribute to initiation and/or perpetuation of intracerebral immune responses.",1
"The effects of cyclosporin A (CsA) on neuropathological lesions induced by a chronic viral infection have been tested in the experimental model of the mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3) infection. Daily injections of CsA (50 mg/kg) inhibited the expression of the MHV3-induced ependymitis, meningitis, hydrocephalus and vasculitis. The effect was preserved even if CsA treatment was initiated 15 days after virus infection but was lost if CsA treatment was given later on or for a shorter period of time. Viral titers in brains of chronically infected mice were not affected by CsA treatment. During the first week following MHV3 infection, CsA treatment increased both the percentage of acute death (31 vs. 10%) and the viral titers in brain and liver of infected mice. In this model, the timing of CsA treatment appeared critical for the balance between its beneficial effect on CNS lesions and the risk of increased acute mortality.",1
"Using immunohistochemical techniques, we examined major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen expression on astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and macrophages-microglia derived from surgically resected tissue from young adults and maintained in dissociated cell cultures supplemented with either fetal calf or human AB serum. The majority of these cells in culture expressed class I MHC antigens. MHC class II expression was observed on only a restricted proportion of astrocytes either under basal or induction conditions (γ-interferon, activated lymphocyte supernatants), on the majority of macrophages-microglia under inducing conditions, and not on oligodendrocytes. MHC class II expression on astrocytes in culture did not correlate with the extent of in situ gliosis or with in vitro cell morphology. MHC antigen expression was not detected in situ immunohistochemically. These data extend observations on the dissociation of in vivo and in vitro expression of MHC antigens on glial cells. The apparent greater expression of MHC class II antigens on macrophages-microglia compared to astrocytes raises the issue of the relative roles of each of these cell types in promoting immune reactivity under pathologic conditions.",1
"Proliferation of central nervous system (CNS) glia in response to peripheral nerve injury occurs without apparent participation of cells of the immune system. It is shown here that following transection of the rat facial nerve there is strongly elevated expression of class I, and to a lesser extent, class II antigens of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in the facial nucleus. It is demonstrated by double-immunofluorescence studies that the cells responsible for increased levels of MHC class I antigens are endogenous brain microglia. These findings emphasize the thought that microglia are immunocompetent cells, but, at the same time, raise the possibility for a non-immubological function of MHC antigens under conditions of neural regeneration.",1
"West Nile virus (WNV) infection of astrocytes can up-regulate their expression of both class I and class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens as determined by flow cytometry with monoclonal antibodies specific for class I and class II MHC antigens. The up-regulation of class I MHC antigen expression could be partly caused by interferon secreted after WNV infection because the synthetic interferon inducer polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I : C) has similar effects. In contrast the up-regulation of class II MHC antigen expression was not induced by poly I : C. The increased MHC antigen expression by WNV infection had significant effects on T cell recognition. Thus, WNV and influenza virus A/WSN double-infected astrocytes but not astrocytes infected by A/WSN alone were lysed by influenza virus-immune cytotoxic T cells. Similarly, WNV-infected astrocytes were better stimulators than normal astrocytes for a class II MHC-reactive T cell line, both in terms of T cell proliferation and interleukin release.",1
"The neurotropic mouse hepatitis viruses (MHV), in particular strain JHM (JHMV or MHV-4), cause experimental central nervous system demyelination that pathologically resembles multiple sclerosis, an important human demyelinating disease. The mechanism of JHMV-induced demyelination remains unclear, though its tropism for oligodendrocytes had led to the belief that JHMV causes demyelination by direct lysis of these myelin-producing cells. However, several studies have also implicated the involvement of immune responses in the demyelinating process. In this communication, we present evidence that generalized immunosuppression with gamma irradiation prevents JHMV-induced demyelination, a finding that was not limited to a particular strain of JHMV or to one strain of mouse. In addition, significant paralytic-demyelinating disease was restored to infected, irradiated mice after the adoptive transfer of nylon wool nonadherent splenic cells and appeared to be restricted by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). These observations indicate that the principal mechanisms of JHMV-induced demyelination are most likely immunopathological.",1
The majority of human oligodendrocytes in enriched glial cell cultures expresses class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens. We used a 51Cr release assay to study the susceptibility of oligodendrocyte-enriched glial cells to MHC-restricted and non-restricted immune-mediated cytolysis. Mitogen-activated mononuclear cells induced significant lysis in a lectin-dependent cytotoxicity assay. Mononuclear cells allo-activated in a one-way mixed lymphocyte culture with E− cells from the glial cell donor induced a significantly higher degree of oligodendrocyte cytolysis than mononuclear cells activated with E− cells bearing MHC-class I antigens discordant with the glia. Cytolysis by alloactivated unfractionated lymphocytes and by purified CD8+ lymphocytes was reduced by an anti-class I antibody (W6/32). Our findings suggest that human oligodendrocytes can be susceptible targets for MHC class I-restricted lysis.,1
"The effects of irradiation on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression and lymphocytic infiltration in the normal rat brain and the 9L gliosarcoma brain tumor model were examined. Doses of irradiation administered were biologically equivalent to that used in the treatment of patients with malignant gliomas. No significant change in immune parameters was observed following irradiation in the normal rat brain. In the 9L gliosarcoma model irradiation did not suppress MHC expression or lymphocytic infiltration. These findings suggest that prior exposure to therapeutic irradiation need not adversely affect subsequent immunotherapies, and provide a foundation for future studies of immunomodulation in the irradiated brain.",1
"Astrocytes can function as antigen-presenting cells (APC) upon expression of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens, which are induced by interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Previous data from this laboratory had shown that the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) enhances IFN-γ-mediated class II antigen expression on astrocytes. We have now investigated the effect of IFN-γ and TNF-α on class II MHC mRNA expression in astrocytes using Northern blot analysis. Astrocytes do not constitutively express mRNA for class II MHC. Kinetic analysis of class II MHC mRNA expression in IFN-γ-treated cells demonstrated an 8 h time lag, which was followed by an increase over the next 16 h. Optimal expression of class II mRNA was detected after a 24 h incubation with IFN-γ. This level of expression was further enhanced by the simultaneous addition of IFN-γ and TNF-α to the astrocytes, while TNF-α alone had no effect on class II mRNA expression. TNF-α does not act by increasing the stability of IFN-γ-induced class II mRNA, indicating its action is not at that specific level of post-transcriptional control. Furthermore, astrocyte class II mRNA expression was inhibited when cycloheximide (CHX) was added together with IFN-γ or IFN-γ/TNF-α, and when CHX was added up to 4 h after treatment with IFN-γ or IFN-γ/TNF-α. These results indicate that astrocyte class II mRNA expression is mediated by newly synthesized proteins induced by IFN-γ and/or IFN-γ/TNF-α. The expression of class II antigens on astrocytes, and cytokine modulation of their expression, may be important in the initiation and perpetuation of intracerebral immune responses.",1
"Intracerebral inoculation of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) into susceptible mouse strains produces a chronic demyelinating disease in which mononuclear cell-rich infiltrates in the central nervous system (CNS) are prominent. Current evidence strongly supports an immune-mediated basis for myelin breakdown, with an effector role proposed for TMEV-specific, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-restricted delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses in which lymphokine-activated macrophages mediate bystander demyelination. The present study examined the possibility that concomitant or later-appearing neuroantigen-specific autoimmune T cell responses, such as those demonstrated in chronic-relapsing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (R-EAE), may contribute to the demyelinating process following TMEV infection. T cell responses against intact, purified major myelin proteins (myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP), and against altered myelin constituents were readily demonstrable in SJL/J mice with R-EAE, but were not detectable in SJL/J mice with TMEV-induced demyelinating disease. TMEV-infected mice also did not display T cell responses against the peptide fragments of MBP(91–104) and PLP(139–151) recently shown to be encephalitogenic in SJL/J mice. In addition, induction of neuroantigen-specific tolerance to a heterogeneous mixture of CNS antigens, via the i.v. injection of syngeneic SJL/J splenocytes covalently coupled with mouse spinal cord homogenate, resulted in significant suppression of clinical and histologic signs of R-EAE and the accompanying MBP- and PLP-specific DTH responses. In contrast, neuroantigen-specific tolerance failed to alter the development of clinical and histologic signs of TMEV-induced demyelinating disease or the accompanying virus-specific DTH and humoral immune responses. These findings demonstrate that TMEV-induced demyelinating disease can occur in the apparent absence of neuroantigen-specific autoimmune responses. The relationship of the present results to the immunopathology of multiple sclerosis is discussed.",1
"We have previously found that Lewis rat myelin basic protein (MBP)-reactive lymphocytes (Lc) were cytotoxic in vitro to cultured syngeneic oligodendrocytes (oligos). We report here additional studies to characterize this reaction. The effector lymphocytes in the cytotoxic reaction are also encephalitogenic as evidenced by the capacity of other aliquots of these cells to transfer experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). We confirmed that the presence of both MBP and antigen-presenting cells (APC) are required for this in vitro cytotoxic effect. This reaction (measured by 51Cr release from labeled oligos) is dose-dependent on the effector/target ratio with marked 51Cr release at a 20/1 ratio. Effector/target cell contact is required since: (a) 51Cr release is not significantly increased when effector Lc and oligo are separated by a micropore membrane (28% vs. 24% spontaneous release); (b) no cytotoxic activity is present in the supernatant fluid of a toxic reaction. The adhesion of 51Cr-labeled effector Lc to unlabeled oligo is increased in the presence of both MBP and APC (21 ± 1.0% of cell adhering) as compared with effector Lc + APC (12 ± 2.7%), or effector Lc alone (14 ± 2.8%). Surface expression of class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens was expressed on the surface of the target oligos during this in vitro cytotoxic reaction. This may explain our previously observed MHC restriction in this reaction. The findings described here may explain some of the in vivo pathogenic events in EAE.",1
"Subacute encephalomyelitis (SAME) in Lewis rats following infection with a neurotropic measles virus (MV) is associated with a cell-mediated autoimmune response (CMAI) to myelin badic protein (MBP). MBP-selected CD44+ T cell lines both from measles-infected animals as well as from rats challenged with guinea pig MBP (Gp-MBP) had a similar pattern of response in the presence of synthetic peptides to Gp-MBP and specifically responded in vitro only to the encephalitogenic and not the non-encephalitogenic or other control peptides. In primary splenic lymphocyte cultures from SAME animals, however, a low but significant T-cell response was obtained against the non-encephalitogenic peptide S67 (residues 69–81) of the Gp-MBP. Moreover, immunization of MV-infected rats with this peptide induced clinical and histological experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in 38% of the animals. The results of the study show that the non-encephalitogenic peptide S67 can be rendered encephalitogenic in rats when an additional stimulus is given in the form of MV infection. The data indicate further that MV infection of the central nervous system (CNS) enhances the susceptibility of the CNS to autoimmune T cell aggression.",1
"T-lymphocyte recognition of antigen either on antigen-presenting cells (APC) necessary for the generation of an immune response or on target cells during the effector phase of a cellular immune response requires expression of HLA molecules. Although immune mechanisms operate in many disease processes of the central nervous system (CNS), cells of the CNS generally express low levels of HLA molecules. In this study, the potential for upregulation of HLA molecules on adult human glial cells was examined. Moreover, the functional implication of this upregulation was assessed by the capacity of glial cells to process and present target antigens to HLA class I-restricted influenza-specific and class II-restrict myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific CTL lines. Glial cells cultured from adult human surgical brain specimens or cells from established glioblastoma multiforme cell lines were studied. Lysis by antigen-specific CTLs was dependent on treatment of the target cell with interferon-γ. The lysis was HLA restricted and antigen specific. The results indicate that adult human glial cells can process and present antigen to HLA-restricted CTLs but require the upregulation of HLA molecules. These findings have implications for infectious and autoimmune diseases of the CNS.",1
"The roles of intracellular second messengers in interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-induced Ia antigen (Ag) expression by astroglia and microglia were examined. Ia Ag on both glia types was induced by IFN-γ. Reagents known to increase intracellular cAMP or activate intracellular protein kinase C (PKC) reduced IFN-γ-induced Ia Ag expression by astroglia. In contrast, increasing intracellular cAMP had no suppressive effect on Ia Ag expression by microglia. These results indicate (1) cAMP and PKC negatively regulate IFN-γ-induced Ia expression on astroglia, and (2) Ia expression is regulated differentially in astroglia vs. microglia. These findings may explain the frequent observation of Ia+ microglia (or macrophages) but not astroglia in various neurodegenerative diseases.",1
"Antigens encoded within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are not normally expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), but can be induced by treatment with interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Other cytokines released during an inflammatory process can potentially influence MHC expression as well. One cytokine of interest is interleukin-1 (IL-1), an immunoregulatory polypeptide that is produced by macrophages and also by cells in the CNS. In this study, the effedt of IL-1β on MHC expression in a human glioblastoma multiforme cell line, U-105 MG, has been examined. Treatment of U-105 MG with 10 U IL-1β/ml for a period of 5 days resulted in a decrease in constitutive cell surface HLA class II expression and limited the induction of class II by IFN-γ. This effect was also observed on steady-state levels of class II RNA and could be neutralized with antibodies to IL-1β. All class II transcripts examined (HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP α and β) were affected. Class I expression was only marginally changed by IL-1β treatment. A minimal concentration of 1 U IL-1β/ml was required to reduce class II expression and a kinetics experiment indicated that U-105MG must be treated for at least 4 days with IL-1β for a decrease in class II expression to be observed. This study suggests that IL-1 may play a role in limiting immunoreactivity in the CNS by limiting class II induction.",1
"The protective effect of a mouse hepatitis virus type-4 (MHV-4)-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T cell clone and a CD4+ helper T cell clone was examined by the adoptive transfer into brains of mice lethally infected with MHV-4. Mice survived acute encephalitis if more than 5 × 105 cells of either type of the virus-specific T cell clones had been transfered into H-2-matched recipients by 1 day post-infection. Although the adoptive transfer of both types of the T cell clones suppressed viral growth and viral antigen-positive cells in the brains, a significant inhibition of virus replication by the cytotoxic T cell clone was detected prior to that induced by the helper T cell clone. Histologically, cell destruction was prominent in the brains of mice which received the cytotoxic T cell clone. These results demonstrate that both the CD8+ cytotoxic T cell and the CD4+ helper T cell can protect mice from a lethal MHV-4 infection in the central nervous system.",1
"Lymphocytic interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen induction were studied in experimental measles and vesicular stomatitis virus infections in the brain. Fifteen-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats injected intracerebrally with the HNT strain of measles virus showed already within 1 day after infection an increased number of cells producing IFN-γ in the spleen, cervical lymph nodes and leptomeninges. These rats recovered after a transient neuronal infection in the brain. Rats infected intracerebrally with vesicular stomatitis virus, on the other hand, all succumbed after 2 days and showed no IFN-γ production in lymphoid cells. Immunohistochemically MHC class I antigen appeared in infected and uninfected cells in the brain during replication of both viruses. A role for the recently discovered nerve fibres with IFN-γ-like immunoreactivity, which are normally present in the brain, in the MHC antigen induction is discussed.",1
"The regulation of γ-interferon-induced major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen expression on mouse cerebral endothelial cells by the neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-4, JHM) was studied in vitro. The results presented demonstrate that MHV-4 can selectively block γ-interferon-induced class II antigen expression on cerebral endothelial cells. The blocking effect of class II expression occurs in a strain-dependent manner, and is limited to virus-susceptible mouse strains. Virus replication is not required to obtain the blocking effect since UV-inactivated MHV-4 produces the same result. MHV-4 blocking of γ-interferon-induced class II antigen expression is observed at both the cell surface (flow cytometry) and transcriptional level (Norhtern analysis).",1
"Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) is a pleiotropic lymphokine produced by T-lymphocytes which acts as a soluble mediator in immunological reactions. In addition to several immune target cells, such as monocytes and macrophages, it acts on the principal glial population, the astrocytes, inducing Ia antigen expression. We have developed a binding assay for 125I-labeled recombinant murine IFN-γ, and show that, using this assay, IFN-γ interacts with a single specific receptor on the murine astrocyte cell membrane. The binding is specific and saturable and it takes place with a K d = 1.64 × 10−9 M, with 11,100 receptor molecules per astrocytic cell. The binding shows, as for macrophages, species specificity. Using an immune assay including rabbit antibodies to IFN-γ and 125I-labeled protein A, we have demonstrated an internalization of the ligand. This is an energy-dependent process, as around 50% of the bound IFN-γ is endocytosed after 4 h at 37°C when cultures are maintained in complete culture medium.",1
"It has been previously demonstrated that the generation of measles virus (MV)-specific cytotoxicity (CTL) is reduced in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). By contrast, CTL specific for influenza virus (FLU) and mumps virus is normal. It is uncertain if reduced CTL is limited to MV in MS patients, or if reduced CTL may be found to other viruses as well. Since MV-specific CTL is predominantly restricted by HLA class II molecules, while FLU-specific and mumps-specific CTL have large HLA class I-restricted components, reduced MV-specific CTL may reflect a broader reduction in HLA class II-restricted CTL in patients with MS. To examine this question we studied the generation of CTL specific for herpes simplex virus type I (HSV). HSV-specific CTL, like MV-specific CTL is predominantly restricted by HLA class II molecules. We found that patients with MS had reduced generation of CTL to both MV and HSV. Most, but not all patients who had reduced generation of CTL to one virus also had a similar impairment with respect to the second virus. Some patients, however, had a reduction in the generation of CTL only to MV or to HSV. These findings extend our earlier observations regarding reduced MV-specific CTL in patients with MS to a second HLA class II-restricted virus, HSV. Such a reduction may reflect discrete impairments in immune function to separate viruses, possibly those that are associated with viral persistence, or may reflect a more generalized defect in HLA class II-restricted CTL.",1
"The eradication of infectious virus from the central nervous system (CNS) following infection with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) is thought to be immune-mediated. Furthermore, a significant decrease of infectious virus coincides with the appearance of prominent inflammatory infiltrates in the brain and spinal cord. In the present study, mononuclear cells infiltrating the brain during JHMV infection were isolated and characterized. While all subsets of immune cells were present, there appeared to be a temporal relationship between the peak incidence of CD8+ T cells (40% of total isolated cells) and reduction of virus at day 7 post-infection. Cells with the natural killer (NK) phenotype (at least 30%) were also present throughout infection. These data suggest that CD8+ T cells and NK cells are prominent among cells which infiltrate the brain during JHM virus infection and may have important roles in reduction of virus within the CNS.",1
"Intracranial inoculation of immunocompetent mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) induces a fatal neurologic illness. In this disease a marked increase in MHC class I expression was found, closely associated with viral antigens and inflammatory infiltrates, in meninges, choroid plexus and ventricular ependyma but not within the brain parenchyma. Immunosuppression prevented MHC induction. Mice inoculated at birth had persistent infections, with LCMV antigens found primarily in neurons, but no inflammatory cells or focal increase in MHC class I. Failure of infected neurons to express MHC class I allow them to escape destruction by cytotoxic T cells (CTL) but may increase their susceptibility to be persistently infected by non-lytic viruses.",1
"The molecular basis of constitutive and inducible major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I gene expression was studied in murine astrocytes in primary culture. Astrocytes constitutively expressed MHC class I molecules and treatment of these cells with interferon-γ (IFN-γ) further induced expression. The conserved region containing the upstream MHC class I regulatory element (MHC-CRE) and juxtaposed interferon consensus sequence (ICS) enhanced consttutive MHC class I promoter activity. As seen with cell surface expression of MHC molecules, treatment of astrocytes with IFN-γ increased MHC class I promoter activity. Inducible expression required the presence of the MHC-CRE/ICS enhancer region. Nuclear factors that bind to the MHC-CRE and ICS were constitutively expressed in cultured astrocytes and IFN-γ treatment further induced binding activity both to the MHC-CRE and ICS and correlated with induction of MHC class I gene expression. This study identifies the MHC-CRE and ICS as the major cis elements in controlling MHC class I promoter activity and suggests that the expression of nuclear factor binding activities to these enhancer elements is a basic transactivating mechanism for the expression of MHC class I genes in astrocytes.",1
"The major isoform of myelin basic protein (MBP) in the healthy adult central nervous system is the 18.5-kDa protein which is produced by mRNA derived from exons 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the MBP gene. Since isoforms containing exon 2-encoded protein (X2MBP) are expressed during myelin formation, we examined T cell ractivity specific for X2MBP in a disease characterized by remyelination subsequent to demyelination, multiple sclerosis (MS). T cell lines specific for X2MBP were derived from three MS patients as well as one healthy control. This suggests that candidate autoantigens in demyelinating/remyelinating diseases should include not only the major isoforms of myelin proteins, but also isoforms expressed aberrantly during a disease process since they too may be the target of a T cell-mediated autoimmune process.",1
"To study the generation of specific antibody responses within the central nervous system (CNS), we have utilized a murine model of acute viral encephalitis. When Sindbis virus (SV) is injected intracerebrally into weanling mice it causes an acute non-fatal encephalitis and recovery is primarily dependent on the development of antiviral antibody. We used a modified enzyme-linked immunoassay to determine the number of antibody-secreting cells (ASC) specific for SV and their Ig isotype in brain, spleen and cervical lymph nodes over the course of the acute encephalitis. The numbers of SV-specific ASC peak early in spleen and lymph nodes and then begin to increase in brain, suggesting that initial stimulation of B cells occurs primarily in peripheral lymphoid tissue followed by B cell entry into the circulation and appearance in the brain. The pattern for each individual isotype was similar with peak numbers of SV-specific cells present in the spleen 5–7 days after infection, while numbers in the brain continue to rise through day 20 when most ASC were secreting IgG2a or IgA SV-specific antibody. The data suggest therefore that most isotype switching from IgM to IgG and IgA occurs in peripheral lymphoid tissue. An exception to this pattern is IgG1, where numbers of ASC producing IgG1 do not show a peak in spleen and continue to rise in brain through the course of acute encephalitis. The data also indicate that early in infection a large proportion of ASC in the brain are not specific for SV and demonstrate that recruitment of ASC into the CNS is non-specific. However, the percentage of ASC that are specific for SV structural proteins rises steadi throughout the course of encephalitis suggesting that retention of ASC in the CNS is specific or that some portion of the SV-specific antibody response is generated within the CNS.",1
"The neurotropic murine coronavirus, MHV-JHM (JHMV) causes encephalitis and paralytic-demyelinating disease in susceptible strains of mice and rats, serving as a model for human demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. In this communication, we report that a single intracerebral administration of the naturally occurring neuropeptide, β-endorphin, reduced the incidence of JHMV-induced paralytic-demyelinating disease 40–50% in C57Bl/6 mice. Protection from disease was accompanied by significantly reduced virus replication in the brain as early as 3 days post-infection and did not occur in irradiated, or immunoincompetent mice. The data suggest that β-endorphin engages immune mechanisms of host resistance to JHMV infection to protect the mice from disease.",1
"Theiler's virus GD VII strain causes acute encephalomyelitis by intracerebral inoculation. We established acute encephalomyelitis in mice by the intravenous (i.v.) inoculation of Theiler's virus GD VII strain. Replication of Theiler's virus injected i.v. could be observed in both the brain and spinal cord of mice, and interferon (IFN)-γ could be detected in the extracts of brain and spinal cord in parallel with viral replication. Furthermore, by the injection of anti-IFN-γ monoclonal antibody (mAb) on Day 1 post-infection (p.i.), mortality and virus titres in the spinal cord increased compared with the control mice treated with normal rat globulin. The histological exacerbation of inflammation was observed in spinal cord of anti-IFN-γ mAb-treated mice. These results indicate that endogenous IFN-γ, produced locally in the brain and spinal cord of mice through both antiviral action and anti-inflammatory action of IFN-γ in central nervous system, plays an important role in Theiler's virus infection.",1
"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) induction, as detected by bioassay and Northern analysis, was examined in vitro in endothelial cells or astrocytes derived from BALB/c (susceptible) or SJL (resistant) mice following exposure to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-4) or UV inactivated MHV-4 (UV-MHV-4). In BALB/c endothelial cells, up to 16-fold more IL-6 (> 640 U/ml) was induced, compared to SJL cells which showed a minimal response (40 U/ml), relative to basal levels (< 20 U/ml). In contrast, both BALB/c and SJL astrocytes showed a substantial IL-6 response to MHV-4 and UV-MHV-4 exposure, although a strain difference persisted. Despite strain and cell specific differences in released IL-6, equivalent levels of IL-6 mRNA were induced in all cell types following exposure to MHV-4 or UV-MHV-4.",1
"We have used cell or tissue-specific promoters to express lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) proteins in selected cells in independent lines of transgenic mice. Upon adoptive transfers into these mice, MHC-restricted LCMV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes homed specifically to either the choroid plexus (SV40 promoter) or β cells of the islets of Langerhans (rat insulin promoter). The availability of promoters specific for neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes makes this approach compelling for evaluating T cell trafficking into the CNS and for analyzing antigen presentation in vivo in the CNS.",1
"Although the major isoform of myelin basic protein (MBP) in the healthy adult CNS is the 18.5-kDa protein, other isoforms containing exon 2 encoded protein (21.5 kDa and 20.2 kDa) exist and are expressed primarily during myelin formation. Since remyelination is a prominent feature in MS lesions, we examined the frequencies of T cell lines (TCLs) specific for epitopes within exon 2 encoded MBP (X2MBP), and also within 18.5-kDa MBP, in members of a multiplex family with MS. TCLs specific for X2MBP were as prevalent as TCLs specific for immunodominant epitopes within 18.5-kDa MBP. In addition, while frequencies of TCLs specific for 18.5-kDa MBP were no different between the affected and unaffected, the frequency of X2MBP-specific TCLs correlated with disease.",1
"The questions how a viral infection induces cellular autoimmune reactions (CMAI) and which components of both virus and auto-antigen play part in this process were addressed in our animal model of measles virus (MV)-induced CMAI against myelin basic protein (MBP) during subacute measles encephalitis (SAME). In an attempt to define whether cellular or humoral immune responses are involved in the occurrence of the autoimmune based disease process, Lewis rats were treated with different combinations of antibodies and T cells reactive with either MV and its structural proteins or MBP and MBP-peptides. The only treatment combination after which experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE)-like disease and pathology developed was when non-encephalitogenic T cells reactive against residues 69–81 of MBP were adoptively transferred into MV-infected Lewis rats. The results of the study show that T cells which are non-encephalitogenic in the normal central nervous tissue are capable of inducing an allergic encephalomyelitis in animals with a viral infection involving the brain.",1
"We recently found that microglia, brain macrophages, express interleukin-4 (IL-4) receptor mRNA in vitro. Since IL-4 exhibits a variety of functions on the cells of monocyte-macrophage lineage, we examined the effects of IL-4on the functions of microglia. Recombinant IL-4 induced the proliferation of microglia in a dose- and time-dependent manner as determined by MTT colorimetric assay, [3H]thymidine uptake and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. IL-4 also synergistically enhanced the proliferation of microglia with such colony-stimulating factors as IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). It also increased acid phosphatase activity and superoxide anion formation by these cells. Despite these positive effects on proliferation and activation, IL-4 suppressed the IFN γ-induced class II MHC antigen expression in these cells. Since these effects of recombinant IL-4 inhibited by the addition of monoclonal antibody against IL-4 receptors, the effects of IL-4 on microglia appear to be a specific function via IL-4 receptors. Although microglia and astrocytes produce a variety of immunoregulatory cytokines, neither cell produced IL-4 as determined by bioassay or detection of IL-4 mRNA by RT-PCR method. Thus, the exogenous IL-4 may contribute to the accumulation of microglia in or around inflammatory lesions in the central nervous system, and may be involved in the regulatory mechanisms of microglia.",1
"The CD4+ T lymphocyte response in the central nervous system (CNS) and cervical lymph nodes (CLNs) of rats with different susceptibility to coronavirus-induced encephalitis was investigated. The majority of CD4+ T lymphocytes entering the virus-infected CNS in the course of the infection are primed cells that neither proliferate ex vivo nor can be stimulated to proliferation by viral antigens or mitogen in vitro. In contrast, T lymphocytes taken from CLNs of the same animals revealed a strong proliferative response. Restimulation of CLN lymphocytes by viral antigens disclosed a striking difference between the disease-resistant rat strain Brown Norway (BN) and the susceptible Lewis (LEW) strain. Whereas BN lymphocytes responded as early as 5 days post infection, it took more than 11 days until a comparable proliferation was detectable in LEW lymphocytes. From these data we postulate that the majority of T lymphocytes entering the virus-infected brain after sensitisation and expansion in cervical lymph nodes is unresponsive to further proliferation signals and that the kinetics and magnitude of T lymphocyte stimulation in CLNs play an important role in the clinical course of the infection.",1
"Immunization with a synthetic peptide with an amino acid sequence corresponding to mouse myelin basic protein exon-2 induced mild experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE) in B10.RIII mice, very mild disease in SJL/J mice and no disease in (SJL × PL)F1 hybrid mice. In contrast, adoptive transfer of an exon-2 peptide-specific T cell line from SJL mice induced severe relapsing EAE in syngeneic recipients. The T cell line was specific for exon-2 peptide and did not cross-react appreciably with an MBP preparation consisting of the 18.5 and 14-kDa isoforms. mRNA for exon-2 containing isoforms could be demonstrated in the spinal cord of SJL/J and B10.RIII mice by amplification using exon-2 and exon-4 oligonucleotide primers. On a relative basis, the level of exon-2 cDNA was lower than that of exon-1 cDNA in the same spinal cord preparations from both strains of mice.",1
"The discovery of T lymphocytes reactive to the peptide encoded by exon 2 of the myelin basic protein (MBP) gene in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients has drawn attention to MBP isoforms harboring that peptide as candidate autoantigens. Previously, immunological studies in MS had almost exclusively used the more abundant 18.5 kDa isoform of MBP, which does not does not contain the exon 2 peptide. Investigations of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) have also focussed on the 18.5 kDa MBP isoform and its peptides. Since EAE is an animal model widely used widly used to study MS, we examined the encephalitogenic potential of exon 2 peptide in the SJL/J mouse. Evidence for increased expression of exon 2-containing isoforms during remyelination in mouse CNS suggested that exon 2-sensitized T cels, with encephalitogenic capacity, might be important in the pertuation of relapsing EAE (rEAE). Our experiments have demonstrated that exon 2 peptide is inherently immunogenic in SJL mice and that EAE could be induced by the adoptive transfer of exon 2-sensitized lymphocytes. Furthermore, the disease could be accentuated by the transfer of short-term exon 2-reactive lines or by a combination of adoptive transfer and antigenic challenge with exon 2 peptide. The immunodominant epitope(s) appeared to localize to the segment bordered by amino acids 59–85.",1
"Previously we reported that a lethal strain of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infects the brain following ocular inoculation of mice. We now demonstrate that HSV-2 mediates an unusual intracellular sequestering of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens. With use of an RNase protection assay, we observed a selective inhibition of IFN-γ and IL-6 gene transcription in brains of mice infected with HSV-2. It is likely that the inhibition of cytokine gene expression was mediated through a failure to activate CD4+ lymphocytes. These data suggest that the infecting herpesvirus can influence the profile of intracerebrally produced cytokines, which in turn may determine the outcome of the infection.",1
"Infection with an avirulent strain of Semliki Forest virus (SFV-A7) facilitates the development of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in a genetically resistant BALB/c mouse strain. Irradiation which is necessary for EAE induction caused a decrease in the total number of lymphocytes and an increase in CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio in the spleen of BALB/c mice. EAE induction increased the ratio further until clinical and histological signs of EAE appeared. Entry of perivascular CD4+ and CD8+ cells preceded the onset of clinical signs and the appearance of MAC-1+ cells in the central nervous system (CNS). In the acute phase of EAE, cellular infiltrates, which were sparse, consisted mainly of MAC-1+ cells and a few CD4+ and CD8+ cells. Inflammatory cells gradually disappeared during the recovery phase. SFV-A7 infection after irradiation and EAE induction did not significantly change the CD4+/CD8+ ratio in the spleen or in the CNS infiltrates but enhanced the entry of inflammatory cells into the CNS. Similar perivascular cell influx was also seen in untreated mice infected with SFV-A7. We conclude that observed rapid reduction of splenic mononuclear cells and increase of the CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio caused by irradiation prior EAE induction are early crucial events in disease induction in this resistant strain of mice. SFV-A7 infection, which further facilitates the development of EAE, does not induce immunoregulatory changes but provides its effect by enhancing the entry of inflammatory cells into the CNS. The combination of these two mechanisms thus effectively breaks the natural resistance against EAE in this genetically resistant mouse strain.",1
"Astrocytes provide crucial support for neurons and their impairment by viruses or their interactions with anti-viral or autoimmune responses could contribute to neurological disease. We have developed a transgenic mouse model to assess lymphocyte-astrocyte interactions. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule, Db, was expressed in astrocytes under the transcriptional control of regulatory sequences from the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) gene. Baseline cerebral MHC class I mRNA levels from transgenic mice were elevated over those of non-transgenic controls, and a prominent increase in cerebral MHC class I expression occurred following focal, injury-induced astroglial activation within transgenic brains but not in non-transgenic controls. FACS analysis of explant astrocyte cultures from established transgenic lines demonstrated astroglial expression of the GFAP-Db fusion gene at the protein level. Functional antigen-presenting capacity was conferred by the Db transgene, as virus-infected primary astrocytes obtained from transgenic BALB/c mice (KdIdDdLd) expressing the Db molecule were lysed by Db-restricted anti-viral CTL.",1
"The intravenous infection of Theiler's virus GD VII strain causes acute encephalomyelitis in infected mice. To determine the cellular mechanism of resistance and interferon (IFN)-γ-producing cell populations, mononuclear cells isolated from tissues of the brain were analyzed by the flow cytometry method. Antibodies specific for CD3, CD4, CD8, T cell receptor (TCR)-αβ, and Asialo GM1 were used to deplete the corresponding cell populations in Theiler's virus-infected mice. CD4+ lymphocytes and CD8+ lymphocytes infiltrated in the brains of infected mice from 5 days postinfection (p.i.). The number of CD3+/TCR-γδ+ lymphocytes increased in the brains on Day 6 p.i. The elimination of CD3+ lymphocytes or CD4+ lymphocytes augmented viral replication and suppressed the production of IFN-γ. The suppression of IFN-γ production by anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) persisted, although the suppression by anti-CD4 mAb was observed only on Day 6 p.i. The depletion of CD8+ lymphocytes as well as TCR-αβ+ lymphocytes also augmented the viral replication; however, it did not alter the production of IFN-γ. Anti-Asialo GM1 antibody had no effect on viral replication and IFN-γ production. These results indicate that T lymphocytes are important for eliminating Theiler's virus from the brain, CD3+/CD4+/CD8− lymphocytes and CD3+/TCRαβ−/CD4−/CD8− lymphocytes would produce IFN-γ in brain. However, from the result on the experiment of the depletion of TCR-αβ+ lymphocytes, the defence mechanisms by T lymphocytes against Theiler's virus would be independent of endogenous IFN-γ production.",1
"Murine retinal glia are normally negative for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class II antigens and express low levels of MHC Class I and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) as detected by avidin-biotin-peroxidase immunohistochemistry. These surface molecules associated with immune function were either induced (Class II) or upregulated (Class I and ICAM-1) on cultured retinal glial cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner following exposure to recombinant Interferonγ (rIFN-γ). MHC Class I and II expression by passaged and primary cells was maximal (> 90% positive) after incubation with 100 U/ml of rlFN-y for 48 h. ICAM-1 expression by primary and passaged cells tripled between 48 and 72 h after exposure to 25 or 50 U/ml of rIFN-γ. By 72 h after exposure to 100 U/ml of rIFN-y, 62% of the retinal glia were positive for ICAM-1, whereas under normal culture conditions these molecules were detected on < 3% of the retinal glia. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a known stimulator of central nervous system (CMS) astrocytes, increased ICAM-1 expression only 3-fold to 9% of cells staining positively, but neither MHC Class I nor Class II expression was altered from baseline levels. Surface expression of ICAM-1, MHC Class I, and MHC Class II was unaffected by exposure to either rTNF-α (1000 U/ml) or rIL-6 (100 U/ml) for 24 h. Under normal culture conditions, intracellular interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were detected immunohistochemically. Exposure to either rIFN-γ or LPS induced more intense staining which correlated with increased secreted levels of both cytokines in culture supernatants. Levels of secreted TNF-α increased 6-fold after stimulation with LPS for 24 h, while secreted IL-6 increased over 9-fold. These results support the hypothesis that retinal glia may participate in intraretinal immune processes following stimulation during inflammatory and infectious processes via either cell surface- or soluble mediator-dependent mechanisms or a combination of both.",1
"We have previously shown that leukocyte cultures of children suffering from recurrent respiratory tract infections produce less interferon (IFN) than those of healthy children. In the present study this tentative marker of recurrent infections was used to study the pathogenetic background of otitis media with effusion (OME). Altogether 57 consecutive children, aged 2–11 years, who came for tympanostomy and/or adenoidectomy were divided into three subgroups: 25 of them had OME and a history of recurrent acute otitis media (rAOM/OME +), 20 had OME without an infectious background (inf- /OME +), and 12 had a history of recurrent upper respiratory infections (inf +/OME —) without OME. All the children were free of acute illness at the time of sampling. Differences between the groups were seen in IFN yields when leukocyte cultures were stimulated with adeno-, rhino-, corona-, respiratory syncytial or influenza A viruses. Leukocytes from inf- /OME + children produced more IFN than those of the other two groups. Though no sex differences in the IFN responses were seen among rAOM/OME + and inf + /OME- children, leukocytes from inf- /OME + girls produced significantly higher amounts of IFN than those of inf- /OME + boys, or rAOM/OME + and inf + /OME- children. These differences between clinically different groups of children support the view that the etiology of OME can be heterogeneous.",1
"Purified rubella virus treated with Triton X-100 was subjected to centrifugation in a sucrose density gradient containing nonionic detergent β-D-octylglucoside. The result of this treatment was the formation of hemagglutinating rosettes containing viral glycoproteins VP2 (50,000 mol. wt.) and VP3 (63,000 mol. wt.). The rosettes have a 26 S sedimentation coefficient and a density of 1.2 g/cm3 in sucrose. Electron microscopy revealed 15 nm rosettes with a hollow center. The molecular weight of the rosettes was extrapolated at 850,00",1
"A solid-phase radioimmunoassay is described for the detection of antibodies to mouse hepatitis virus. Viruses were purified by velocity and isopycnic gradient centrifugation and 96-well plastic plates were coated with viral antigens. To allow the detection of most serotypes of low titered antisera, a pool of antigens from several viral serotypes were employed. The second antibody, an affinity-purified goat antimouse immunoglobulin, detects IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies. This assay is more sensitive than either the plaque reduction assay or the commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay and proved to be useful for screening mouse colonies for the presence of mouse hepatitis virus, following seroconversion in experimental animals and in the production of monoclonal antibodies to both structural and nonstructural proteins.",1
"A clone was selected from the MRC-C continuous heteroploid cell line which was significantly better than MRC-C for the culture of human respiratory coronavirus (HCV) 229E, strain LP. Such clones could prove generally useful for the isolation of HCV-229E from clinical specimens, and for the propagation and assay of laboratory adapted strains.",1
An enzyme immunoassay was developed to identify and quantify infectious murine parvovirus. The assay was as sensitive as the fluorescent focus test for quantification of virus in clinical material and was less labor-intensive. Viral infectivity could be inactivated with formalin prior to performance of the enzyme immunoassay. Specificity of the reaction product was shown by neutralization of infectivity using a hyperimmune rabbit antiserum to murine parvovirus.,1
"Recent studies have provided physicochemical and electron microscopic evidence for the existence of two distinct agents of posttransfusion non-A, non-B (NANB) hepatitis. One of these agents is chloroform-resistant and is not associated with the formation of unique ultrastructural structures in infected liver. The other agent is CHCl3-sensitive, induces the formation of characteristic hepatocyte cytoplasmic tubules, and interferes with concurrent HAV or HBV infection in experimentally inoculated chimpanzees. The tubule-forming agent (TFA) has also been shown to pass through an 80 nm capillary pore membrane filter, suggesting that it is a small enveloped (or lipid-containing) virus. The TFA can also be recovered from low titer (⩽ 105 infectious doses/ml) chronic-phase chimpanzee plasma by use of a multi-step purification procedure that assumes the agent is a small enveloped RNA virus with an approximate buoyant density of 1.24 g/cm3 and a sedimentation coefficient of 200–280 S. The apparent lack of nucleic acid homology between the NANB-TFA and HBV further suggests that the NANB-TFA is either Togavirus-like or belongs to another or as yet undefined class of RNA or DNA virus.",1
An efficient method for the generation of gene banks from large RNA viruses is described using infectious bronchitis virus as an example. Randomly primed clones have been characterized and found to be representative of the viral genome including 5' leader sequences.,1
"The growth of prototype strains of 31 serotypes of ECHO, 3 polio, 6 Coxsackie B, 24 Coxsackie A and enterovirus serotypes 70 and 71 were tested in parallel in primary monkey kidney cells (PMK), RD cells and three gut tumour-derived differentiated epithelial cell lines (HRT-18 HT-29 in SKCO-1). All 31 serotypes of ECHO viruses grew in HT-29, 27 and SKCO-1, 5 in HRT-18, 29 in PMK and 29 in RD. There was good growth of poliovirus serotypes in all five cell types. Coxsackie B viruses grew well in all the cell lines except RD. Fifteen of the Coxsackie A viruses grew in SKCO-1, 4 in HT-29, 3 in HRT-18 and 7 in RD. Enterovirus serotypes 70 and 71 grew only in RD cells after 3 serial passages. These results showed that 2 of the gut tumour-derived cell lines, HT-29 and SKCO-1 had a markedly wider susceptibility, with comparable or wider sensitivity, for enteroviruses, than PMK and RD. While their use for field isolation from clinical samples is not yet fully established HT-29 and SKCO-1 would appear to be ideal for a variety of laboratory manipulations of the majority of enteroviruses.",1
"Immunoadsorbents, made with monoclonal antibodies, were used to purify the spike and membrane proteins of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The purified proteins were inoculated into rabbits to produce antisera. The rabbit anti-spike sera neutralized the infectivity of the virus whereas the anti-membrane sera did not. IBV-infected chickens produced antibodies to both the spike and membrane proteins. Both these antibodies were at their highest concentration about 9–11 days after inoculation, whereas neutralizing antibodies were present only at very low concentrations at that time. Neutralizing antibodies were at their highest concentration 21 days after inoculation. A second inoculation of virus at 42 days induced an anamnestic antibody response to the spike and membrane proteins and also for the neutralizing antibodies. The neutralizing, anti-spike and anti-membrane antibodies all reached highest concentrations 7–11 days after this inoculation. The advantages of purifying viral proteins using affinity chromatography with monoclonal antibodies are discussed.",1
"Sera from 526 old-world primates representing 50 different species were screened by ELISA for antibodies to human T-lymphotropic viruses I and III, and simian retrovirus type 1 (SRV-1). About onefourth of the sera were positive by ELISA. There was a tendency, however, for the same sera to be positive for all three human and simian retroviruses. Only about one in five of the ELISA antibodypositive sera were confirmed to be positive by Western blotting. False-positive ELISA antibody tests were particularly common among sera from mandrills, crab-eating macaques, lion-tailed macaques, African green monkeys, and DeBrazza's and moustached guenons. Sera that were falsely positive in ELISA antibody tests to the three human and simian retroviruses were found to contain antibodies that reacted at comparable intensity with feline leukemia, infectious peritonitis and panleukopenia viruses. The false anti-viral activity of these sera was found to be due to antibodies that reacted with non-viral proteins that were copurified with all five virus preparations. These proteins were present in normal cat and human cells used to grow the various viruses and in gelatin. The implications of nonspecific cell-protein antibodies in primate sera were discussed in the light of this and previous seroepidemiologic studies of man and old-world monkeys.",1
"Faecal specimens from 520 patients with non-bacterial, gastroenteritis were examined by electron microscopy using four methods. These were (1) a direct dip method, (2) low-speed centrifugation, (3) ultracentrifugation and (4) a calcium phosphate method. The calcium phosphate method combined with low-speed centrifugation (750 × g, 2,100 × g) was considered overall best. The calcium phosphate method makes it possible to handle a large number of faecal specimens by saving considerable time and labour.",1
"Two enzyme immunoassays for detection of antibody to rodent coronaviruses were compared. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), strain JHM, antigen was in the form of formalin-fixed, infected 17 C1 1 cells. This antigen detected antibody to the homologous strain of MHV as well as to two heterologous MHV strains and a serologically related rat coronavirus, sialodacryodenititis virus. Antibody titers in assays using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated or ureiase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were substantially higher than in an indirect immunofluorescence assay. The ureiase assay was somewhat more sensitive than the HRP assay. MHV-JHM antigen was stable under a variety of storage conditions for at least two months.",1
"This paper deals with a method of using unknown serum as the first antibody to coat wells of the microtiter plate directly in application of the sandwich ELISA method with double antibodies for the assay of the antibody against adult diarrhoea rotavirus. This method was used for assay of the antibody against adult rotavirus in 1,380 sera of healthy adults obtained from some provinces and cities of China, of which 141 showed a positive result with a total positive rate of 10.2%. The infection rate varied in different regions. In order to confirm the accuracy of these results a blocking test was carried out on 25 positive specimens, and the results revealed that the P/N ratios after blocking were all lower than those before blocking. Seventeen of these 25 positive serum specimens were obtained from rural areas of Qian'an County, Hebei Province where epidemic adult diarrhoea had occurred two years ago. The antibody against adult diarrhoea rotavirus was not detected in 50 adult sera from Xizang Autonomous Region. Only one out of 50 adult sera from Hainan Island was positive for the antibody.",1
"An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) which detects rhinovirus specific antibody in human sera and nasal secretions, has been developed. This sandwich ELISA utilizes a rabbit antirhinovirus hyperimmune serum as the capture antibody and was found to be very sensitive, detecting rhinovirus specific antibody in the serum at dilutions of 1:106 and 1:103.5 and IgA immunoglobulins, respectively. Thus, this new assay is 102–104 times more sensitive than our standard neutralization test. Furthermore, this increase in sensitivity has enabled us to reliably detect rhinovirus specific immunoglobulins in unconcentrated nasal washings, which are thought to be particularly important for protection against rhinovirus reinfection. A preliminary study of the immune response in human volunteers challenged with rhinovirus using this new ELISA system is presented and further applications and potential of the method are also discussed.",1
"Trifluorothymidine (TFT) is known to be concentrated in herpes simplex virus (HSV) infected cells in vitro in the form of phosphorylated derivatives. We studied a murine hepatitis model of HSV infection to determine whether this in vitro observation would also be demonstrable in vivo. Following i.v. injection of 100 or 160 mg/kg TFT, TFT was found in significantly higher concentrations in the livers of HSV-2 infected mice than in the livers of uninfected mice, mice infected with murine hepatitis virus (MHV-A59) or mice with hepatitis from carbon tetrachloride treatment. Neither altered renal function, nor altered pharmacokinetics could account for this difference. 19F Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy readily detected the 19F from TFT in both liver extracts and whole livers, particularly at higher tissue levels, i.e. > 50 μg/g tissue. If further studies with living animals support these preliminary observations, clinical application could be pursued.",1
A number of viruses have been shown to be transmitted by the airborne route. It is the ability of these viruses to retain their infectivity for living hosts which play a key role in their aerial dissemination. Data generated by a number of workers on the airborne survival of viruses varies considerably because laboratory techniques have not been standardized. About 5 yr ago we started studies on the airborne survival of a number of animal and human viruses. This paper describes the methodology developed to study the aerobiology of these viruses. These methods should be useful in the aerobiological work of other viruses.,1
A d-xylose absorption test has been standardized for use in newborn mice. It was used to measure small intestine dysfunction in neonate mice following infection with various isolates of rotaviruses. A xylose dose of 1 mg/g body weight was required to produce a maximum level of 100 μg/100 μl of plasma 2 h after administration of d-xylose. The mice inoculated with rotavirus absorbed significantly less d-xylose compared with uninoculated control mice. A micromethod is described which proved to be suitable to quantitate d-xylose for determination of absorptive function of the small intestine in small animals such as newborn mice.,1
"A solid phase colloidal gold immunoelectron microscopy (IGEM) technique for detecting bovine coronavirus (BCV) was developed and shown to be specific. This test was compared with three other diagnostic tests using fifteen faecal samples. Bovine coronavirus was detected in 2 samples by direct electron microscopy (DEM), in 3 samples by immunosorbent electron microscopy, in 5 samples by haemadsorption-elution-haemagglutination and in 6 samples by IGEM. Ninety four faecal samples were tested by DEM and IGEM. Of 26 samples found to contain BCV by IGEM only 14 were positive by DEM. The IGEM technique is simple, efficient and less susceptible than others to non-specific reactions.",1
"This study compares the detection of enterovirus RNA by cDNA probes prepared from both the 5' and 3' end of the genome of coxsackíe A21 and B4 with the use of synthetic oligonucleotides prepared from short but highly conserved sequences in the 5' end non-coding region of the picornavirus genome. The cDNA probes detected enteroviruses with a variable level of sensitivity which presumably depended on the degree of genomic homology with the detecting probes. Generally probes from coxsackievirus A21 detected more enteroviruses than did similar probes from coxsackievirus B4. Probes from the 5' end of the genome of both viruses were more sensitive than 3' end probes. In contrast, synthetic oligonucleotides detected all enteroviruses efficiently suggesting that these probes could be useful as ‘universal’ probes to detect any enterovirus. This paper discusses the application of these probes in the diagnosis and differentiation of enteroviruses.",1
"A procedure is described for the rapid isolation of canine distemper virus nucleocapsid, free from contaminating viral non-core and host cellular proteins. Nucleocapsid isolated in this manner is amenable to ultrastructural evaluation, protein isolation for the production of monospecific hyperimmune serum, and genomic RNA isolation for cDNA cloning. Nucleocapsid (NC) and a defective NC variant (Df-NC) isolated from 5.5 × 107 Vero cells infected with Ond-CDV is readily visualized on cesium gradients. The calculated density for NC is 1.2976 ± 0.0033 g/ml and 1.2458 ± 0.0056 g/ml for Df-NC. Ultrastructurally, NC appears as long uninterrupted strands, 1.6 ± 0.1 μm in length, 21.2 ± 1.7 nm in diameter, with well defined capsid subunits. Df-NC are truncated with a uniform length of 85.8 ± 7.1 nm and a 24.5 ± 1.3 nm diameter. A total of 2.1 ± 0.2 μ of NC protein is obtained for every 1 × 106 cells infected; 89.7% of this mass is represented by a 61 kDa protein (N), 8.4% by a 75 kDa protein (P), and 1.9% by a 160–200 kDa protein (L), which is in agreement with the NC constituency of other paramyxoviruses. Viral N and P proteins, purified by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, were used in the production of hyperimmune serum. Specificity was demonstrated by Western blot analysis. Both antisera were capable of detecting viral antigen in persistently and lytically CDV infected cells by indirect immunofluorescence. A single high molecular weight species of nucleic acid was isolated from purified nucleocapsids compatible with a 14.6 kb morbillivirus genome. Although the efficiency of RNA extraction from purified NC was low (14.2%), sufficient RNA was obtained for gel analysis and the establishment of genomic RNA cDNA clones.",1
"The growth of the murine coronavirus MHV-A59 on murine DBT cells adapted to dextran-made Cytodex 1 microcarriers was studied in comparison with cells grown on plastic dishes. With a microcarrier concentration of 5 g/l in spinner flasks, a density of 3 × 106 cells/ml was reached in 7 days. Under these conditions, cells supported virus growth to the same extent as when they were grown on the plastic substratum. This was shown by a similar development of virus-induced syncytia, the release of an equivalent number of infectious progeny virions per cell, similar recoveries observed after concentration and purification and an identical appearance of the purified virus under the electron microscope. On the other hand, the technical convenience of microcarriers and the ease of scale-up emphasize their potential for the growth of coronaviruses.",1
"This paper describes the development and evaluation of in situ hybridization (ISH) for the detection of rhinovirus in cells obtained from nasal washings of volunteers infected with human rhinovirus 14 (HRV-14). Twenty-five (66%) and 27 (71%) of 38 volunteers inoculated with HRV-14 had evidence of infection by virus isolation and ISH, respectively, on at least one of 4 days investigated after virus challenge. In contrast, only 14 of 38 (37%) volunteers had significant antibody rises as detected by the neutralization test. Of the 38 volunteers inoculated with HRV-14, only 13 (34%) had symptoms of colds. Of these, 12 (92%) and 10 (77%) were positive by virus isolation or ISH, respectively, on at least one day. Six (46%) had significant antibody rises by neutralization. Similarly, of the 38 volunteers challenged, 22 (58%) were asymptomatic and of these 10 (45.5%) and 12 (54.5%) were positive by virus isolation and ISH, respectively, on at least one day. Only 8 (36.4%) of these asymptomatic volunteers showed significant antibody rises by neutralization. There were significant associations between the detection of rhinoviruses by ISH and virus isolation on the third day (P<0.025) after virus challenge in the group as a whole and in the symptomatic group. These results show that generally rhinovirus detection by ISH compares well with virus isolation and both tests are clearly more sensitive than the neutralization test in detecting evidence of infection. It is concluded that ISH is an interesting new technique that may play an important role in the study of rhinovirus infection and pathogenesis.",1
"The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to synthesize ds and ss probes for the detection of bovine coronavirus (BCV) using recombinant plasmids as template molecules. The ds probes detected a minimum of about 2 × 105 viral genomes after exposure for 1 h, a detection limit similar to nick-translated probes after exposure of the films for 60 h. More than 8 h exposure to blots probed with these ds probes resulted in complete darkening of the film. The ss probes, synthesized by asymmetric PCR on linearized plasmids, permitted the detection of 5 × 104 genomes, which equalled the capacity of random-primed probes. Prolonged exposure did not increase the background as in case of ds PCR-probed blots. Probes, synthesized by asymmetric PCR and random-priming were labeled to similar specific activities and were better in terms of sensitivity and detectability as opposed to nick-translated probes. However, the specificity of detection with ss probes as to random primed probes was increased further. About 10 viral genomes, after fragment-specific amplification by PCR, were detected by agarose-gel analysis. PCR-probe synthesis was simple, highly reproducible, and allowed the synthesis of probes for specific fragments.",1
"Swine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV), 67N strain, adapted to suckling mouse brain, grew readily in a porcine cell line, SK-K cell culture with cytopathic effect (CPE) consisting of syncytium formation and detachment of fused cells and round cells from glass surface. After further passages in SK-K cell monolayers with undiluted culture fluid, CPE developed earlier and became complete within 48 h postinoculation (p.i.). Viral specific antigen was detected in the cytoplasm of the infected SK-K cells by indirect immunofluorescence using rabbit antiserum against the mouse-passaged virus. The SK-K-passaged virus as well as the original mouse-passaged virus formed clear plaques on SK-K cell monolayers under simple overlay medium. The plaque assay system for HEV 67N was established by studying various factors influencing the plaque formation in the SK-K cell cultures. By this system more than 106 PFU/0.2 ml of the virus yield was detected in the fluid phase of the infected cultures at 48 h p.i. The SK-K-passaged virus caused fatal infection in 4-week-old mice by intracerebral inoculation, but was inhibited by rabbit antiserum against the mouse-passaged virus. Plaque formation and hemagglutinating activity of the virus were specifically inhibited by antisera against the mouse-passaged and SK-K-passaged 67N virus.",1
"The temporal manifestation of bovine parainfluenza-3 virus (BPI3V) proteins in the cytoplasm and on the surface of bovine embryonic lung (BEL) cells was characterized by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) and hemadsorption (HAd) assays. Intracellular proteins appeared earliest at 0.5 h post inoculation (p.i.) and the infection spread to virtually all cells by 48 h p.i. Viral proteins on the surface of cells were seen first at 16 h p.i., and by 48 h p.i. the entire cell monolayer was IFA positive. Hundred-fold less virus in the inoculum delayed appearance of the intracellular as well as cell-surface viral proteins by 24 h and allowed the infection of only about 1 3 of the cells by 48 h p.i. Kinetics of the development in the proportion of HAd-positive cells correlated with those of the surface fluorescence-positive cells. Morphology of the manifestation of BPI3V proteins is characterized by microphotography.",1
"Viral proteins of two strains of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which have different tissue trophism and serology, were separated on the basis of their isoelectric points (pI). The viruses have four structural proteins; the protein of greatest serological importance is found at the peplomer tip. The viral structural proteins separated by isoelectric focusing were identified by comparison to SDS-PAGE separations. Three protein bands were identical in pI and one protein band showed a difference in pI between strains. When the renatured viral proteins were Western blotted and reacted with strain-specific antiserum, antigen-antibody complexing was seen only at points corresponding to the strain-specific variant bands. For IBV strain Mass-41, antigen-antibody complexing occurred at a pI of 6.8, and, for IBV strain Ark-99, at 7.2. No cross reaction of antisera was observed for either strain. Since tissue affinities are a function of the viral peplomer-mediated attachment of virus to cells and are often directly related to pathogenicity, it appears that altered pathogenicity of strains of IBV may be detected by alteration of pI of the proteins. Classification by pI of proteins of at least the smaller viruses allows untypeable, highly pathogenic or persistent strains of these viruses to be characterized on the basis of variant proteins.",1
"Three tests were compared to diagnose herpes virus infection: electron microscopy (EM), viral culture (VC) and cytodiagnosis (Tzanck smear). The study comprised 67 patients with skin or mucous membrane lesions suggestive of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. The sensitivity of EM increased 25% after virus concentration by ultracentrifugation. Herpes virus infection was confirmed in 55 of the 67 cases by EM or VC or both. EM detected 53 herpes virus-positive lesion samples of which 14 were not detected by VC; only two lesion samples that were herpes virus-positive in VC were not detected by EM. The sensitivities of EM, VC, and Tzanck smear for the group of 55 herpes virus-positive cases were 96%, 75% and 76%, respectively. The specificity of the Tzanck smear was 83% (prevalence 82%). Colloidal gold immuno-EM was used to rapidly type HSV-1, HSV-2 and varicella zoster virus (VZV) present in skin and mucous membrane lesions in less than 4 h. Immuno-EM was able to detect antiviral antibodies on viral envelopes and viral cores in lesion samples with negative VC. Antiviral antibodies do not interfere with typing of herpes viruses by immuno-EM. It is suggested that formation of viral immune complexes and inactivation of virus particles by antibodies may have caused a negative VC. Improved EM is discussed for its applicability to special cases that cannot rely on VC and cytodiagnosis or when rapid diagnosis is required.",1
"A sensitive and specific blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to distinguish infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBRV)-infected animals from those immunized with a glycoprotein gIII deletion mutant, IBRV(NG)dltkdlgIII. For this ELISA, undiluted test sera are used to block the binding of an anti-IBRV gIII monoclonal antibody (mAbgIII)-horseradish peroxidase (HRPO) conjugate to gIII antigen. TMB substrate is used for color development. Negative S/N values (defined as the absorbance at 650 nm of test sera/absorbance at 650 nm of negative control sera) of >0.80 were obtained with immune sera from gnotobiotic cattle immunized with several bovine viruses, with bovine antisera to bovine herpesvirus-2, and vesicular stomatitis virus, with porcine antisera to pseudorabies virus and parvovirus, and with normal sera from heterologous species. Negative S/N values were also obtained with sera from rabbits twice vaccinated with IBRV(NG)dltkdlgIII. However, the S/N values became positive (S/N <0.8) 10 to 17 days after the rabbits were challenge exposed to virulent IBRV(Cooper). Most of 116 sera (84%) from feedlot cattle with virus neutralization (VN) titers of < 1:2 or < 1:4 had negative S/N values >0.8, but 18 sera with negative VN titers had positive S/N values, consistent with observations indicating that an IBRV outbreak was occurring in one of the feedlot herds. Thirty nine sera (98%) from feedlot cattle with VN titers of 1:2 to 1:128 had positive S/N values (<0.8). One serum with a VN titer of 1:2 had a borderline (±) S/N value of 0.81. After immunization with a commercial gIII-positive IBRV vaccine, 115 116 sera with VN titers of 1:2 to 1:256 had positive S/N values (<0.8). One serum with a VN titer of 1:2 had a negative S/N value of 0.83. Serum from one vaccinated animal that failed to seroconvert after vaccination (VN < 1:4) showed a strongly positive ELISA S/N of 0.48.",1
"The aim of this study was to develop a polymerase chain reaction for specific detection of influenza A, B, and C RNA genomes. Three primer sets were selected from conserved regions of the genome coding for the non-structural proteins and were tested on 61 influenza A (22 H1N1, 9 H2N2, and 30 H3N2), 11 influenza B, and three influenza C isolates. Specific amplified products were obtained with all these strains after electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel. The specificity of the reaction was increased by hybridization with oligonucleotide probes. When nucleic acids from a variety of micro-organisms from the respiratory tract were subjected to the PCR with these primers, no specific amplified products were generated. The sensitivity of the technique was found to be at the subpicogram level. The RNA-PCR was applied to 21 clinical specimens from patients with a culture/IF proven influenza infection. Six influenza A positive patients and 13 influenza B positive patients could be confirmed in the RNA-PCR. In two cases, influenza B positive IF specimens were found negative by the PCR. No virus could be isolated on eggs or tissue culture from these samples. RNA-PCR is a specific and sensitive technique for the detection of influenza virus genomes.",1
"Three methods were evaluated for the detection of cherry leafroll virus: ELISA, dot-blot and reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Dot-blot and RT-PCR were carried out in crude plant extracts without any further RNA purification. Dot-blot hybridization using a 32P-labelled DNA probe was as sensitive as previously reported ELISA results for cherry leafroll virus detection. The most sensitive method was RT-PCR, which amplified a specific fragment of 448 bp from the 3' untranslated region of both viral genomic RNAs. RT-PCR was used to detect cherry leafroll virus in infected walnut buds and twigs.",1
"Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain JHM (MHV-JHM) is a neurotropic coronavirus that causes acute fatal encephalomyelitis in 75–99% of infected mice. The surviving animals may subsequently develop demyelinating disease. We compared the S peplomer protein of the wild type (wt) and five temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of MHV-JHM. In contrast with the wt, none of these five cause fatal disease (mortality less than 10%). Three of these ts mutants did not induce any demyelinating disease, a fourth caused demyelinating disease in 5% of the animals and a fifth, designated ts8, exhibited strong demyelinating properties and caused demyelination in 99% of the animals. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed no differences in the molecular weight of S peplomer protein of wt or ts MHV-JHM mutants. However, isoelectric focusing of the S protein of these five ts mutants and the wt MHV-JHM, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose sheets and immunoblotting with anti-S specific antibody revealed significant differences in the microheterogeneity of the S protein.",1
"Genomic RNA fingerprints of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains M41 and Conn46 were prepared to identify T1 RNase-resistant oligonucleotides ‘unique’ to each of the two IBV strains. Such oligonucleotides were subsequently eluted from the gels and their nucleotide sequences determined. When oligonucleotide probes of those sequences were synthesized and used in a dot-blot hybridization assay, the probes lacked IBV strain-specificity and reacted with the RNAs of homologous as well as heterologous IBV strains. Based on these results, the methods used in this study need to be applied to a large number of oligonucleotide probes, to find one or a few that might be suitable as IBV strain- or serotype-specific oligonucleotide probes.",1
"A method was developed for fast and efficient isolation of RNA from paraffin-embedded tissue sections for subsequent PCR analysis. This method is based on the binding of RNA to acid-treated glass beads in the presence of a high molarity of guanidinium salt. It can be completed within an hour, and obviates the need for dewaxing and phenol/chloroform extractions. The effect of various fixatives and fixation times was tested and the amplification of actin mRNA fragments ranging in length from 82 to 507 bp was used to demonstrate the presence of RNA in the extracts. The method was compared to existing extraction techniques by studying the quality of the templates for reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction amplification (RT-PCR), using virus-infected and mock-infected paraffin-embedded cell pellets as a model. PCR amplification of cellular and viral RNA was successful for RNA isolated by use of all extraction techniques, although the glass bead method was preferred for its simplicity and rapidity. Specimens fixed with formalin were found to be suitable for PCR, but the best results were obtained with acetone-fixed paraffin-embedded material. Dewaxing of tissue sections had no effect on the yield and quality of RNA extractions, and further purification of the extracts using gel filtration did not improve the results. After the protocols were optimized, rotavirus-infected cell pellets were used to demonstrate that extraction and amplification of dsRNA was possible. The information obtained from the studies with the model system was used for extraction of toroviral and rotaviral RNA from archival intestinal material. These data indicate that paraffin-embedded archival tissue can be used for RT-PCR analysis, adding an important technique to diagnostic pathology and retrospective studies.",1
"Plaque assays under Sephadex or agarose overlays are described for rat coronaviruses (RCVs) grown in L2 mouse fibroblasts. A plaque assay using Sephadex was simple; however, viable plaques could not be collected for propagation, and fixation was necessary before evaluation. Plaque formation under agarose was optimized using diethylaminoethyl-dextran (DEAE-D) in the pre-treatment and absorption media and trypsin added to the absorption media and agarose overlay. The use of DEAE-D alone, trypsin alone or trypsin combined with DEAE-D significantly increased plaque numbers and visibility. Plaque numbers were highest when pre-treatment media contained DEAE-D, absorption media contained DEAE-D and trypsin, and the agarose overlay contained trypsin. The assay was useful for plaque isolation and quantification of sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDA), Parker's rat coronavirus (PRCV) and other coronavirus isolates from rats and its specificity was demonstrated by plaque-reduction neutralization testing. These methods will facilitate production of cloned virus stocks for study of RCV biology and virus quantification for in vitro and in vivo studies of RCVs.",1
"A data base for a large diagnostic virology laboratory is described. The system uses a network of personal computers. It allows the entry, long-term storage, and subsequent retrieval of specimen and patient records (comprising personal identifiers and specimen and result information), and hard-copy results reporting. Sited entirely within the laboratory, the network is not connected to a modem. Within the laboratory there is restricted access to human immunodeficiency virus test results to guarantee patient confidentiality. Retention of a hard-copy of specimen request cards ensures the availability of the original clinical information. The data base is copied on a second file server to facilitate searches, and daily streaming onto magnetic tape provides system protection in the event of hard disc failure. Matching of old and new patient records is done by surname, date of birth, and sex, and therefore duplicate records accumulate when patient names are misspelt on specimen request forms. The system requires further development to speed searches of the data base and to achieve automatic generation of laboratory worksheets. Future goals are the replacement of hard-copy records of clinical information and hard-copy reporting with on-line access to hospital data bases and on-line requesting by and reporting to the clinician.",1
"In order to provide an easy and powerful analysis of influenza C viral HEF RNA segment of a recent strain, a combination of reverse transcription and the polymerase chain reaction was used. We amplified the entire coding region of the HEF gene of a laboratory strain of virus called C/Johannesburg/1/66, widely used for binding and esterase activity studies as well as that of a strain isolated in 1991 (C/Paris/145/91) from a patient suffering from severe flu syndrome. The sequences we amplified were about 2 kilobases long. In this work, we show that the forward ‘universal primer’ Unil, which has been used for influenza A and B viruses cDNA syntheses can also be used for influenza C virus. The PCR primers were designed to contain restriction sites to make the PCR products ready to be used for further purposes. A restriction analysis of the PCR products combined with analyses of all the human influenza C virus HEF gene sequences published so far permitted the design of sets of oligonucleotides which can prime PCR on cDNA of unknown influenza C virus for cloning.",1
"The effects of centrifugation on the ability of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) to infect cells in culture was investigated. The infectivity titer was the highest when the plates were centrifuged at 400 × g (1500 rpm) for 2 h. All five strains classified as FIPV Type I showed infectivity titers enhanced 10–100-fold by centrifugation at 400 × g for 2 h. The centrifugal enhancement of infection was obtained only by centrifugation immediately after inoculation of the virus, suggesting that the enhancement occurs during attachment or adsorption of viruses to the cells. This method may be useful for the culture of FIPV Type I strains.",1
"A blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting antibodies to the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) in pig sera was developed and compared with the immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA), the most widely used serological diagnostic test in Europe. The blocking ELISA was specific and more sensitive than the IPMA when applied to field sera and to sera which were collected early after an experimental infection with PRRSV. Problems with high background activity as observed in IPMA or indirect ELISA were not encountered.",1
"Enterotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strains have been difficult to grow in cell culture. In an attempt to develop an efficient in vitro cultivation system for enterotropic MHV strains (MHV-RI and MHV-Y), 8 murine cell lines were inoculated with MHV-RI- or MHV-Y-infected infant mouse intestinal homogenates and screened for the production of cytopathic effects. MHV-RI and MHV-Y consistently produced cytopathic effects only in J774A.1 cells. Both strains produced titers of 106 TCID50/ml in subsequent passages in J774.1 cells. MHV strains -1, -3, -A59, -JHM, -S and -DVIM also produced high-titer viral stocks in J774A.1 cells. Therefore J774A.1 cells are the first cells found that support the replication of these 8 enterotropic and respiratory MHV strains. After passage in J774A.1 cells, MHV-RI and MHV-Y could infect previously non-susceptible cell lines (17C1-1, CMT-93, N18 and NCTC 1469), though cytopathic effects were often negligible with MHV-RI. MHV-Y, but not MHV-RI, grew in L2(Percy) cells. Using L2(Percy) cells, an agarose overlay and Giemsa staining, MHV-Y could be quantified by plaque assay. Infant mouse bioassays, plaque assays and cell culture infections were compared for their sensitivity in detecting MHV-Y in infected intestinal homogenates and cell supernatants.",1
"Infection of cell monolayers by murine coronavirus A59 at pH 6 rather than 7 yielded a ten-fold increase in the infectious titer and a remarkable enhancement of the reactivities of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against the spike glycoprotein in immunoblotting, immuno-precipitation and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. These observations are very useful for detecting antibodies against the S glycoprotein of coronaviruses and enhancing infectious titers.",1
"A recombinant glutathione-S-transferase fusion protein expressing amino acids 55–98 of equine arteritis virus (EAV) GL (rGL55–98) was tested in an ELISA for its ability to detect serum antibodies to EAV. Host antibodies induced following EAV infection bound the recombinant antigen by ELISA. The ELISA specificity and sensitivity were determined with a panel of equine sera including postinfection and postvaccination samples. A good correlation existed between EAV neutralizing antibody titers and ELISA absorbance values (r = 0.827). The sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA were 99.6 and 90.1%, respectively, compared with the EAV neutralization test and the recombinant antigen did not crossreact in ELISA with equine sera directed against other common equine respiratory viruses. Three post-EAV infection equine sera raised against different EAV isolates reacted strongly in the ELISA, as did two equine sera raised against EAV vaccines, indicating that the viral epitope was conserved between the viruses tested. Following vaccination with an inactivated whole virus vaccine, antibody detected with the recombinant antigen ELISA preceded the development of a virus-neutralizing response. The study demonstrates the potential application of rGL55–98 as a diagnostic antigen.",1
"Human coronaviruses are known to be a common cause of respiratory infections in man. However, the diagnosis of human coronavirus infections is not carried out routinely, primarily because the isolation and propagation of these viruses in tissue culture is difficult and time consuming. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of recombinant, bacterial expressed proteins in the serodiagnosis of coronavirus infections. Two proteins were examined: the human coronavirus 229E nucleocapsid protein (N), expressed as a fusion protein in the vector pUR and the coronavirus 229E surface glycoprotein (S), expressed as a fusion protein in the vector pROS. The recombinant proteins were used as antigens in Western blot (WB) assays to detect the 229E-specific IgG antibodies and the results were compared with a standard serological method, indirect immunofluorescence. Serum samples of 51 paediatric patients, suffering from acute respiratory illness, and 10 adults, voluntarily infected with human coronavirus, were tested. The serum samples of the adult group had coronavirus-specific IgG antibodies in both test systems. In contrast, only 8 51 sera of the paediatric group were positive for coronavirus-specific IgG by both WB and IF and 20 51 sera were positive by WB, but not by IF. The overall incidence of human coronavirus infections in the paediatric age group was 55% evaluated by WB analysis and 16% evaluated by IF. This study shows that recombinant human coronavirus 229E proteins are suitable reagents for the epidemiological screening of coronavirus 229E infections.",1
"The in situ hybridization (ISH) technique was developed to detect the swine coronaviruses, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), in cell culture and tissue sections from TGEV-or PRCV-infected pigs. The 35S-labeled RNA probes were generated from two plasmids pPSP.FP1 and pPSP.FP2 containing part of the S gene of TGEV. The procedure was first standardized in cell cultures. The radiolabeled pPSP.FP2 probe detected both TGEV and PRCV in virus-inoculated cell cultures, whereas pPSP.FP1 probe detected TGEV but not PRCV. The probe was then used to detect TGEV or PRCV in tissues of pigs experimentally infected with TGEV or PRCV or naturally infected with TGEV. Again, the probes detected TGEV in intestines of experimentally and naturally infected pigs and PRCV in the lungs of experimentally infected pigs. TGEV RNA was detected mainly within the enterocytes at the tips of villi and, less often, within some crypt epithelial cells. PRCV was shown to replicate mainly in the bronchiolar epithelial cells and in lesser amount in type II pneumocytes, type I pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells, respectively. ISH has potential applications as a diagnostic test for the detection and differentiation of TGEV and PRCV in tissues and in studies to gain a better understanding of the mechanism of pathogenesis of enteric and respiratory coronavirus infections.",1
"The affinity of a panel of neutralizing monoclonal IgGs and their Fab fragments has been measured for the first time with an enveloped type A influenza virus, by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and the BIAlite™ instrument. Equilibrium constants could be calculated for four of the five mAbs tested. These were in the nanomolar range. The ranking order was very similar to that obtained with an affinity ELISA, (an equilibrium system) but as others have found, affinities were 2–10-fold lower as measured by SPR (a flow system). No data were obtained with mAb HC58 although it had one of the highest affinities using an ELISA format, and was 28-fold higher than another mAb (HC10) which gave good data by SPR. This may relate to the orientation of its binding on the virion surface. The K dissoc. of the Fabs was only 3–10-fold higher compared to their IgGs. Fab from the lowest affinity IgG (HC10) could not be measured, possibly because it fell below the threshold for detection.",1
"In the previous article in this series, we focused on how the interaction between viral cell attachment proteins and receptor molecules on the surface of host target cells played a major role in determining the cell and tissue tropism of many neurotropic viruses. In order to complete our review of viral factors that influence the tropism of viruses for the CNS, we will discuss the role of viral genes that function to specifically enhance the replication of viral proteins in certain cells or tissues (“tissue-specific enhancers and promoters”). We will then examine the ways in which host factors, including specific host genes, can influence resistance or susceptibility to certain types of neurotropic viral infections. Finally, we will conclude by reviewing how factors that involve the interaction of the host and the virus, such as the site of the viral entry and its route and method of spread, can influence the distribution of viral infection within the CNS.",1
"An immunogenic component was isolated from both the Illinois (propagated in young swine) and the Miller (cell culture-adapted) strains of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus. The viral subunit was released from the virion by sonication and was separated from intact virus and other viral components by isopycnic centrifugation. It had a buoyant density in sucrose of 1.02 g/ml. Further purification consisted of gel filtration through Sephadex G200, in which process the immunogen, with a molecular weight of approximately 25 000, was the last component to be eluted. A group of ten young, weaned swine, inoculated intramuscularly with two or three 1-mg doses of the viral subunit were protected against challenge with virulent TGE virus, probably by the induction of secretory IgA. The immunogen also induced a humoral immune response of variable magnitude (titers ranging from 8 to 5 625) in the animals. These antibodies are not believed to be directly related to protection against infection. They can, however, be easily identified by serologic procedures and may serve as a convenient indicator of responsiveness to the TGE viral immunogen.",1
"Before the prophylactic effect of human interferon α 2 (HuIFN-α 2) can be tested against naturally acquired rhinovirus infection in a large-scale field trial, it is desirable to show that self-administration of the drug is practical, and to determine the smallest well-tolerated dose likely to produce a worthwhile effect. Here we report that self-administered intranasal interferon can be effective, and show how prophylaxis against rhinovirus infection is affected by both the quantity of interferon, and the interval between a dose and virus challenge. Finally, the medication regimen suggested for use in field trials (3.85 MU 3 times/day) was tested in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in volunteers. Although virus challenge was at a time when those being treated with interferon would be most susceptible, a substantial protective effect was still demonstrated.",1
"Population density and immune status, vectors and virulence of infection, nutritional status, sanitation, genetic susceptibility and medical management of cases, are important factors influencing the incidence and/or severity of virus infections. Thus, the prevalence and clinical importance of virus infections and the need for antiviral drugs differ from place to place and from time to time. National and World Health Statistics of notifications of disease give some index of the incidence of infections but not all virus infections are notifiable. Such statistics can be misleading also through failures to notify from sloth on the part of the physician or, in the absence of pathognomonic symptoms or signs, from errors in diagnosis. Any assessment of the need for new antiviral drugs should consider the availability, safety, effectiveness and cost of alternative measures, including prevention of spread of infection by control of vectors, immunization by use of viral vaccines, or treatment with existing antiviral drugs. Early start of treatment of acute virus infections with existing drugs gives the best results and, where the clinical diagnosis is uncertain, accurate rapid virus diagnosis is of paramount importance. Many virus infections are asymptomatic or of trivial importance and without sequelae. However, new or improved antiviral drugs are needed for the prevention and/or treatment of a number of significant conditions caused by viruses which are not at present adequately controlled. These include upper and lower respiratory tract infections, influenza, chronic hepatitis, gastroenteritis, infectious mononucleosis, measles, rabies, haemorrhagic fevers and warts. Furthermore, such drugs might prove of therapeutic value in the prevention or treatment of virus-associated tumours, such as hepatoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, Kaposi's sarcoma and possibly carcinoma of the cervix.",1
"The influence of different antiproteinase agents on alphavirus replication was examined. Sindbis virus multicycle replication in cultured cells was suppressed by N-tosyl-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK), an inhibitor of chymotrypsin-like proteinases, and by aprotinin, an inhibitor of a wide spectrum of proteinases. Antiviral activity of TPCK was also demonstrated in Sindbis virus-infected animals. Parenteral injections of TPCK in infected mice reduced virus titers in brain and blood. The possible mechanism(s) of antiviral action of the antiproteinase agents are discussed.",1
"Investigations of the production and potential use of bovine interferons against viral infections have occurred since the first descriptions of interferons in other systems. The recent advent of recombinant DNA-technology has facilitated such studies and furthered our knowledge about the bovine interferon system in general. This review gives an overview of the biology, antiviral and immunomodulatory activities of bovine interferons. Areas in which the interferons are now applied or have potential application in viral diseases in cattle are described. Finally, the value of studies of the bovine interferon system with respect to comparative interferon research is discussed.",1
"Many plants contain polyhydroxyalkaloids which are potent inhibitors of glucosidases, enzymes involved in oligosaccharide trimming. These are important in determining the final configuration of specific glycoproteins. Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) encodes a number of glycoproteins, some of which ultimately reside in the outer envelope of the mature virion and are important for virus infectivity. Treatment with three polyhydroxyalkaloids, castanospermine (CAST), deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) and 2R,5R-dihydroxymethyl-3R, 4R-dihydroxypyrrolidine (DMDP) blocked the growth of infectious virus, as determined by yield reduction and plaque reduction assays. However, in the presence of CAST, CMV infected cells continued to shed virions into the extracellular medium, as determined by electron microscopy. Envelope glycoproteins of virions produced after treatment with CAST (2.5 mM) were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody (F5) specific for the gcI family of glycoproteins. Analysis by PAGE-SDS showed an absence of gcI complex 2 (gp52 disulphide-linked to gp130) with a proportional increase in gcI complex 1 (gp52 disulphide-linked to gp95). The results indicated that gp130 alone, or linked to gp52, was important for CMV infectivity. As well as being potential targets for antiviral agents against CMV, inhibitors of glycoprotein trimming reactions may define components of the virion surface important for infectivity.",1
"The purpose of this study was to probe the antirhinovirus (RV) mechanism of action of MDL 20,610. Evaluation of the compound's effects on RV RNA synthesis, uncoating of neutral red-sensitized RV, plasma membrane penetration by RV, stabilization of RV against heat (56°C) and low pH (5.0) inactivation, and studies with MDL 20,610-resistant RV mutants indicate that MDL 20,610 binds directly to the RV capsid with subsequent inhibition of acid-mediated virion uncoating.",1
"In a double-blind placebo controlled trial intranasal NPC 567, a bradykinin antagonist, failed to alleviate the symptoms of experimental rhinovirus colds. Indeed, there was evidence that the drug enhanced the symptoms although no irritant effect was detected on the uninfected nasal mucosa.",1
"In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, self-administered intranasal interferonα-2a or placebo was given both before and after challenge with respiratory syncytial virus. The incidence of colds and the severity of signs and symptoms were reduced in those receiving interferonα-2a as compared with those given placebo. In a further double-blind, placebo-controlled study, self-administered interferonα-2a or placebo was given only to those volunteers who developed colds following challenge with respiratory syncytial virus. There was no evidence that interferonα-2a reduced the severity of the signs and symptoms or shortened the duration of the illness. The similarity of these results to the effect of interferonα-2a in rhinovirus infections in volunteers is discussed.",1
"The biological response modifier 7-thia-8-oxoguanosine was evaluated in mice against the hepatotropic Adames strain of Punta Toro virus. When administered intraperitoneally in divided doses, significant protection from death was conferred at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day given 24 and 17 h pre-virus inoculation, 25–100 mg/kg/day administered 4 h pre- and 3 h post-virus challenge, and 12.5 to 100 mg/kg/day administered 24 and 31 h after virus inoculation. These doses preventing death reduced liver icterus scores, serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, and liver and serum virus titers relative to placebo controls. Full daily doses administered at 24 h were somewhat less protective to mice than divided daily doses starting at the same time. The initiation of treatment could be delayed as late as 36 h after virus inoculation, resulting in complete protection from mortality at 100 mg/kg/day. This prevention of death occurred despite the acute nature of the infection which resulted in deaths by 96 h in the placebo-treated controls. These results show that 7-thia-8-oxoguanosine has both prophylactic and therapeutic potential as an anti-Phlebovirus agent. Interferon induction appears to be the reason for antiviral activity in this model, since up to 10000 units of interferon/ml were induced in mice 1 h after treatment with 100 mg 7-thia-8-oxoguanosine per kg, and antibody to interferon α/β administered shortly after treatment with the nucleoside negated the antiviral effect.",1
"I have been asked to stand back and describe in broad terms the view I have had of common colds — probably the most frequent of acute human diseases and a long-lasting scientific problem — and in particular our recent work on antivirals. I should be able to do this for two reasons. Like everyone else I have suffered from colds, but in addition I have been studying the problem from the virological and clinical point of view for over 35 years — for the last 31 at the Common Cold Unit, Salisbury. As a result I may have problems with perspective — it is not possible to give a personal view and at the same time to describe something from every possible angle, and quite impossible to be comprehensive, but I have done my best and readers will make their own judgements and corrections.",1
"Mucosal resistance to infection with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) has been previously demonstrated, and the LDV system presents an important murine model for the study of mucosal barriers to viral infection. In the present study, duodenal molecules were isolated from normal mice which had potent virucidal activity, when tested against LDV as well as canine herpes, canine hepatitis, Semliki forest, and visna viruses. The virucidal activity was demonstrated to be non-immune in nature, and was present in apparently non-enzymatic protein molecules, having a molecular mass of between 10–100 kDa by membrane filtration and 10–17 kDa by gel filtration. The anti-LDV activity of these molecules was suppressed by anti-duodenum antibodies in vitro, and in vivo studies suggested a possible protective role for the anti-viral molecules. We conclude that the normal mouse duodenum contains potent virucidal molecules, which are of interest to the study of biological and molecular mechanisms of viral resistance.",1
"A novel nucleoside analog, 8-chloro-7-deazaguanosine (8-Cl-7-dzGuo), was evaluated for anti-RNA virus activity in rodents in parallel with the related compound 7-deaza-7-thia-8-oxoguanosine (7-dzTOGuo). Half-daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) doses of each substance administered 24 and 18 h prior to i.p. virus challenge protected the majority of mice infected with banzi, encephalomyocarditis, San Angelo, and Semliki Forest viruses at doses of 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg/day. These compounds at 100 mg/kg/day also protected most suckling rats infected intranasally with rat coronavirus. However, no survival benefit was afforded to treated mice infected intranasally with vesicular stomatitis virus. 8-Cl-7-dzguo was orally active against Semliki Forest virus in mice at 200 and 400 mg/kg/day, whereas 7-dzTOGuo is reported to not be effective orally. In uninfected mice, the two compounds induced similar amounts of interferon following i.p. injections. Interferon was induced by oral treatments with 8-Cl-7-dzGuo but not with 7-dzTOGuo. Fifty percent acute lethal doses to uninfected mice treated i.p. in half-daily doses for one day with 7-deazaguanosine (7-dzGuo), 7-dzTOGuo, and 8-Cl-7-dzGuo were 400, 600 and > 1600 (no mortality at this dose) mg/kg/day, respectively. Daily, i.p. treatments for 14 days with these substances (100 mg/kg/day) showed 7-dzGuo as 100% lethal and the other two substances at not toxic. By virtue of reduced toxicity and oral bioavailability, 8-Cl-7-dzGuo appears to have the greatest clinical potential as an interferon-inducing antiviral agent.",1
"Antiviral activities of four Schiff bases of aminohydroxyguanidine, designated ML1, ML4, ATL14 and LK11, were tested against human adenovirus types 5 and 8 (Ad5 and Ad8) in A549 cells by plaque reduction and virus yield reduction methods. Compound ML1 1-(2′-hydroxy-5′-methoxybenzylidene)amino-3-hydroxyguanidine tosylate gave the best therapeutic indices (TC50/IC50) of 27.2 and 17.8 for Ad5 and Ad8, respectively. Pretreatment of cells with ML1 did not affect the adsorption nor the penetration of virus. Ultrastructure studies showed that only the drug treated infected cells had unidentified irregular shaped electron dense structures that might be drug altered viral macromolecules that were not assembled into complete infectious virus particles. Since these compounds have metal chelating properties, their antiviral activity may involve the early IA (EIA) gene which encodes a viral protein of 289 amino acid which has a zinc finger moiety that is required for its transactivation activity.",1
"The effect of liposome-encapsulation on the immunomodulating and antiviral activities of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) was evaluated in this study. The immunomodulating activity was measured by increases in phagocytic activity and in nitric oxide production by peritoneal macrophages from mice treated with both free and LIP-IFN-γ (4000 U/mouse, intraperitoneal injection). Resident peritoneal macrophages harvested from mice treated with free unencapsulated IFN-γ or muramyl dipeptide showed significant increases in macrophage yield, and enhanced ability to phagocytize zymosan particles. In mice treated with liposome-encapsulated IFN-γ (LIP-IFN-γ), both macrophage yield and phagocytic activity further increased by 2-fold over unencapsulated IFN-γ. In addition, the activation of peritoneal macrophages with LIP-IFN-γ showed enhanced production of NO when the cells were cultured ex vivo. Using a murine respiratory influenza infection model, intranasally administered LIP-IFN-γ conferred protection to 70% in mice challenged intranasally with 10 LD50 doses of influenza A/PR/8 virus compared with a 20% survival rate using free IFN-γ. Together these results suggest that liposome-encapsulation increases the immunomodulating and antiviral activities of IFN-γ. Liposome-encapsulation of IFN-γ may provide additional therapeutic advantages by reducing IFN-γ toxicity while prolonging its body retention.",1
"Using an RNA footprinting technique, accessible sites on the mRNA initiation region bound to the ribosome have been determined. Chemical probing experiments have been done both in the presence and absence of the initiator tRNA with dimethyl sulfate, kethoxal and carbodiimide as reagent probes. As an mRNA, a mini-mRNA containing the initiation region of bacteriophage λ gene cro has been used. This region is characterized by a long single-stranded Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence followed by two hairpin structures of which the first one comprises in its loop the initiation codon. As compared to a free mRNA, the only nucleotides additionally protected in the binary mRNA-ribosome complex have been those which belong to the S-D sequence and the initiation codon. The protection of other nucleotides has not changed. Addition of the initiator RNA results in the modification of nucleotides in the stems of the downstream hairpin structures of the initiation region. This reflects their transition into a single-stranded conformation promoted by tRNA. A possible implication of these findings for the decoding process is discussed.",1
"Tuna pyloric caeca aminopeptidase (tAP) is a glycosylated zinc-metalloenzyme containing apparently two identical subunits. The enzyme is reversibly inhibited in a time-dependent manner by amastatin. Slow development of tAP inhibition by this inhibitor could be demonstrated. Dissociation of the complex of tAP with amastatin is also slow. Two molar equivalents of the inhibitor are bound by the enzyme suggesting the presence of one catalytic site in each subunit. Chemical modification of tAP with 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbonyl-metho-p-toluene sulfonate and N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinone revealed the presence of essential acidic amino acid residues probably located at the active site. Compatible with the presence of arginine and tyrosine residues at the catalytic site of most metalloproteinases, tAP is reversibly inhibited by phenylglyoxal and inactivated by tetranitromethane in a time-dependent fashion. The rate of inhibition by these modifiers could be significantly decreased if the enzyme was previously treated with amastatin suggesting that the modified amino acid residues are located at the catalytic site. Diethylpyrocarbonate did not affect the activity of both native and zinc-depleted tAP suggesting that histidine is not involved in the zinc-ligand formation.",1
"Experimentally induced demyelination has an autoimmune origin in some mouse models and is somehow virally induced in others. In June, invited participants in a Kroc Foundation workshop discussed the damaging mechanisms involved and their relevance to an understanding of multiple sclerosis and human encephalomyelitis.",1
Three groups of investigators came together to learn from each other in a workshop: neurologists and neuropathologists interested in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and other demyelinative diseases of man and similar autoimmune and virus-induced model diseases in animals; immunologists and virologists concerned with the genetic controls found to play a role in these diseases; and geneticists and molecular biologists investigating specific gene products and their role in recognition function and cell interactions in model immunological systems.,1
"Many aspects of viral immunity, ranging from the molecular and cellular studies of the interaction between viruses and host cells in vitro and the crystalline structures of the MHC and peptides, to the regulation of pathogenesis in experimental animals and humans were discussed at a recent meeting.",1
"Epidemiologic methods were applied in an investigation into causes of neonatal mortality on a 1400-cow dairy in the southern San Joaquin Valley of California. A format for collation of information on birthdate and date of death was assembled into a matrix which improved conceptualization of the data and which simplified procedures for estimation of mortality rates. Contemporary and birth cohort life table methods, mortality density estimations and relative risk assessment were used to ascertain if there were high-risk groups of calves that could be identified by age, day-of-the-week born, day-of-the-week died and sex. During the outbreak of neonatal diarrhea on this dairy, female calves were found to have experienced an atypically higher rate of mortality (10.7%) than did males (5.3%). Calves of both sexes died between the ages of 9 and 19 days. In addition, the risk of dying was 11 times greater for calves born on Wednesdays than for those born on Saturdays. These findings formed the basis for recommended changes in management of neonatal calves on the dairy.",1
"Heifer calf management practices and clinical outcomes were studied on 104 randomly selected Holstein dairy farms in southwestern Ontario between October 1980 and July 1983. Data were collected at both the farm level (all farms) and the individual calf level (1968 calves, 35 farms). Farm-level management data were collected by means of questionnaires and farm visits. Calf-level management data were recorded by farmers on forms provided. Treatments for disease and mortality data were recorded by the farmers on the calves up to the age of weaning, the age at which calves were no longer fed milk or milk substitutes on a regular basis. Farm size ranged from 23 to 154 calvings per year. Farm-level mortality rates per six-month season (winter/summer) were skewed, with a mean of about 6%, a median of zero, and a range of 67%. Morbidity rates were similarly skewed. Four percent of liveborn heifer calves died, 20% were treated for scours, and 15% were treated for pneumonia before the age of weaning. Stated farm policies on calf rearing were implemented to varying degrees on different farms, as estimated from individual calf data. This posed particular problems for interpreting farm-level data, since the danger of committing an ecologic fallacy was high. The data set described in this paper formed the basis for an observational study of the interlationships of heifer calf management and clinical outcomes.",1
"Associations between heifer calf management and morbidity, particularly scours and pneumonia, were studied on 104 randomly selected Holstein dairy farms in southwestern Ontario between October 1980 and July 1983. At the farm level, data were stratified by season, with two six-month seasons (winter and summer) per year. The odds of farms with particular management strategies having above median morbidity were calculated. At the individual calf level, the odds of a calf being treated, controlling for farm of origin and month of birth, were calculated for different management practices. Farm size, and policies related to anti-scour vaccination, offering free-choice water and minerals to calves, methods of feeding, and the use of medicated feeds significantly altered the odds of a farm experiencing above-median pneumonia rates. Farm policies with regard to anti-scour vaccination, offering free-choice salt to calves, age at teat removal, type of calf housing, and use of preventive antimicrobials significantly altered the odds of a farm experiencing above-median scours rates. Scours and pneumonia were significantly associated with each other at both the farm and the calf level. No significant associations were found between individual calf management practices and the odds of being treated for scours. Sire used, method of first colostrum feeding, navel treatment, use of anti-scour vaccine in the dam, and the administration of preventive antimicrobials significantly altered the odds of a calf being treated for pneumonia.",1
"Associations between heifer calf management and mortality were studied on 104 randomly selected Holstein dairy farms in southwestern Ontario between October 1980 and July 1983. At the farm level, data were stratified by season, with two six-month seasons (winter and summer) per year. The odds of farms with particular management strategies having above-median morbidity were calculated. At the individual calf level, the odds of a calf being treated, controlling for farm of origin and month of birth, were calculated for different management practices. Larger farms had significantly greater odds of experiencing mortality than smaller farms in both winter and summer. Farms which had policies of attending calvings and ensuring that calves received their first colostrum had significantly lower odds of experiencing winter mortality than farms which did not have these policies. Farms which housed calves in hutches had significantly lower odds, and those which housed calves in group pens had significantly higher odds, of experiencing summer mortality, than farms which used individual indoor calf-pens. A policy of teat removal between four weeks of age and weaning was associated with increased odds of summer mortality. At the individual calf level, calving ease, sire, navel treatment, assistance at first colostrum feeding, administration of vitamins A, D and E and anti-scour vaccines to the pregnant dam, and place of calving, were all associated with significantly altered odds of dying. However, several interactions entered the statistical models, and the effects of those management practices were not all straightforward.",1
"The occurrence and distribution of certain enteropathogenic organisms and the manifestation of diarrhea, especially in relation to colostral management, were studied in neonatal calves of eight southern Finnish dairy herds with recurrent outbreaks of enteric disturbances. The fecal samples were obtained from the calves and were provided by the farmers. Potentially pathogenic agents were demonstrated in 52 of the 68 calves studied. Cryptosporidium was found in 36 of them while rotavirus was found in 29 and Escherichia coli in 15 of them, either singly or in combination. Salmonella, coronavirus or parvovirus were not detected in any of the calves. Twenty-six of the 36 calves contracted their Cryptosporidium infection and 18 of the 29 calves their rotavirus infection within the first week of life. Eighteen of the 52 infected calves developed diarrhea of microbial origin within 20 days of age; the most frequent finding was mixed infection with Cryptosporidium and rotavirus. In addition there were six diarrheic calves where no infection could be demonstrated. Only 10 of the 68 calves had neither infections nor diarrhea. There was a highly significant difference between the mean times of the first colostral feeding of the uninfected non-diarrheic and diarrheic calves and a significant difference between the mean times of the first colostral feeding of the subclinically infected and diarrheic calves. The importance of sucking of colostrum at the first feeding was observed. The smallest amount protecting the calves from infections was 0.75 1 given within 1 h of delivery.",1
"Rotavirus, K99+ E. coli and coccidia were identified from feces of 10%, 13% and 37% of 300 selected dairy calves ⩽3 months of age, and from 26%, 36% and 45% of 42 Costa Rican dairy farms, respectively. Calf breeds were Holstein 68%, Jersey 27% and other breeds 5%. Median calf ages at identification of rotavirus, K99+ E. coli and coccidia were 14.5, 15, and 3 days, respectively. Differences between isolation rates for the wet and dry season were not statistically significant for any of the three agents. Prevalence of antibodies against infectious bovine rhinotracheitis and bovine parainfluenza-3 virus were 7% and 82%, respectively, for selected calves. Of calf sera tested for immunoglobulins, 9.5% were negative.",1
"A liquid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was compared with the standard agar gel immunodiffusion test (AGID) to identify and quantify antibodies against foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus infection-associated (VIA) antigen. A total of 3181 cattle sera were tested. Of these sera, 1885 were from cattle which had not been exposed to FMD. A total of 1296 sera were either from cattle which were experimentally exposed to FMD virus or from cattle involved in field outbreaks. The results indicate that the ELISA has the same specificity as the AGID test, but is more efficient in detecting cattle exposed to FMD virus. The ELISA technique will probably prove to be a more satisfactory test in support of the prevention, control and eradication programs for the disease.",1
"The seroprevalence of porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) among breeding sows was estimated in Castilla y León, the largest region in Spain, by a cross-sectional study. Serum samples (1247) were taken from sows from 58 different herds for this purpose throughout 1988 and were tested by a monoclonal antibody-capture ELISA (MACELISA), a test which detects antibodies to both transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and PRCV. In order to discriminate positive sera to both coronaviruses, a blocking inhibition ELISA was used for all MACELISA-positive sera. By MACELISA, 31.4% of sera tested were positive and all of them were confirmed specifically as PRCV-positive by blocking inhibition ELISA, thus ruling out the presence of TGEV in the sampled area: 64% of the farms had at least one PRCV-seropositive sow, indicating that the infection was widespread Farms were classified into three categories, according to size and management practices. No significant differences were found in the prevalence rates among the three farm types; there was, however, a highly significant correlation between increasing farm size and increasing within-farm seropositivity.",1
"Veal calf hemorrhagic enteritis, a condition that has no identified specific etiology, is a fatal syndrome of veal calves and has recently become a major concern of the veal calf industry in the midwestern United States. To determine the possible role of common enteric pathogens in this disease, 40 veal calves with hemorrhagic enteritis (cases) and 25 dairy calves diagnosed with enteric infection (control) were investigated. The veal calves were negative for several known enteric pathogens except for pathogenic Escherichia coli isolates that expressed multiple virulence attributes. To determine whether such isolates have a significant association with hemorrhagic enteritis in veal calves, we compared the prevalence of pathogenic E. coli in the 40 veal calves with the prevalence of similar E. coli in the dairy calves that were diagnosed with colibacillosis within the same season of the year. Escherichia coli isolates from the two groups of calves were tested for several properties of E. coli related to pathogenicity, i.e. production of verotoxins, heat-stable enterotoxin (STa), heat-labile enterotoxin, enterohemolysin, K99 fimbrial antigens, hemagglutination activity, and attachment to Hep-2 tissue culture cells. Escherichia coli that produces STa were more commonly isolated from veal calves with hemorrhagic enteritis (45%) than from dairy calves with enteritis (12%) (P<0.05). Various patterns of attachment of E. coli to Hep-2 tissue culture cells were studied. The E. coli that demonstrated aggregative patterns of attachment were more commonly represented in veal calves (32%) than in dairy calves (8%). We observed that there was no correlation between STa production and K99 pili expression among the enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) isolates that were recovered from veal calves. This may indicate the emergence of K99-negative ETEC, probably as a result of the wide use of K99-based vaccines.",1
"A cross-sectional study for determining the seroprevalence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection among swine breeding farms in the Castilla y León region (Spain) was carried out. Breeding farms were stratified according to size and type of production (intensive or extensive). The number of farms to be sampled in each stratum was calculated from the latest census data available and the prevalence of seropositive farms obtained in other countries. Within each herd, the number of sows needed to detect the presence of the disease were sampled, according to within-herd seroprevalence data obtained by us in previous studies. A total of 5098 sow serum samples from 794 different farms were collected during 1992–1993 and tested for the presence of PEDV-specific antibodies, using a blocking ELISA with monoclonal antibodies; 55.9% of herds had at least one positive animal; 29.6% of sera were positive. Seropositive farms were detected throughout the sampled region, indicating that the infection was widespread. Higher farm-level prevalence rates were found in farms with more than 20 sows compared with small ones (≤ 20 sows) and in intensive than in extensive herds. On the other hand, within-farm seroprevalence and mean blocking percentage of positive sera decreased with increasing size of the farm.",1
"A retrospective study of sera from seven commercial pig herds was conducted from May 1985 to July 1989, showing that antibodies against Porcine Respiratory Coronavirus (PRCV) were first detected in Spain in September 1986. During 1991 a stratified sampling of breeding herds was conducted to establish prevalence to PRCV or Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV) infections in Catalunya (northeast Spain). An antibody-capture ELISA was used for PRCV- and/or TGEV-antibodies, while a competitive inhibition ELISA tested for TGEV-specific antibodies. This study revealed 91.1% positive sera and 96.7% positive farms to PRCV and/or TGEV with a gradual increase in prevalence during 1991, which was more noticeable in small herds. Of the total 569 herds tested, 65.2% were positive only to PRCV, 8.6% were positive to TGEV and 22.8% had mixed infections. The first appearance of antibodies coincided with large importation of feeder pigs from Belgium and Holland. This prevalence is much higher than previously reported in other regions of Spain.",1
"The prevalence and geographical distribution of some economically important swine diseases were surveyed in 114 randomly selected farrowing units which had a contract with Southwestern Finland's Cooperative Slaughterhouse (LSO) for producing feeder pigs to be delivered to the all in-all out finishing units. The focus was on infectious diseases which could be transmitted to the finishing units with delivered growers, and which might have some influence on partial carcass condemnations (PCC) in meat inspection. Farm visits were done by a veterinarian (senior author) assisted by a technician. Colostrum samples (average 22 per herd) were taken in 100 herds, and analyzed for Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (A. pleur) and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M.hyo) antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Only nine of 114 herds were judged to be free of mange. It was concluded that all finishing units received mange-infected feeder pigs each time the unit was filled. One or more acute erysipelas outbreaks had occurred in every fifth herd during the previous year. The risk of a finishing unit receiving feeder pigs carrying erysipelas was considered to be high. Swine dysentery (Serpulina hyodysenteriae) was not found to be a problem in the LSO area. Clostridium perfringens type C enteritis was found in eight (7%) herds. Seven of these herds were located in those supply areas where the PCC percentage of feeder pigs was high. In spite of statistical connection no causality between this disease and PCC was presumed. There were no previous diagnoses of respiratory diseases but spontaneous coughing was observed in 5% of the herds. Provocation testing induced coughing in 22% of herds but not serious coughing in any herd. Managers had observed coughing in 15% of herds. Ninety-one herds were positive in a colostrum ELISA for A. pleur antibodies, and eight herds were positive for M.hyo antibodies. A.pleur-positive herds had several positive or samples suspected of being positive in each herd bu M.hyo-positive herds had only one or two positive or suspected samples per herd. Six of the M.hyo herds were located in the high PCC area, two in the average PCC area and none in the low PCC area. M.hyo was suggested to be one of the possible explanations for geographical variation of PCC. Atrophic rhinitis was not considered to be of importance in LSO.",1
"Serum neutralization testing was used to determine transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) titers of up to 10 sows per herd (mean 8.7, median 10) for 392 herds that participated in the 3 month monitoring of sows and litters in the National Swine Survey. Of the sampled herds, 101 (25.8%) had sow seroprevalences of at least 80%, 79 (20.1%) had seroprevalences between 10 and 79%, and 212 (54.1%) were seronegative. For evaluation of risk factors for TGE seropositivity, analysis was restricted to herds with at least five tested sows and either 0% or at least 20% seropositive sows. In the logistic regression analysis, a herd was considered seropositive if at least 20% of sampled females had titers of 1: 8 or higher (n = 160), and a herd was seronegative if all females had titers of under 1: 8 (n = 178). Factors considered for inclusion in logistic regression models included breeding herd size, biosecurity measures, pig introductions and movements, and access of possible nonporcine reservoirs to the facilities with pigs. After controlling for the effects of season, number of samples tested and TGE vaccination history, large female breeding herd size (at least 500 sows compared with the reference category of 100–199 sows) and purchase of more than 25 pigs from non-specific pathogen free (SPF) herds were associated with significantly (P<0.05) higher odds of herd seropositivity (odds ratios 4.9 and 3.9, respectively). There was some evidence (P = 0.08) of an increased risk of seropositivity when there were more than two swine herds within a 3 mile radius of the study herd.",1
"Serological screening of swine herds in 1984 indicated that porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) had been introduced into Denmark. To determine risk factors associated with the introduction of PRCV, a cross-sectional study of 408 Danish swine herds was carried out between May 1985 and June 1986. The association between herd-PRCV serological status and possible risk factors, obtained from a field questionnaire, was assessed by unconditional maximum likelihood logistic regression. An increasing herd size, location in the Jutland peninsula (compared with location on the island of Funen) (OR = 7.9 in a multivariable logistic regression model not including interaction terms), the presence of a slurry system (i.e. pigs living on a slatted floor) (OR = 4.6) and purchase of pigs (OR= 1.7) were significantly (P < 0.05) associated with seropositivity. Two significant interactions, both involving herd size, were subsequently identified. The PRCV serological status of neighbouring herds was found to be related, and closeness of a seropositive herd was associated with an increased risk of a herd being serologically positive. The results of this study indicate that herd size may be an important determinant of airborne transmission of PRCV infection, and that herd size may modify the effect of other risk factors.",1
"The chemoprophylactic effects of paromomycin sulfate against natural cryptosporidiosis in young kids were investigated. Two studies were carried out using two groups of 18 and 12 animals in two pens. In each pen, kids were allocated to treated or control groups. The treatment consisted of oral paromomycin given at 100 mg kg−1 body weight day−1 for 11 consecutive days from 2 days of age. All kids were weighed at 2, 6 and 10 days of age. Infection was monitored by collecting fecal samples and staining fecal smears every 3–4 days from days 4 or 5 to days 15 or 19. The results clearly showed the efficacy of paromomycin in reducing cryptosporidial oocyst output. Moreover, paromomycin prevented clinical signs and mortality.",1
"In a field trial on a farm in Turkey, we tested whether specific egg-yolk antibodies had a prophylactic effect on neonatal diarrhea. Owing to its antibody spectrum, this egg powder was very suitable for this farm since mainly rotavirus was identified. Regardless of the dosage (2 g, 4 g, or 8 g egg powder), the calves (n = 164) which received specific egg-yolk antibodies via the whole egg during the first 14 days of life showed significant improvements in risk and duration of diarrhea and in body weight gain compared with calves of the control group (n = 80) which had not received any egg powder. These significant differences in body weight still persisted after 3 months of life. The mortality risk in the control group amounted to 8.8%, while in all egg powder groups (n = 164) only one calf died as a result of diarrhea. Breed-dependent differences in the parameters were not observed.",1
"A prospective study was carried out on 845 heifer calves born during 1991 on 30 Holstein dairy farms in southeast Minnesota. The objectives of the study were to describe the epidemiology of morbidity and mortality in dairy calves from birth to 16 weeks of age (with an emphasis on respiratory disease), to examine individual calf and herd management practices as risk factors for calf morbidity and mortality, and to validate producer diagnosis of mortality. Incidence rates for all morbidity, enteritis, and pneumonia were 0.20, 0.15, and 0.10 cases per 100 calf-days at risk for the period of the study. Risk of enteritis was highest in the first 3 weeks of life, with pneumonia risk highest at 10 weeks of age. Case fatality rates averaged 11.8%, 17.9%, and 9.4% for all diagnoses, enteritis, and pneumonia, respectively. Average daily rates of gain from birth to 16 weeks of age differed between farms that had inadequate calf housing (0.8 kg day−1) versus those with adequate calf housing (1.0 kg day−1). Approximately half of the calves in the cohort (418) had blood samples taken monthly from birth until 16 weeks of age. Of the calves sampled, only 19 calves showed a four-fold rise in serum titers to respiratory viruses. Sixteen calves seroconverted to BVDV, two calves to IBRV, and one calf to PI3 virus. Of 98 calves less than 10 days of age tested for adequacy of passive transfer, 35 (35.7%) had serum immunoglobulin levels of less than 800 mg dl−1. There were no significant differences in mortality or morbidity between calves that had adequate passive transfer and those that did not. The incidence of mortality was 0.08 deaths per 100 calf-days at risk; 64 calves died during the 16 months of the study. The risk of death was highest at 2 weeks of age. Enteritis was the most common cause of death (28 deaths, 44% of all deaths) followed by pneumonia (19 deaths, 30% of all deaths). Comparing producer diagnosis of mortality with necropsy results yielded sensitivities of 58.3% and 56% and specificities of 93% and 100% for producer diagnoses of enteritis and pneumonia, respectively. The kappa statistic comparing producer diagnosis with necropsy result was 0.47. The most common pathogens isolated from calves that died of enteritis were rotavirus (five calves), and Escherichia coli (four calves). Pathogens isolated from pneumonic lungs included Pasteurella multocida (three calves), Haemophilus somnus (three calves), and Pasteurella haemolytica (one calf).",1
"The effect of preweaning feeding of pasteurized colostrum and pasteurized waste milk on postweaning performance of dairy heifers on a dairy in the Central Valley of California was investigated as an extension of a clinical trial examining the effect of preweaning growth and morbidity on performance at weaning. Of the 150 heifer calves originally enrolled in the field trial, 115 calves (59 treatment, 56 controls) were followed to about 6 months of age, during which time their weights were measured. After weights were adjusted for several potential risk factors and effect modifiers, calves fed pasteurized colostrum and pasteurized waste milk were 3.7 kg heavier at 180 days of age than those fed nonpasteurized colostrum and nonpasteurized milk.",1
"Captive environments are believed to produce behavioral changes in animal populations that may limit our ability to generalize back to natural populations. These behavioral changes are thought to be associated with one or both of the following: (a) changes in frequencies of genes or gene complexes due to the effects of inbreeding or to changes in selection pressure; (b) changes in development of the phenotype due to the effects of changes in environmental variables. Inbreeding leads to increase in homozygosity, that may result in developmental anomalies because of a breakdown in developmental homeostasis. Changes in selection pressure may disrupt coadapted gene complexes that have evolved in the wild. Often, domestication is believed to result in individuals that are “degenerate”; i.e. inferior to individuals in the wild. However, this notion has received no empirical support. In fact, if phenotype changes do occur under domestication, these are usually quantitative, not qualitative, in nature. We suggest that the study of the domestication process may reveal evolutionary principles that would be difficult to discover in other ways, and the zoological parks may be ideal situations for such research.",1
"Following infection of RN2 rat Schwannoma cells with unfiltered JHMV inocula, a cell line with an altered phenotype evolved, which was shown to be a somatic cell hybrid of RN2 and mouse L-2 cells. This cell line, EJ, persistently yields JHMV at titres greater than 106 pfu/ml and does not show the suppression of virus production at 39.5 °C that is characteristic of a persistently infected RN2 line. Intracellular viral nucleocapsids are demonstrated. Cloning of EJ hybrids yields cell lines that show a variety of responses to infection by JHMV or MHV3.",1
"Damage to the Kupffer and endothelial cells of the liver sinusoids induced by the administration of sublethal doses of frog virus 3 (FV 3) renders A/J mice which are genetically resistant to mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV 3) highly susceptible to this virus. Liver histopathology of these animals revealed typical necrotic foci containing MHV 3-specific antigens. FV 3-pretreated mice, after MHV 3 infection, showed higher levels of serum transaminase (GPT) than controls, and MHV 3 replicated more rapidly and to higher titres. Our results bear out the important role of the liver sinusoidal lining in protecting against hepatocyte infection and its direct involvement in the resistance of A/J mice to MHV 3 infection.",1
"RNA was extracted from the diseased brain of a case of human subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) and analysed for the expression of measles-specific RNA. Measles virus-specific mRNAs were present, but the amount of matrix (M) protein mRNA was greatly reduced in comparison to lytically infected cells and phospho- (P) protein mRNA was hardly detectable whereas the level of the corresponding intermediate-sized (is-) RNA was greatly increased. RNA obtained from the human brain was also translated in vitro and measles virus nucleocapsid and P protein was produced. However, in marked contrast to control reactions M protein was not detected in the products formed by translation in vitro. These results indicate an impaired measles virus M protein mRNA synthesis in infected brain tissue.",1
"cDNA clones prepared from genomic RNA of coronavirus IBV have been sequenced. The nucleotide sequence for the complete 5' region of mRNA C, which is not present in mRNAs A and B, has been determined. A sequence of 1224 bases is presented which contains a long open reading frame predicting a polypeptide of molecular weight 25 443. This is in agreement with the molecular weight of 23 000 reported for the unglycosylated form of the membrane polypeptide.",1
"cDNAs derived from the 3'-terminus of IBV Beaudette genomic RNA by oligo(dT)-primed reverse transcription were cloned in PAT153/HB101. 25 clones were characterised and two of these were found to cover 3.3 kb extending from the poly(A) tail. The relationships of the two smallest IBV mRNAs, A and B, to the cloned sequences were established by restriction fragment hybridisation to Northern blots. The 5'-termini of mRNAs A and B were located on the clones by S1 mapping. DNA sequencing of cloned sequences corresponding to the intergenic boundaries of mRNAs A and B was carried out. Homologies between the sequences at these boundaries were observed.",1
"Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was adapted to Vero cells by serial passage. No significant inhibition of IBV replication was observed when infected Vero cells were treated with α-amanitin or actinomycin D. In thin sections of infected cells, assembly of IBV was observed at the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and mature IBV particles were located in dilated cisternae of the RER as well as in smooth cytoplasmic vesicles. In addition to typical IBV particles, enveloped particles containing numerous ribosomes were identified at later times postinfection. Monensin, a sodium ionophore which blocks glycoprotein transport to plasma membranes at the level of the Golgi complex, was found to inhibit the formation of infectious IBV. In thin sections of infected Vero cells treated with the ionophore, IBV particles were located in dilated cytoplasmic vesicles, but fewer particles were found when compared to controls. A similar pattern of virus-specific proteins was detected in control or monensin-treated IBV-infected cells, which included two glycoproteins (170000 and 24000 daltons) and a polypeptide of 52000 daltons. These results suggesl lhal the ionophore inhibits assembly of a virus which malures at intracellular membranes.",1
"A panel of 28 monoclonal antibodies (MAb) against the structural proteins of murine hepatitis virus-4, strain JHM (MHV-4) was used in three antigen binding assays to determine the extent of antigenic homology among six strains of murine coronaviruses. The antigenic determinants studied were highly conserved on the E1 glycoproteins and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of all strains tested. In contrast, antigenic polymorphism was observed among the E2 glycoproteins. Of three previously described antigenic determinants against which neutralizing antibodies are directed, only one, termed A(E2), was conserved on all strains. Antigenic site B(E2) was found only on the strongly neurotropic MHV-4 and site C(E2) was present on the virulent MHV-4 and MHV-3 (hepatotropic) strains, but absent on the weakly pathogenic MHV-A59, MHV-1 and MHV-S strains. Four non-neutralizing antibodies against at least one topographically distinct antigenic determinant, which we previously designated D(E2), gave binding patterns consistent with two distinct sites. One of these was present on all MHV strains tested and the other was present on all strains except MHV-S. These non-neutralizing antigenic sites were redesignated E(E2) and D(E2) respectively.",1
"Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a murine coronavirus, replicates in the cytoplasm and synthesizes 7 viral mRNAs containing an identical stretch of leader RNA sequences at the 5'-end of each RNA. The leader-coding sequences at the 5'-end of genomic RNA are at least 72 nucleotides in length and are joined to the viral mRNAs by a unique mechanism. Utilizing a leader-specific cDNA probe, we have detected several free leader RNA species ranging from 70 to 82 nucleotides in length. The predominant leader RNA was approximately 75 nucleotides. In addition, larger distinct leader-containing RNAs were also detected ranging from 130 to 250 nucleotides in length. The 70–82-nucleotide leader-related RNAs were present in both the cytosol and membrane fractions of infected cells. They were also detected only in the small RNA fractions but not associated with the replicative-intermediate RNA. These data suggest that the leader RNAs were associated with the membrane-bound transcription complex but at least part of them were dissociated from the RNA template. We have also identified a temperature-sensitive mutant, which synthesizes only leader RNA but not mRNAs at nonpermissive temperature, indicating that leader RNA synthesis is distinct from the transcription of mRNAs. These data support the leader-primed mechanism for coronavirus transcription and suggest that one or more free leader RNAs are used as primers of mRNA synthesis.",1
"Papaverine, an inhibitor of cAMP phosphodiesterase, reduced yields of infectious vesicular stomatitis virus in HEp-2 cells approximately 100-fold if added to cultures at a concentration of 30 μM before and after virus infection. The extent of papaverine-induced suppression of viral growth was dependent on drug dose and treatment regimen. Cells progressively recovered their viral permissive state after removal of drug. The cyclic nucleotide, cGMP, nullified the inhibitory effect of papaverine if added to cells during drug treatment. Pulse labeling experiments with [35S]methionine showed that papaverine compromises production of all virus-specific proteins in infected cells without adversely affecting host cell protein synthesis. Treatment of cells with papaverine strongly inhibited the production of viral RNA and both cellular RNA and DNA. It was found that VSV causes an immediate but transient stimulation of DNA synthesis in HEp-2 cells which is prevented by papaverine treatment. This drug also selectively blocked primary transcription of VSV in vivo and to a lesser extent in vitro RNA polymerase activity of the virion-bound transcriptase. The finding that papaverine has a strong inhibitory effect on viral biosynthesis including early transcription suggests that VSV replication may depend on host factors that regulate intracellular levels of cyclic nucleotides such as cAMP.",1
"The coronavirus JHMV persistently infects rat Schwannoma cells RN2-2 at 32.5°C and enters a host-imposed reversible, latent state at 39.5°C. JHMV can remain up to 20 days in the latent state and about 14 days before the cultures lose the capacity to resume virus production upon return to 32.5°C. Although persistently and latently infected RN2-2 cells display resistance to superinfection by a heterologous agent VSV, these cells do not release detectable soluble mediators (e.g., interferon) of the antiviral state. Nevertheless, RN2-2 cells are competent to synthesize and release interferon when treated with the appropriate inducers. These observations suggest that interferon does not play any role or may not be the major factor in the control of latency in the Schwannoma cell. Hybridization with virus-specific cDNAs shows that all viral mRNAs are present during latency and that viral mRNAs are present in the polysomes of infected cells at 39.5°C. Western immunoblotting with hybridoma antibodies demonstrates that viral specific proteins are produced at the restrictive temperature. These results",1
"Treatment of purified bovine coronavirus (Mebus strain) with pronase destroyed the integrity of virion surface glycoproteins gp140, gp120, gp100, reduced the amount of gp26 and destroyed the hemagglutinating activity of the virus. Bromelain, on the other hand, destroyed the integrity of gp120, gp100 and gp26 but failed to remove gp140 and failed to destroy viral hemagglutinating activity. These experiments suggest that gp140 is the virion hemagglutinin. Immunoblotting studies using monospecific antiserum demonstrate that gp140 is a disulfide-linked dimeric structure reducible to monomers of 65 kDa.",1
"Recombinant foot-and-mouth disease viruses were isolated from cells infected with a mixture of temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants belonging to different subtype strains. In order to select for recombination events in many different regions of the genome, crosses were performed between various pairs of mutants, with ts mutations in different regions of the genome. ts + progeny were analysed by electrofocusing virus-induced proteins and RNase T1 fingerprinting of their RNA. All but 5 out of 43 independent isolates, from nine crosses, proved to have recombinant RNA genomes. Maps of these genomes, based on a knowledge of the locations of the unique oligonucleotides, were constructed. Most could be interpreted as being the products of single genetic cross-overs, although three recombinants were formed by two cross-overs each. Cross-overs in at least twelve distinct regions of the genome were identified. This evidence of a large number of recombination sites suggests that RNA recombination in picornaviruses is a general, as opposed to a site-specific, phenomenon.",1
"The human respiratory coronavirus OC43 was grown on a human rectal tumor cell line and was isotopically labeled with amino acids, glucosamine, and orthophosphate to analyze virion structural proteins. Four major protein species were resolved by electrophoresis and many of their properties were deduced from digestion studies using proteolytic enzymes. The four proteins are: (1) A 190 kDa protein, the presumed peplomeric protein, that was glycosylated and proteolytically cleavable by trypsin into subunits of 110 and 90 kDa. The subunits each represent a different amino acid sequence on the basis of peptide mapping; (2) a 130 kDa protein that was glycosylated and behaved as a disulfide-linked dimer of 65 kDa molecules. It is the apparent virion hemagglutinin on the basis of digestion studies with trypsin, bromelain and pronase; (3) a 55 kDa nucleocapsid protein that was phosphorylated; (4) a 26 kDa matrix protein that was glycosylated. The 190, 130, 55 and 26 kDa species can therefore be designated P, H, N and M, respectively. They exist in molar ratios of 4:1: 33 : 33, and are calculated to be present at the rate of 88, 22, 726, and 726 molecules per virion, respectively.",1
"The amino acid sequence of the gene for the peplomer protein of the vaccine strain M41 and the Beaudette laboratory strain M42-Salk of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) have been derived from cDNA sequences. As found with other coronaviruses, the peplomer protein carries the epitopes eliciting neutralizing antibodies. The gene encodes a primary translation product of 1162 amino acids with a molecular weight of 128079. The use of a recent algorithm to predict membrane-protein interactions led to the unambiguous localization of the signah peptide and a transmembrane anchor α-helix at the C-terminus. At 50 positions amino acid differences were found between M41 and two Beaudette strains (M42-Salk and M42-Houghton). They are partly clustered in two regions of the protein. These two regions are candidates for neutralization epitopes of the protein.",1
"The spike protein of avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus comprises two glycopolypeptides S1 and S2 derived by cleavage of a proglycopolypeptide So, the nucleotide sequence of which has recently been determined for the Beaudette strain (Binns M.M. et al., 1985, J. Gen. Virol. 66, 719–726). The order of the two glycopolypeptides within So is aminoterminus(N)-Sl-S2-carboxyterminus(C). To locate the N-terminus of S2 we have performed partial amino acid sequencing on S2 from IBV-Beaudette labelled with [3H]serine and from the related strain IBV-M41 labelled with [3H]valine, leucine and isoleucine. The residues identified and their positions relative to the N-terminus of S2 were: serine, 13; valine, 6, 12; leucine, none in the first 20 residues; isoleucine, 2, 19. These results identified the N-terminus of S2 of IBV-Beaudette as serine, 520 residues from the N-terminus of S1, excluding the signal sequence. Immediately to the N-terminal side of residue 520 So has the sequence Arg-Arg-Phe-Arg-Arg; similar basic connecting peptides are a feature of several other virus spike glycoproteins. It was deduced that for IBV-Beaudette SI comprises 519 residues (M r 57.0K) or 514 residues (56.2K) if the connecting peptide was to be removed by carboxypeptidase-like activity in vivo while S2 has 625 residues (69.2K). Nucleotide sequencing of the cleavage region of the So gene of IBV-M41 revealed the same connecting peptide as IBV-Beaudette and that the first 20 N-terminal residues of S2 of IBV-M41 were identical to those of the Beaudette strain. IBV-Beaudette grown in Vero cells had some uncleaved So; this was cleavable by 10 μg/ml of trypsin and of chymotrypsin. Partial N-terminal analysis of S1 from IBV-M41 identified leucine and valine residues at positions 2 and 9 respectively from the N-terminus. This confirms the identification made by Binns et al. (1985), of the N-terminus of S1 and the end of the signal sequence of the IBV-Beaudette spike propolypeptide. N-terminal sequencing of [3H]leucine-labelled IBV-Beaudette membrane (M) polypeptide showed leucine residues at positions 8,16 and 22 from the N-terminus; these results confirm the open reading frame identified by M.E.G. Boursnell et al. (1984, Virus Res. 1, 303–313) in the nucleotide sequence of M. The N-terminus of the nucleocapsid (n) polypeptide appeared to be blocked.",1
"[35S]methionine-labelled avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (strain 41) and its purified protein components and virions of IBV-Beaudette were incubated with 10 proteases. Several proteases hydrolysed all or some of the membrane glycopoly-peptide (M; M r 30K) and removed about 1.3K of peptide from the amino-(N-)-terminus plus both glycans, as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. N-terminal analysis of [3H]isoleucine-labelled M after hydrolysis by bromelain revealed that the first nine residues had been removed. After the virions had been permeabilised with saponin, a further 2.5K decrease in molecular weight was produced and this was shown to be from the carboxy-(C-)terminus. When considered with the hydropathicity plot analysis of the amino acid sequence of M (Boursnell, M.E.G. et al., 1984, Virus Res. 1, 303–313) these results suggest that as few as 9–20 N-terminal amino acid residues may protrude at the outer membrane surface and that there is a highly protease sensitive sequence of an estimated 20–25 residues at the C-terminus of M exposed in the lumen of the virion. S2 but not SI was cleaved to a major glycopolypeptide of approximately 71K by several proteases, and to 76K by trypsin. N-terminal sequencing of the 71K glycopolypeptide revealed that it had the same N-terminus as intact S2. After hydrolysis in the presence and absence of saponin it was concluded that S2 is very sensitive to hydrolysis near its carboxy terminus at residues close to the outer membrane surface.",1
"Monensin inhibits the intracellular transport of the glycoproteins of Newcastle disease virus between cis and trans Golgi stacks of infected BHK cells, as evidenced by its effect upon their post-translational modifications such as fatty acid acylation, glycosylation and proteolytic cleavage. Thus the drug has markedly altered the subcellular distribution of the glycoproteins so that they accumulate in the internal smooth membranes but are virtually absent in the plasma membrane. These glycoproteins that accumulated in intracellular membranes have a cytoplasmic domain susceptible to protease digestion and thus are transmembranous. Under such conditions, the behavior of M protein, which plays a crucial role in virus assembly (Y. Nagai et al., 1976, Virology 69, 523–538), has been analyzed. It has been found that the M protein can neither associate with the internal membranes nor bind to the plasma membrane. Thus no virus budding has been observed, either at the plasma membranes or at internal membranes. These results substantiate the view that the interaction between M and glycoproteins is of great importance for virus assembly and suggest further that this interaction is possible only when the glycoproteins have been incorporated into the plasma membrane.",1
"We have found that genomic RNA synthesis is inhibited by cycloheximide in cells infected with mouse hepatitis virus, strain A59 (MHV-A59), in agreement with previously published results (Sawicki S.G. and Sawicki D.L. (1986) J. Virol. 57, 328–334). In the present study, the fate of the residual genomic RNA synthesized in the presence of cycloheximide was determined. Nearly all of the genomic RNA synthesized in the presence of drug was incorporated into nucleocapsid structures, suggesting that even in the absence of protein synthesis, genomic RNA synthesis and encapsidation are coupled in MHV-infected cells. Sufficient free nucleocapsid N protein was available for this purpose, since the pool of soluble N protein was determined to decay with a half-life of approximately one hour. Negative strand RNA is the template for the synthesis of both genomic and subgenomic positive strand RNA, and would be predicted to accumulate primarily during the early phases of the lytic cycle. In agreement with this prediction, negative strand RNA accumulated during the first 5–6 h of infection, with little additional accumulation occurring over the next 2.5 h. In marked contrast, positive strand RNA increased 5–6-fold over the same 2.5 h period. These results, taken in conjunction with published data, suggest that negative strand RNA is synthesized during the early period of the infectious cycle and is stable in infected cells and also suggest that treatment with cycloheximide at late times does not inhibit positive strand RNA synthesis indirectly by blocking the formation of negative strand templates.",1
"The amino acid sequence of the peplomer protein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) has been derived from the cloned cDNA sequence. The gene encodes a protein of 1447 amino acids with a molecular weight of 159 574. Comparison with the primary structure of the peplomer protein of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) (de Groot et al., 1987b) revealed one domain, from amino acids 1 to 274, in which the nucleotide homology was 39%, whereas in the second domain (from residues 275 to 1447) the homology was 93%.",1
"Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-JHM infection was studied in genetically susceptible (BALB/cByJ) and resistant (SJL/J) mice following intranasal inoculation at 1, 3, 6 or 12 wk of age. Markers of infection included histology, immunohistochemistry, virus quantification and virus serology. All BALE mice developed severe disseminated disease with high mortality due to encephalitis and hepatitis. Peak MHV titers appeared in brain, liver, spleen and intestine on days 3 or 5. Age at inoculation did not influence virus titers in brain, spleen or intestine, but virus titers in liver were inversely proportional to age at inoculation. In 6-wk-old BALE mice, virus was cleared from spleen, intestine and liver by day 30 and from brain by day 60. In intestine, MHV was localized to lymphoid tissue, without fecal excretion. SJL mice of all ages developed remarkably milder disease with low mortality occurring only among mice inoculated at 1 wk of age. SJL mice inoculated at 1 wk had disseminated infection at day 3, but lesions and antigen were cleared from most organs by day 5. Mice inoculated at 3 and 6 wk of age had minimal or no involvement of peripheral organs, and mice inoculated at 12 wk of age had infections restricted to the nose. At day 5, MHV titers in brain, liver, spleen and intestine were significantly lower or undetectable in SJL mice of all ages compared to age-matched BALB mice. In 6-wk-old mice, MHV was cleared from all organs by day 10. Serum antibody titers to MHV were many-fold higher in BALB mice, compared to SJL mice, which mounted only a modest response.",1
"Nine neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), each of which react with the haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) glycoprotein of the Beaudette C strain of Newcastle disease virus (NDV), have been used in competitive binding assays to delineate three non-overlapping antigenic sites A, B and C. Epitopes within these sites have been identified on the basis of cross-reactivity of MAb-resistant mutants against the panel of MAbs, determined by plaque assays and Western blotting. Site A contains three non-overlapping epitopes (A1, A2 and A3). A1 is the only linear epitope; all remaining epitopes are conformational. MAbs which react with epitopes A2 and A3 inhibit neuraminidase activity (NA) when assayed with neuraminlactose. Site B contains three partially overlapping epitopes (B1, B2 and B3) and site C is represented by a single epitope (C1). HN gene sequence analysis of MAb-resistant mutants showed that they each had only single amino acid substitutions which range from amino acid residues 347–460 for site A, 284–325 for site B, and at 481 for the Cl epitope. The apparent molecular mass of the HN glycoprotein of one mutant was increased from 72 to 75 kDa. This correlates well with the creation of an additional potential glycosylation site in this mutant from Asn-Ser-Pro(325) to Asn-Ser-Ser(325).",1
"Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) gene 27 transcripts in infected cells. The SalI-G DNA fragment, located in the unique long segment of the VZV genome and containing overlapping genes 26 and 27, was analyzed in an in vitro transcription-translation system. Translation of RNA transcribed from these open reading frames showed prominent expression of gene 27. Four different subclones were constructed to contain gene 27 with and without 100 base pairs (bp) of upstream sequences. Translation of RNA from these constructs using wheat germ extract or rabbit reticulocyte lysate indicated that the sequences upstream from the predicted intiation codon (AUG) of gene 27 downregulated the expression of this gene at the level of translation and that the predicted AUG within gene 27 was preferentially used.",1
"The JHM strain of murine hepatitis coronavirus is neurotropic in rats, causing either fatal acute encephalomyelitis or subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis. We have examined the growth properties of three JHM virus isolates in primary rat glial cultures and found a correlation with their ability to cause disease. Wild type JHM virus has the propensity to cause lytic infections in glial cultures, and a temperature-sensitive mutant designated JHM-ts43 invariably produces persistent infections with reduced cytopathic effects (CPE) as compared to the wild type. Moreover, a non-neurotropic isolate, designated JHM-Pi virus, produces either non-productive persistent infections at low multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) or productive persistent infections at high m.o.i., with, however, no CPE. The phenotypic expression of persistence is glial cell-dependent, since all three viruses produce similarly lytic infections when grown on various susceptible cell lines. The genetic basis of JHM virus persistence can be explained at the level of direct virus-glial cell interactions.",1
"The spike glycoprotein (S) gene of IBV codes for a precursor protein which is cleaved into the N-terminal S1 and C-terminal S2 glycopolypeptides. The S1 glycopolypeptide, which induces neutralizing antibody, comprises approximately 520 amino acid residues. We have determined the nucleotide sequence of S1 of seven strains of the Massachusetts (Mass) serotype and the first 337 bases of two additional Mass strains. Despite the fact that the strains had been isolated over three decades in Europe and the U.S.A. there was only 4% base and 6% amino acid variation within the group. Nearly one third of the 32 amino acid differences in S1 were in two hypervariable regions (HVRs 1 and 2) comprising residues 38–51 and 99–115, identified by Niesters et al. (1986), showing that HVRs 1 and 2 are a feature of the Mass serotype. Amino acid variation within HVRs 1 and 2 was 29% and 40% respectively. Five vaccine strains could be distinguished from each other by sequencing of the first 337 nucleotides. Variants of M41 which resisted neutralization by two monoclonal antibodies (A13 and A38) had the same, single base change at position 134, resulting in substitution of proline residue 45 by histidine. This indicates that residues within HVR 1 are associated with epitopes which induce neutralizing antibody.",1
"The antigenic structure of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus E2 glycoprotein has been defined at three levels: antigenic sites, antigenic subsites and epitopes. Four antigenic sites (A, B, C and D) were defined by competitive radioimmunoassay (RIA) using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) selected from 9 fusions. About 20% (197) of the hybridomas specific for TGE virus produced neutralizing MAbs specific for site A, which was one of the antigenically dominant determinants. Site A was differentiated in three antigenic subsites: a, b and c, by characterization of 11 MAb resistant (mar) mutants, that were defined by 8, 3, and 3 MAbs, respectively. These subsites were further subdivided in epitopes. A total of 11 epitopes were defined in E2 glycoprotein, eight of which were critical for virus neutralization. Neutralizing MAbs were obtained only when native virus was used to immunize mice, although to produce hybridomas mice immunizations were made with antigen in the native, denatured, or mixtures of native and denatured form. All neutralizing MAbs reacted to conformational epitopes. The antigenic structure of the E2-glycoprotein has been defined with murine MAbs, but the antigenic sites were relevant in the swine, the natural host of the virus, because porcine sera reacted against these sites. MAbs specific for TGE virus site C reacted to non-immune porcine sera. This reactivity was not directed against porcine immunoglobulins. These results indicated that TGE virus contains epitope(s) also present in some non-immunoglobulin component of porcine serum.",1
"A previous study from our laboratory showed that a mutant of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), strain KOS-321, carrying a deletion in the structural gene for glycoprotein C (gC) had reduced pathogenicity for the mouse central nervous system when compared to the wild-type virus (Kümel et al., 1985). In this study, eight additional gC negative (gC−) mutants derived from KOS-321 were shown to vary widely in their ability to induce lethal encephalitis in female DBA/2 mice following intracerebral inoculation. This variation in virulence showed no correlation with thymidine kinase activity. One less virulent gC− strain, gC−39, was further studied to determine whether the neurovirulent phenotype could be restored by rescue of the gC gene using standard marker rescue cotransfection procedures. The resulting progeny contained 2% gC+ recombinant virions and was tested for its ability to cause encephalitis. Although this progeny had increased virulence, it was not attributable to the acquisition of the gC gene since passive immunization of mice with a pool of anti-gC monoclonal antibodies had no effect on the development of encephalitis and only gC−viruses were isolated from diseased brain tissues. In agreement with these findings, individual plaque-purified gC positive (gC+) virus recombinants were shown not to have been restored to the wild-type virus level of neurovirulence. It is concluded that gC is not a virulence determinant in this mouse model of HSV-induced encephalitis and that cotransfection procedures can induce additional mutations that affect viral pathogenesis.",1
"Electronmicroscopy has indicated that turkey rhinotracheitis virus (TRTV), the causative agent of an acute repiratory disease in turkeys, is a member of the Paramyxoviridae family. To determine if TRTV belongs to one of the three defined genera of this family (Paramyxovirus, Morbillivirus and Pneumovirus) we have analysed the RNA and proteins induced during replication of TRTV in Vero cells. Following replication in the presence of actinomycin D 10 polyadenylated RNA bands, ranging in M r from 0.22 to 2.0 × 106, were detected in infected cells; some bands probably contained 2 or more RNA species. Viral proteins were studied after radiolabelling in the presence of [35S]methionine and [3H]glucosamine. Comparison of the polypeptides in mock-infected and infected cells, virions and nucleocapsids and after lentil-lectin chromatography and immunoprecipitation revealed seven virus-specific polypeptides (p), some of which were glycosylated (gp): gp82 (M r 82K), gp68, gp53, gp15, p43, p40 and p35. These are considered to be analogous to the large glycopolypeptide (HN, H and G), fusion protein precursor F0, the F protein cleavage products F1 and F2, nucleocapsid (N), phosphorylated (P) and matrix (M) polypeptides, respectively, of the Paramyxoviridae. Two other polypeptides (M r 200K and 22K) were also detected, as was a glycopolypeptide of M r 97K, probably related to gp82. Tunicamycin inhibited glycosylation of gp53 and gp15 but gp82 was little affected, most glycans still being present on a glycopolypeptide of approximately 79K. This finding, indicating that gp82 has mostly O-linked glycans, considered with the mRNA profile and the molecular weight of the N protein shows that of the three genera in this family, TRTV most closely resembles the Pneumovirus genus.",1
"The structure and synthesis of bovine coronavirus (BCV)-specific intracellular RNA were studied. A genome-size RNA and seven subgenomic RNAs with molecular weights of approximately 3.3 × 106, 3.1 × 106, 2.6 × 106, 1.1 × 106, 1.0 × 106, 0.8 × 106 and 0.6 × 106 were detected. Comparisons of BCV intracellular RNAs with those of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) demonstrated the presence of an additional RNA for BCV, species 2a, of 3.1 × 106 daltons. BCV RNAs contain a nested-set structure similar to that of other coronaviruses. This nested-set structure would suggest that the new RNA has a capacity to encode a protein of approximately 430 amino acids. Kinetic studies demonstrated that the synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs and genomic RNA are differentially regulated. At 4 to 8 h post-infection (p.i.), subgenomic RNAs are synthesized at a maximal rate and represent greater than 90% of the total viral RNA synthesized, whereas genome-size RNA accounts for only 7%. Later in infection, at 70 to 72 h p.i., genome-size RNA is much more abundant and accounts for 88% of total RNA synthesized. Immunoprecipitations of [35S]methionine-pulse-labeled viral proteins demonstrated that viral protein synthesis occurs early in the infection, concurrent with the peak of viral subgenomic RNA synthesis. Western blot analysis suggests that these proteins are stable since the proteins are present at high level as late as 70 to 72 h p.i. The kinetics of production of virus particles coincides with the synthesis of genomic RNA. These studies thus indicate that there is a differential temporal regulation of the synthesis of genomic RNA and subgenomic mRNAs, and that the synthesis of genomic RNA is the rate-limiting step regulating the production of virus particles.",1
"The region of the TGEV genome between the E1-matrix protein gene and the E2-peplomer protein gene has been sequenced from a cDNA clone. The consensus recognition sequence, 5 ′AA TT CTAAAC was found upstream from 3 large open reading frames. In coronaviruses these homologous recognition sequences are involved in the initiation of transcription suggesting that there are 3 mRNA species in this region of the TGEV genome. Northern blot analysis and nuclease S1 mapping confirmed the presence of 3 mRNA species between mRNA 3 encoding the E2-peplomer protein and mRNA 6 encoding the E1-matrix protein. The 5′ regions of these 3 mRNAs encode potential polypeptides of predicted molecular weight; 7859, 27744 and 9287, respectively. The potential translation product of ORF B (27744 Da) is considerably larger than previously reported and could be difficult to distinguish by size from the E1-matrix protein.",1
"A genome rearrangement involving RNA segment 11 of a bovine rotavirus has been analysed by molecular cloning and sequencing. This revealed that the rearranged genome segment was generated by a head to tail concatemerisation of two almost full length copies of segment 11. The upstream copy of the gene has lost its 3' end and the downstream copy its 5' end. The truncation of the upstream copy of the gene occurs within the termination codon for VP11 converting it from a UAG to a UGA, the rearranged gene is therefore still able to encode a normal VP11. The possible mechanisms by which this rearrangement may have been generated are discussed.",1
"Cell lines were constructed which permanently express influenza virus-specific RNA. Two approaches were followed. C127 cells were transformed with bovine papilloma virus (BPV) vectors and the resulting cell lines were found to inhibit the replication of influenza virus at low multiplicity of infection (MOI 0.05). However, examination of cellular RNA using single-stranded probes revealed the presence of both ( + )sense and antisense RNA transcripts (45–70 copies per cell). In this BPV-based system the inhibitory activity appeared to be associated with a nonspecific, interferon (IFN)-mediated effect. In the second approach, an expression system was used which involved 293 cells, a chimeric human cytomegalovirus (CMV)/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) promoter, and methotrexate- (Mtx)-mediated gene amplification. Cells were found to express up to 7500 copies of influenza virus-specific RNA per cell at a steady state level. In this system no RNA transcripts of the opposite orientation were found. However, all cell lines permanently expressing either (−)sense or ( + )sense viral RNA failed to reduce influenza virus titers in a multi-cycle replication experiment (MOI 0.01).",1
"The nucleotide sequence of the 3'-end of the genomic RNA of human coronavirus OC43 (HCV-OC43) was determined from the cDNA clones of the intracellular virus-specific mRNAs. The nucleotide sequence and the predicted amino acid sequence of the main open reading frame (ORF), which represents the nucleocapsid (N) protein, were highly homologous to those of bovine coronavirus (BCV) Mebus strain. This ORF predicts a protein of 448 amino acids. Additional smaller ORFs are also present in a different reading frame. We have also determined the leader sequence present at the 5'-end of HCV-OC43 mRNAs by a primer extension study. This sequence is highly homologous to that of mouse hepatitis virus, particularly in the 3'-end of the leader sequence, which is postulated to be involved in the unique mechanism of leader-primed transcription. These data suggest that HCV-OC43 and BCV might have diverged from each other fairly recently and that the 3'-end of the leader sequence has significant functional roles.",1
"A series of hydroxyguanidine derivatives, which are substituted salicylaldehyde Schiff-bases of 1-amino-3- hydroxyguanidine tosylate, were tested for the inhibition of RNA synthesis of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). It was shown that these compounds could selectively inhibit virus-specific RNA synthesis. Every aspect of viral RNA synthesis, including synthesis of negative-stranded RNA, subgenomic mRNA transcription and genomic RNA replication, was inhibited to roughly the same extent. These compounds are the first known inhibitors of coronaviral RNA synthesis and should prove useful for understanding the mechanism of viral RNA synthesis.",1
"A coronavirus which was isolated from a cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) that succumbed to feline infectious peritonitis was characterized in vitro. The virus was determined to be highly cell-associated with Crandell feline kidney (CrFK) cells and was routinely maintained as a persistent infection (CrFK 83–4497). The cheetah coronavirus was compared with other members of the feline coronavirus group including the feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) 79–1683 and the feline infectious peritonitis viruses (FIPV), 79–1146, and UCD-1. The cheetah coronavirus was demonstrated to have a restricted host-cell range with limited cytopathic effect. Indirect immunofluorescence with antisera to FIPV UCD-1 revealed the concentration of viral antigens in the perinuclear region of cells infected with the cheetah coronavirus. Ultrastructural studies of the cheetah coronavirus indicated a limited number of immature viral particles within cytoplasmic vesicles and at the cell surface. This was in contrast to electron microscopy results of FECV 79–1683 and FIPV 79–1146, which had numerous mature virus particles within the cytoplasmic vesicles, as well as at the cell surface. The cheetah coronavirus was tentatively placed in the feline coronavirus family based upon its antigenic reactivity by immunofluorescence; however, the possibility that it represents a unique coronavirus of cheetahs should not be dismissed without further analyses at the host and genomic levels.",1
"The receptors for the hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV, a porcine coronavirus) on chicken erythrocytes were analyzed and compared to the receptors for bovine coronavirus (BCV) and influenza C virus. Evidence was obtained that HEV requires the presence of N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2) on the cell surface for agglutination of erythrocytes as has been previously shown for BCV and influenza C virus: (i) Incubation of red blood cells with sialate 9-O-acetylesterase, the receptor-destroying enzyme of influenza C virus, rendered the erythrocytes resistant against agglutination by each of the three viruses; (ii) Human erythrocytes which are resistant to agglutination by HEV acquire receptors for HEV after resialylation with Neu5,9Ac2. Sialylation of red blood cells with limiting amounts of sialic acid indicated that strain JHB/1/66 of influenza C virus requires less Neu5,9Ac2 for agglutination of erythrocytes than the two coronaviruses, both of which were found to be similar in their reactivity with Neu5,9Ac2-containing receptors.",1
"The peplomer protein (S) and the transmembrane protein (M) of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of swine were identified by iodination and serologically on the surface of infected cells. Of a total of 4 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) directed against four antigenic sites of S protein (Correa et al., 1988), 3 specific for sites A, B and D attached to the plasma membrane of infected cells, as disclosed by indirect immunofluorescence and by complement-mediated cytolysis. Four of the mAbs assayed were specific for the viral protein M and two of them gave plasma membrane immunofluorescence and mediated cytolysis in the presence of complement. The viral nucleoprotein N could not be demonstrated on the surface of infected cells either by iodination or employing 3 mAbs against this protein. Finally, a time course infection experiment demonstrated that S and M proteins were expressed on the surface of infected cells at 4 h after infection, before infective virus was released from infected cells.",1
"Subgenomic mRNA from a virulent field isolate of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), strain FS772/70, was used to produce cDNA. The cDNA from three overlapping clones was sequenced by the chain termination method and two open reading frames (ORFs) were identified. The largest ORF, 4350bp, encoded a polypeptide of 1449 amino acids of relative molecular mass (Mr) 159811, which contained 33 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, a cysteine-rich region, and a potential transmembrane region. The C-terminal half of this ORF showed homology to the S proteins of four other coronaviruses. The other ORF consisted of the 3'-end of a gene with homology to the carboxyl terminus of the F2 subunit of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) RNA polymerase.",1
"A recombinant baculovirus system has been used to express the amino terminal half of the murine coronavirus (JHMV) peplomer glycoprotein in insect cells. The expressed polypeptide is glycosylated and is recognized by a set of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for JHMV S protein. Three of these mAbs have a very high neutralizing activity for JHMV but not for other MHV strains. These results indicate that JHMV-specific, major neutralizing epitopes reside in the amino terminal S1 subunit of the peplomer glycoprotein.",1
"Porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) nucleoprotein and integral membrane protein genes were cloned into the vaccinia virus insertion vector, pGS20, in the correct orientation for expression under the control of the vaccinia P 7.5K promoter. Recombinant vaccinia viruses were generated by in vivo homologous recombination of the insertion vector with the WR strain of vaccinia virus. Nucleoprotein (N) expressed by both recombinant vaccinia virus and TGEV had a relative molecular mass (M r) of 47,000 and was susceptible to degradation at the C-terminus yielding discrete breakdown products. The integral membrane protein (M) expressed by a recombinant vaccinia virus and TGEV was sensitive to endogly-cosidase H reducing the mature polypeptide of M r 29,000 to a species of M r 27,000. Expression of M by recombinant vaccinia virus was inhibited during early infection due to a cryptic vaccinia virus transcriptional termination signal within the TGEV coding sequence. Indirect immunofluorescence showed that both N and M were only localised in the cell cytoplasm of either TGEV or recombinant vaccinia virus infected cells. Antisera from mice infected with recombinant viruses immunoprecipitated specific TGEV antigens from lysates of TGEV infected cells but had little significant TGEV neutralising activity in vitro.",1
"Previous analysis of porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) mRNA species showed that mRNAs 2 and 3 were smaller than the corresponding transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) mRNA species (Page et al. (1991) J. Gen. Virol. 72, 579–587). Sequence analysis showed that mRNA 3 was smaller due to the presence of a new putative RNA-leader binding site upstream of the PRCV ORF-3 gene. However, this observation did not explain the deletion observed in PRCV mRNA 2. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to generate cDNA from the 3' coding region of the putative polymerase gene to the poly (A) tail of PRCV for comparison to the equivalent region from TGEV. The PRCV S protein was found to consist of 1225 amino acids, which had 98% similarity to the TGEV S protein. However, the PRCV S gene contained a 672 nucleotide deletion, corresponding to 224 amino acids (residues 21 to 245 in TGEV S protein), 59 nucleotides downstream of the S gene initiation codon. The PRCV genome from the ORF-3 gene to the poly (A) tail was sequenced for comparison to TGEV in order to identify other potential differences between the two viruses. Four ORFs were identified that showed 98% similarity to the TGEV ORF-4, M, N and ORF-7 genes. No other deletions or any PRCV specific sequences were identified.",1
"A recombinant baculovirus containing a cDNA which encodes haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) was constructed. Spodoptera frugiperda cells infected with this recombinant virus produced a large amount of HN glycoprotein similar to the authentic HN in size. The recombinant HN glycoprotein was localized on the surface of the infected cells and conserved its haemadsorption and neuraminidase activities. The antigenic properties of the recombinant HN glycoprotein seemed to be slightly different from the authentic one, as judging by the reactivity with a panel of monoclonal antibodies specific to the antigenic sites responsible for neutralization of viral infectivity. Chickens inoculated with the cells infected with the recombinant virus developed haemagglutination-inhibition and virus neutralization antibodies, and were completely protected from the NDV challenge.",1
"Six variant viruses of the JHMV strain of murine coronavirus with large (cl-2, CNSV, DL and DS) or small (sp-4 and JHM-X) S proteins were compared in terms of their relative neurovirulence in weanling Lewis rats. Inoculation of various doses of the variants revealed that the cl-2 and CNSV were highly virulent and DL and DS were low-virulent, while sp-4 and JHM-X were avirulent. Pathological examination of rats infected with variants cl-2, DL and sp-4 showed that the cl-2 and DL induced severe and mild acute encephalomyelitis, respectively, while no lesions were observed in the central nervous system of rats infected with sp-4. Virus growth and distribution of antigen in rat brains correlated strongly with neurovirulence. These results suggest that S protein plays a role in neurovirulence in rats. In addition, these variant viruses were shown to be useful tools for further analysis of JHMV neurovirulence in animals as well as in cultured cells.",1
"The carbohydrate composition and the immunoreactivity of the S and M glycoproteins of the coronavirus TGEV were studied at different stages of their maturation. The biosynthesis of S and M was analyzed in the presence of tunicamycin and monensin. The effect of treatment with endoglycosidases H and F and glycopeptidase F on the precursors and mature forms of S and M were also examined. Species 175K and 29K were characterized as high mannose forms of S and M, respectively, and species 220K and 30–36K as complex type glycosylated forms of these two proteins. M was present mainly as a 29K species in mature virions whereas the 175K form of S was not detected, thus implying that the two proteins undergo Golgi modifications at a far different efficiency. Anti-S and -M monoclonal antibodies were examined for their reactivity towards polypeptide species either treated with endo H or produced in the presence of tunicamycin. It was found that (i) among the four major antigenic sites previously defined (Delmas et al., 1986), only site C (amino acids 363 to 371) was notably expressed by the unglycosylated S polypeptide 155K, whereas the three other sites were dependent upon core-glycosylation, (ii) three of the four anti-M mAbs tested did not recognize the unglycosylated M polypeptide 26K. These data led us to conclude that co-translational, but not terminal glycosylation is an essential requirement for both acquisition and maintenance of the antigenicity of TGEV glycoproteins.",1
"Human coronaviruses (HCV) are important pathogens responsible for respiratory, gastrointestinal and possibly neurological disorders. To better understand the molecular biology of the prototype HCV-229E strain, the nucleotide sequence of the 5'-unique regions of mRNAs 4 and 5 were determined from cloned cDNAs. Sequence analysis of the cDNAs synthesized from mRNA 4 revealed a major difference with previously published results. However, polymerase chain reaction amplification of this region showed that the sequenced cDNAs were produced from minor RNA species, an indication of possible genetic polymorphism in this region of the viral genome. The mutated messenger RNA 4 contains two ORFs: (1) ORF4a consisting of 132 nucleotides which potentially encodes a 44-amino acid polypeptide of 4653 Da; this coding sequence is preceded by a consensus transcriptional initiation sequence, CUAAACU, similar to the ones found upstream of the N and M genes; (2) ORF4b of 249 nucleotides potentially encoding an 83-amino acid basic and leucine-rich polypeptide of 9550 Da. On the other hand, mRNA 5 contains one single ORF of 231 nucleotides which could encode a 77-amino acid basic and leucine-rich polypeptide of 9046 Da. This putative protein presents a significant degree of amino acid homology (33%) with its counterpart found in transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV). The proteins in the two different viruses exhibit similar molecular weights and are extremely hydrophobic. Interestingly, a sequence homology of five amino acids was found between the protein encoded by ORF4b of HCV-229E and an immunologically important region of human myelin basic protein.",1
"We have studied the oligomerization of the membrane glycoproteins of Punta Toro virus (PTV), a member of the Phlebovirus genus of the family Bunyaviridae, and the effect of glycosylation on protein stability and transport. By using sucrose gradient centrifugation, the G1 and G2 glycoproteins in PTV-infected or recombint-transfected cells were found to sediment as dimers after DSP cross-linking, suggesting that the G1 and G2 proteins are associated as dimers by non-covalent interactions. Pulse-chase and two-dimensional gel analysis indicate that dimerization occurs between newly synthesized G1 and G2 proteins, and that a small fraction of the G2 proteins is assembled into G2 homodimers. The amounts of G1 and G2 proteins were substantially decreased, while the amounts of nucleocapsid protein remained nearly unchanged, when PTV-infected cells were treated with the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin, indicating that the G1 and G2 proteins are unstable if glycosylation is prevented.",1
"The 3'-terminal 1314 nucleotides of the genome of one isolate of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, LDV-P, has been derived by sequence analyses of cDNAs from several genomic libraries and compared to that of another LDV isolate, LDV-C (Godeny et al. (1990) Virol. 177, 768–771). The 3'-non-coding segment of 80 nucleotides of the two LDV genomes is identical, whereas marked, but varying nucleotide and amino acid divergence is apparent in the three upstream overlapping open reading frames (ORF). The third ORF from the 3'-end exhibits only 82% nucleotide and 90% amino acid identity, whereas the 3'-terminal ORF, which encodes the nucleocapsid protein, exhibits approximately 99% amino acid identity. The second 3'-terminal ORF encodes an 18.8 kDa protein which lacks N-glycosylation sites but possesses 2 or 3 potential transmembrane helices in the N-terminal half of the molecule. A similar membrane organization is observed for the corresponding protein of equine arteritis virus and the M protein of mouse hepatitis virus. The sequence analyses combined with Northern hybridization analyses of RNA from LDV-infected macrophages and spleens of LDV-infected mice indicate that the three ORFs encoded by the 3'-terminal end of the LDV genome are expressed via the three smallest mRNAs (mRNAs 6–8) of the seven subgenomic mRNAs of LDV (mRNAs 2–8), which range in size from about 0.8 to 3.6 kb. All mRNAs have been shown to carry poly(A)-tracts and a common leader sequence. The seven mRNAs were produced in infected macrophage cultures concomitantly with genomic LDV RNA. Maximum LDV RNA synthesis was observed between 6 and 8 h post-infection. The same seven subgenomic mRNAs were detected in macrophages infected with three different isolates of LDV, but different relative amounts of some of the mRNAs were produced. The relative proportions of molecules of mRNAs 1–8 present in 6 h LDV-P-infected macrophages were about 13, 5, 5, 8, 6, 11, 11 and 27% of the total, respectively.",1
"The natural sequence variations of the nucleocapsid genes of the Gray, Arkansas99 (Ark99), and Holland52 (Holl52) strains of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were determined. These were compared with previously published sequencing data of other IBV strains, as well as other coronaviruses, in order to correlate the serological and evolutionary relationship of coronaviruses. IBV nucleotide sequence alignment shows that overall the sequences are highly conserved, with homologies from 91.1 to 96.5%. However, there are also two regions (730 to 800 and 1138 to 1166) that appear to be even more highly conserved. Overall, the nucleocapsid protein is highly variable both in size and composition between coronavirus major antigenic groups but is conserved within these groups. A phylogenetic tree of the nucleocapsid protein of various coronaviruses indicates that the coronaviruses fall into distinct groups that correspond to the three major antigenic groups; however, a phylogenetic tree of the IBV nucleocapsid shows that this does not hold true for the type specific antigenic groups of IBV.",1
Purified preparations of the Spanish field isolate of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus AST/89 were found to contain the plus-stranded genomic RNA of more than 7.4 kilobases (kb) and large amounts of a subgenomic mRNA of 2.4 kb. The smaller RNA was translated in vitro and shown to code for a 60 kDa protein which was immunoprecipitated using anti-RHDV as well as anti-VP60 sera.,1
"Two receptor binding variants of the influenza virus A/Tübingen/12/85 (H1N1) were separated by their different plaque formation in MDCK cells. Hemagglutination of variant I was restricted to red blood cells of guinea pigs, whereas variant II also hemagglutinated chicken cells. The variants differed also in their ability to bind to α2,6-linked sialic acid. Evidence is presented that this difference is determined by a complex carbohydrate side chain at asparagine131 near the receptor binding site which is absent in variant II. With both variants, the arginine found at the cleavage site of all other human isolates analyzed so far was replaced by lysine.",1
"Previous studies on infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) cDNA have identified a region of about 184 bases in the 3' non-coding terminus of both the U.S. prototype strain (Beaudette) and a Japanese strain (KB8523), that was not present in an antigenically closely related U.S. strain, Massachusetts (Mass) 41 (Boursnell et al., 1985; Sutou et al., 1988). In order to investigate the origin and function of this region and its occurrence in nature, the cDNA sequences of the 3' non-coding regions of three additional strains of IBV, Gray, Arkansas (Ark) 99 and Holland (Holl) 52, were determined and compared to the sequences of the Beaudette, KB8523 and Mass41 strains. Not only was this U-rich sequence absent from the 3' non-coding region of the Mass41 strain, it was also highly variable, especially in comparison to the highly conserved 3' non coding region downstream of this sequence. Computer analyses of the sequences adjacent to this hypervariable region (HVR) showed that the 3' end of the IBV genome was highly conserved downstream of this region, with 94.3 to 97.8% similarity. However, the similarities for the HVR ranged from 53.2% between Ho1152 and Ark99, to 92.8% between Beaudette and Gray. The flanking sequences were not only conserved but these sequences upstream and downstream of the HVR also formed mirrored images.",1
"Enterotropic strains of murine coronaviruses (MHV-Y and MHV-RI) differ extensively in their pathogenesis from the prototypic respiratory strains of murine coronaviruses. In an effort to determine which viral proteins might be determinants of enterotropism, immunoblots of MHV-Y and MHV-RI virions using anti-S, -N and -M protein-specific antisera were performed. The uncleaved MHV-Y and MHV-RI S proteins migrated slightly faster than the MHV-A59 S protein. The MHV-Y S protein was inefficiently cleaved. The MHV-Y, MHV-RI and MHV-A59 N and M proteins showed only minor differences in their migration. The S genes of MHV-Y and MHV-RI were cloned, sequenced and found to encode 1361 and 1376 amino acid long proteins, respectively. The presence of several amino acids changes upstream from the predicted cleavage site of the MHV-Y S protein may contribute its inefficient cleavage. A high degree of homology was found between the MHV-RI and MHV-4 S proteins, whereas the homology between the MHV-Y S protein and the S proteins of other MHV strains was much lower. These results indicate that the enterotropism of MHV-RI and MHV-Y may be determined by different amino acid changes in the S protein and/or by changes in other viral proteins.",1
"A biotinylated-oligonucleotide-based method was used to isolate the subgenomic mRNAs of the coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) to investigate the amounts of the mRNAs produced at early, middle and late times in the replication cycle. TGEV mRNA 6, which encodes the N protein, was observed to be the most abundant species throughout the replication cycle. The ratios of mRNA 6 to the other mRNAs were 1:0.11 (mRNA 2), 1:0.16 (mRNAs 3 and 4) and 1:0.37 (mRNA 5) at 12 h post-infection. All the mRNA species were differentially regulated throughout the replication cycle, although the rate of accumulation of mRNAs 4, 5, and 6, but not mRNA 3, increased markedly towards the end of the replication cycle. mRNA 7 was not detected in the system used. There was no observable correlation between the amounts of each mRNA synthesised and the potential degree of base pairing between the 3′ end of the leader sequence and the transcription associated sequences on the genomic RNA at any time during the replication cycle. This indicates that the extent of base pairing was not the only factor involved in the control of subgenomic mRNA synthesis.",1
"Rubella virus (RV) virions contain two envelope glycoproteins, E1 and E2. Removal of hydrophobia regions in their carboxyl termini by genetic engineering caused them to be secreted rather than maintained in cell membranes of transfected COS cells. Truncated E2 was secreted in the absence of E1, whereas E1 lacking its transmembrane domain required coexpression of E2 for export from the cell. Secreted E2 was found to contain both O-linked and N-linked complex glycans, whereas secreted E1 retained virus neutralization and hemagglutination epitopes, suggesting the possibility of using soluble RV antigens as subunit vaccines and for serodiagnostic purposes. Stable Chinese hamster ovary cell lines secreting RV E1 were constructed for large scale preparation of recombinant E1.",1
"The nucleotide sequences of the membrane (M) protein genes and their deduced amino acid sequences of three enterotropic strains of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) -Y, -RI and -DVIM were determined and compared with the previously reported sequences of two respiratory MHV strains -A59 and -JHM. The five MHV strains shared extensive nucleotide (95.2–99.0%) as well as amino acid homology (95.6–98.7%). A variable region, including a 15 nucleotide deletion unique to MHV-RI, could be identified at the 5'-terminus of the gene. This region of the M protein may be immunogenic and may contribute to the antigenic diversity of the MHV strains. Sequence relationships between the strains showed no correspondence with the primary cell tropism. This may suggest that evolution of enterotropism was not a single occurrence among different MHV strains. No sequence unique to either tropism group could be identified, indicating that the M protein of MHV probably has no part in the determination of MHV tissue tropism.",1
"The mechanism of synthesis of the seven subgenomic mRNAs of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) was explored. One proposed mechanism, leader-primed transcription, predicts the formation of free 5'-leader in infected cells which then primes reinitiation of transcription at specific complementary sites on the antigenomic template. No free LDV 5'-leader of 156 nucleotides was detected in LDV-infected macrophages. Another mechanism, independent replication of the subgenomic mRNAs, predicts the presence of negative complements to all subgenomic mRNAs in infected cells which might be generated from subgenomic mRNAs in virions. Full-length antigenomic RNA was detected in LDV-infected macrophages by Northern hybridization at a level of < 1% of that of genomic RNA, but no negative polarity subgenomic RNAs. Negative complements to all subgenomic mRNAs, however, were detected by reverse transcription of total RNA from infected macrophages using as primer an oligonucleotide complementary to the antileader followed by polymerase chain reaction amplification using this sense primer in combination with various oligonucleotide primers complementary to a segment downstream of the junction between the 5' leader and the body of each subgenomic RNA. It is unclear whether these minute amounts of negative subgenomic RNAs function in the replication of the subgenomic mRNAs. They could also be by-products of the RNA replication process. Finally, no subgenomic mRNAs were detected in LDV virions.",1
"The large number of phenotypically distinct strains of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) provide a broad genetic background for examining naturally occurring coronavirus variation. Comparisons of the published nucleotide sequence of S1 genes of strains isolated in Europe, Japan and the USA and four additional American strains described in this report identified 4 genetically distinct groups. The Dutch group was the most divergent sharing only about 60% identity with the American, Mass and European groups which were about 80% homologous with each other. Whereas the strains within the Mass, European and Dutch strains were at least 95% homologous, the strains within the American group were most variable, sharing about 80% identity. The hypervariable region (HVR) which tended to correlate with serotype extended from amino acid residue 53 to 148. In addition to the previously described putative recombination events in the S1 gene of PP14 and SE17, we have now described similar shifts in homology in the corresponding gene of the Gray, Holte, 6/82 (European strain), and Iowa strains. Although minor cross-over sites were identified in the more conserved 3' end at approximately nt 1000 and 1400, a frequently used hot-spot for recombination extended from nt 25 to a region immediately upstream of, but not including, the hypervariable region (HVR). In addition to point mutations, deletions, and insertions, recombination often involving Mass-like and Ark-like sequences, is a commonly used mechanism responsible for the evolution of IBV.",1
"Members of the Bunyaviridae family acquire their envelopes by budding into the Golgi complex (GC). The accumulation of the membrane glycoproteins G1 and G2 in the GC probably determines the site of maturation. Here we have studied the intracellular transport and targeting to the GC of G1 and G2 of Uukuniemi virus, a member of the Phlebovirus genus, and report on their expression from cloned cDNAs either together or separately by using a T7 RNA polymerase-driven vaccinia virus expression system. When G1 and G2 were expressed together from a full-length cDNA as the p110 precursor, both proteins were localized to the Golgi complex, as evidenced by colocalization with the Golgi marker enzyme mannosidase II. Immunofluorescent staining indicated that G1 expressed alone also localized to the GC. However, pulse-chase experiments showed that G1 remained endoglycosidase H sensitive. G2 expressed alone remained associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). G2 could be rescued from the ER and transported to the GC by coexpression with G1 from separate mRNAs. Coexpression also increased the efficiency of G1 transport to the GC. With none of the constructs could the glycoproteins be observed on the cell surface. These results show that efficient export of G1 and G2 from the ER requires coexpression of both proteins, in conformity with our previous results showing that G1 and G2 from heterodimeric complexes in the ER. Since G1 expressed alone is retained in the GC, we conclude that G1 contains a retention signal for localization to the GC. G2 might thus become associated with the GC indirectly via its interaction with G1.",1
"The phosphoprotein (P) gene of two subgroup A strains of avian pneumovirus comprised 855 nucleotides containing only one substantial open reading frame encoding a protein of 278 amino acids, with a predicted M r of 30,323. In vitro translation of P mRNA in a wheat germ system resulted in the synthesis of two polypeptides of M r 35,000 Comparison of the deduced P protein sequence with that of the known mammalian pneumoviruses revealed overall amino acid identities ranging from 31 to 34.5%, suggesting a distant relationship. However, there was a much higher identity (63.2–68.4%) in a region of 57 residues, which included a heptad repeat sequence.",1
"The nucleotide sequence (8396 nucleotides) was determined, from the 3′-end of the putative polymerase gene to the poly(A) tail, for a Taiwanese virulent isolate, TFI, of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). The TFI nucleotide sequence had very high identity to the British virulent field isolate FS772/70 (98.3%), the attenuated Purdue 115 (96.7%) and from the S gene to ORF-4 gene region, to the low passaged virulent Miller (98.3%) strains of TGEV. Comparison of the TFI S protein sequence with those determined from other TGEV strains and those of the TGEV variant, porcine respiratory coronavirus, isolated from Europe and North America showed that they had changed very little over a period of 4 decades. The two extra amino acids found to be present in the spike proteins of the virulent FS772/70 and Miller strains when compared to the avirulent Purdue strain were found to be present in the TFI strain. The genomic organisation of the TFI strain was the same as that of the other TGEV viruses.",1
"We isolated a replication-competent, neurotropic retrovirus (FrC6 virus) and its molecular clone A8 from the NB-tropic Friend murine leukemia virus (FLV) complex. For detection and characterization of the FrC6 and A8 viruses, monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against the FLV complex were established. Thirty MAbs, each of which reacted with the FLV-producing cell line, were tested for potential neutralizing activities; only two MAbs inhibited the proliferation of the A8 virus. These two MAbs were ineffective or had very weak neutralizing activities toward the non-neurotropic FLV strain clone 57 virus. Further characterization of MAbs by immunoprecipitation revealed that 4 MAbs recognized the envelope protein of the A8 virus. Two of these 4 MAbs recognized the surface glycoprotein gp70, requiring the conformational epitope of the virus for this recognition, while the other two MAbs, which were reactive with the transmembrane protein p15E, were conformation-independent Both of the MAbs against gp70 distinguished neuropathogenic and non-neuropathogenic viruses to some extent, through neutralizing activity or binding activity detected by immunoprecipitation, whereas the two MAbs against p15E reacted with the viruses in a similar manner. Furthermore, one of the MAbs distinguished the viral antigen in the wall of the vacuolation that composes the spongiotic lesion induced by FrC6 viral infection of the brain.",1
"A set of degenerate sense and antisense primers were designed on the basis of short segments with identical amino acids in the predicted ORF 1b replicase proteins of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), equine arteritis virus (EAV) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, strain Lelystad virus (PRRSV-LV), which are members of a new group of positive-strand RNA viruses. Reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction amplification using this set of degenerate primers yielded products of the expected size from the genomes of all three viruses. It also yielded a product of appropriate size from the genome of another strain of PRRSV (VR2332), the ORF 1b sequence of which is unknown, but the 3′ end of the genome of which differs from that of the PRRSV-LV genome by about 50%. No products were generated from the genome of simian hemorhagic fever virus (SHFV), another member of this virus group. However, an appropriate product was generated with a second set of degenerate primers which was designed from the same ORF 1b segments of LDV, EAV and PRRSV-LV as the first set but on the basis of human codon preferences. Sequence analysis showed that the amplified SHFV ORF 1b segment exhibited about 50% nucleotide identity with the corresponding segments of ORF 1b of LDV, EAV and PRRSV. The results show that these and other degenerate primer sets might be useful for the search of related viruses in other mammalian species.",1
"A series of recombinant fusion proteins derived from equine arteritis virus (EAV) open reading frame (ORF) 7 have been used to define the immunoreactive region of the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein. Reactivities of recombinant N fusion proteins with post-infection equine sera in immunoblots and ELISAs indicate that the major nucleocapsid protein epitope is located within amino acid residues 1–69. In ELISAs two recombinant nucleocapsid fusion proteins containing residues 1–69 (rN1–69) and 1–28 (rN1–28) discriminated between pre- and post-infection, and pre- and post-vaccination serum samples. Additionally rN1–69 and rN1–28 detected seroconversions following vaccination with a killed virus preparation, even in the absence of a detectable virus neutralising response. Although a good correlation existed between virus neutralising antibody and rN1–69 ELISA positive values in post-infection sera, all the rN proteins failed to induce any virus neutralising response in immunised rabbits.",1
"The coronavirus spike glycoprotein (S) mediates both the attachment of virus to the host cell receptor and membrane fusion. We describe here the characterization of a temperature-sensitive mutant of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus A59 (MHV-A59) having multiple S protein-related defects. The most remarkable of these was that the mutant, designated Albany 18 (Alb 18), assembled virions devoid of the S glycoprotein at the nonpermissive temperature. Alb18 also failed to bring about syncytia formation in cells infected at the nonpermissive temperature. Virions of the mutant assembled at the permissive temperature were much more thermolabile than wild type. Moreover, mutant S protein that was incorporated into virions at the permissive temperature showed enhanced pH-dependent thermolability in its ability to bind to the MHV receptor. Alb18 was found to have a single point mutation in S resulting in a change of serine 287 to isoleucine, and it was shown by revertant analysis that this was the lesion responsible for the phenotype of the mutant.",1
"Brefeldin A (BFA), a unique fungal metabolite of a 13-membered lactone ring, exhibits various biological actions, including antitumor, antifungal and antiviral activities. In the present study, mouse LB cells were treated with various concentrations of interferon (IFN) and/or BFA overnight and infected with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) after removal of IFN and BFA. Doses of BFA which neither inhibit the metabolism of the cell nor the infectivity of EMCV, decreased the IFN-induced antiviral activity against EMCV as demonstrated by virus titer from supernatants. Since 2–5A synthetase and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase (PKR) have been suggested to be involved in the antiviral action of IFN against EMCV, their activities were investigated in LB cells after BFA treatment. Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization showed a decrease (2–3-fold) in the mRNA of 2′–5′ oligoadenylate (2–5A) synthetase after BFA treatment. BFA also inhibited the activity of 2–5A synthetase, 2–5A dependent RNase and phosphorylation of PKR in cellular extracts, indicating that BFA may be exerting its inhibitory effect both at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. This study reports a new biological action of BFA, demonstrating that BFA antagonized the antiviral action of IFN by inhibiting IFN-induced enzymatic pathways. These studies also suggest that both 2–5A and PKR are important in the antiviral activity of IFN against EMCV.",1
"Antigenic site D from the spike protein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), which is a continuous epitope critical in neutralization, has been expressed as a fusion protein with E. coli heat-labile toxin B subunit (LT-B) in attenuated S. typhimurium. Synthetic peptides containing the sequence of site D induced TGEB neutralizing antibodies when inoculated subcutaneously in both rabbits and swine. A synthetic oligonucleotide encoding residues 373–398 of TGEV S protein, including antigenic site D, was cloned in frame with the 3′ end of LT-B gene, into a plasmid used to transform S. typhimurium Δasd χ3730. A collection of 6 recombinant plasmids designated pYALTB-D I–VI encoding LTB-site D fusions with a variable number of site D sequences were selected. Four of the 6 LTB-site D fusion products expressed in S. typhimurium χ3730 formed oligomers (pentamers) that dissociated at > 70°. S. typhimurium χ3730 (pYALTB-D) V and VI expressed the oligomer forming products with higher antigenicity. Partially purified LTB-site D fusion product expressed from S. typhimurium χ3730 (pYALTB-D) V induced anti-TGEV neutralizing antibodies in rabbits. Recombinant vaccine strain S. typhimurium Δcya ΔcrpΔasd χ 3987 transformed with plasmid pYALTB-D V expressed constitutively products that formed oligomers presumably containing 20 copies of site D, and showed a high stability in vitro. This recombinant strain was orally inoculated in rabbits and induced TGEV specific antibodies in both serum and intestinal secretion.",1
"Rat coronaviruses (RCVs) infect laboratory rats and confound biomedical research results. In vitro systems developed so far have limited the growth in knowledge about RCVs by not permitting generation of plaque-cloned virus stocks, reliable isolation of RCVs from rat tissues, or growth of high titered stocks of all isolates. Due to the fact that less than 20% of L2(Percy) cells were becoming infected, sublines were produced and selected for maximal growth of RCVs. Screening of 238 cell sublines yielded L2p.176 cells which were highly susceptible to all RCVs tested; however, susceptibility declined after 30 passages in vitro. Low-passaged L2p.176 cells were used to isolate virus from natural outbreaks and to propagate individual RCV plaques into high titered stocks. Proteins from six RCV isolates were immunoblotted using polyclonal rat and mouse antibodies to sialodacryoadenitis virus and polyclonal monospecific rabbit and goat antibodies against the peplomer (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Proteins of two prototype, one Japanese and three wild type RCVs were examined and found to be similar to those of MHV, although the exact sizes and ratios of protein forms were unique for most RCV isolats. This study reports the development of a continuous cell line which reliably supports RCVs opening an opportunity for further in vivo studies of the biology of these agents. As a first step in the characterization of RCVs, we have shown that RCV proteins are very similar to those of MHV.",1
"The open reading frame 2 (ORF2) of three laboratory strains, the live attenuated vaccine virus, and 18 field isolates of equine arteritis virus (EAV) from Europe and North America was sequenced. The ORF2 of EAV encodes the Gs protein that is abundantly expressed in infected cells but constitutes less than 2% of the virion protein mass. Variation of ORF2 among the isolates facilitated phylogenetic analysis that largely confirmed results of an earlier study based on sequence divergence of ORF5 of the same isolates of EAV, despite exposure of the proteins encoded by ORF2 (Gs) and ORF5 (GL) to potentially different selective pressures in vivo. The data indicate that the Gs protein is highly conserved between isolates, considerably more so than the GL protein, consistent with an important role of the Gs protein in virus replication.",1
"Intraperitoneal inoculation into sensitive BALB/c mice of D85, a thermosensitive (ts) mutant, provokes acute hepatitis followed by recovery of the mice. The ts mutant was able to replicate in the liver. However, the maximal viral titre was obtained 2 days later than was the case with the wild-type (wt) MHV 3 infection; the viral antigens remained localized within small foci and no invasion of the entire liver was observed. The hepatocytes infected with D85 showed strong steatosis similar to that induced by wt virus, but the other lesions induced by MHV 3 (closing of endothelial cell fenestrae and hepatocytolysis) were not seen. An important feature noticed with the D85 mutant concerned the establishment, in the surviving animals, of persistent infection: this phenomenon was demonstrated by the decrease of viral titre in the liver, viral RNA detection, and the fact that viral antigens gradually decreased until the 3rd month post-infection.",1
"In trypanosomes, a single transcription unit usually covers several protein-coding genes. The primary transcript is cut up by trans-splicing and polyadenylation machineries to generate individual mature mRNAs. All nuclear mRNAs acquire the same capped 39 nucleotide sequence at their 5′ end as a consequence of the trans-splicing event. Trans splicing is used in the synthesis of some mRNAs in nematodes and chloroplats. These unusual systems are clearly related to cis-splicing systems, but it remains an intriguing question whether they are merely exotic offshoots of cis splicing or archaic remnants of cis-splicing progenitors.",1
"The wide variety of RNA viruses, and the diseases associated with them, may result in part from the capacity of RNA genomes to evolve through genetic recombination. Here we address the mechanism of RNA recombination, and ask questions about its prevalence and purpose in nature.",1
"Viruses are infectious agents capable of packaging and delivering nucleic acids and proteins to specific populations of cells. To initiate infection, viruses bind to sites, or receptors, on the cell surface and transfer their genome across the limiting membrane of the cell. The mechanisms underlying these events, and viral tropism for particular host cells, are becoming increasingly well understood. Several cell surface proteins have now been identified as viral receptors, and analyses of intact virus particles and sub-viral components are revealing the structures of the binding determinants on the viruses themselves. For many viruses, the events leading to penetration and delivery involve constitutive endocytic properties of the host cell, and the low pH environment in endocytic compartments is a crucial trigger in the penetration process. The knowledge of viral tropism, binding and entry suggests strategies which may be applied to the design of targeted therapeutic agents with appropriate specificities and effective delivery mechanisms.",1
"The rational design of effective oral vaccines based on synthetic peptides is a very ambitious undertaking, and involves the solution of huge problems related to protection of the antigens against degradation in the alimentary tract, efficient uptake of the antigens by the relevant cells, and efficient induction of long lasting systemic immunity, local immunity, or both. This paper summarises the steps, necessary to develop such synthetic oral vaccines. These steps involve: (1) the definition of B-cell epitopes; (2) the definition of T-cell epitopes; (3) definition of the carrier or backbone molecule; (4) definition of an immunomodulating element; (5) definition of an adjuvant element; and (6) definition of a targeting element. Good progress is being made with respect to the first three steps, the other steps still provide major challenges, notably the definition of targeting elements. Nevertheless, the first synthetic oral vaccines may become reality in the near future, depending on the speed by which new technology in the area of molecular recognition will develop, i.e. the appropriate chemistry, organic chemistry, molecular modelling, resolution of the molecular interaction of key molecules in microbiology and immunology.",1
"To ask what is new in Entamoeba histolytica research, one need look no further than the surface of this protozoan parasite. In the past year the cloning and partial characterization of five different surface antigens have been reported, a remarkable result of international research efforts against amebiosis. One of these proteins is the first protective immunogen identified in the animal model of amebic liver abscess. Barbara Mann and William Petri review these recent results, propose a nomenclature for the gene family of E. histolytica galactose lectins and discuss the roles of the different surface proteins in adhesion.",1
"The importance of infectious disease in the survival and adaptation of animal populations is rapidly becoming apparent. Throughout evolution, animal species have been continually afflicted with devastating disease outbreaks which have influenced the demographic and genetic status of the populations. Some general population consequences of such epidemics include selection for disease resistance, the occasional alteration of host gene frequencies by a genetic ‘founder effect’ after an outbreak, and genetic adaptation of parasites to abrogate host defense mechanisms. A wide variety of host cellular genes which are polymorphic within species and which confer a regulatory effect on the outcome of infectious diseases has recently been discovered. The critical importance of maintaining genetic diversity with respect to disease defense genes in natural populations is indicated by certain populations which have reduced genetic variability and apparent increased vulnerability to infectious disease.",1
"During late December 1989 and early January 1990, a cluster of six unexplained deaths occurred on a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) among children with congenital heart disease who had undergone cardiac surgical procedures. The children were all aged three years or less. In each case death was preceded by an unexpected increase in ventilatory pressure requirement followed by the development of a similar pulmonary shadowing on chest radiography. The radiological abnormality was felt to be consistent with a pneumonitis associated with some small airway disease. The clustering of these deaths, occurring in a similar unusual manner, was felt to constitute an outbreak warranting investigation. An Incident Committee was established to plan and manage a large multidisciplinary investigation during which the unit was temporarily closed. Following extensive investigation no bacterium, virus, fungus or other pathogen, toxic agent, or any other explanation for the cluster of deaths could be found. The possibility that the cluster occurred by chance remains although this was felt to be unlikely.",1
"One hundred endoscopes used for bronchoscopy (30), gastroscopy (35) or colonoscopy (35) were studied to determine the efficiency of a new high level disinfectant, orthophthalaldehyde (OPA). Manual cleaning was the method studied since this would be the least effective and thereby provide the greatest challenge to the 0·5% ( w v ) OPA solution. The OPA was convenient and easy to use since it did not have irritating vapours and as it is used directly, does not require dilution. Our study demonstrated that the OPA was stable for up to 14 days despite repeated re-use. The cleaning/ disinfection procedure could achieve a ⩾5 LOG10 reduction in bacterial load. This in-hospital evaluation supports the conclusion that OPA is an effective choice as a high level disinfectant for flexible endoscopes.",1
"Nedocromil sodium is a mast-cell stabilizer that prevents or ablates both the acute and late phases of the allergic response. It is an antiinflammatory agent that is not a steroid. It is more potent than the currently available mastcell stabilizer, cromolyn, and maintenance therapy may be possible at less frequent intervals than the initially recommended regimen of 4 times daily. Nedocromil for pulmonary administration is currently available. The nasal form has undergone clinical trials but has not yet been released in the United States.",1
"This article has presented a rational protocol for examining stools for enteric pathogens. When modified according to a laboratory's geographical location and patient population, this approach should allow efficient, comprehensive diagnosis of diarrheal disease. Laboratories should be able to examine stools routinely for Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Y. enterocolitica, intestinal parasites [including Cryptosporidium (14)], rotavirus, and C. difficile toxin. When unusual organisms such as pathogenic E. coli are suspected, or tissue culture facilities for C. difficile toxin assays are unavailable, the use of reference laboratories is strongly encouraged.",1
"This paper is the sixteenth installment of our annual review of research concerning the opiate system. It is restricted to papers published during 1993 that concern the behavioral effects of the endogenous opiate peptides, and does not include papers dealing only with their analgesic properties. The specific topics this year include stress; tolerance and dependence; eating; drinking; gastrointestinal, renal, and hepatic function; mental illness and mood; learning, memory, and reward; cardiovascular responses; respiration and thermoregulation; seizures and other neurological disorders; electrical-related activity; general activity and locomotion; development; immunological responses; and other behaviors.",1
"The distribution of phosphatidylcholine between inner and outer monolayers of rat brain synaptic plasma membrane was investigated by means of a phosphatidylcholine specific exchange protein. About 70% of the total membranal phosphatidylcholine was in the outer leaflet, 33% of which was exposed and readily exchanged in intact synaptosomes while the remainder was exchangeable following osmotic shock. Permeabilization of the synaptic plasma membranes by overnight incubation in buffer or by saponin (<0.08%) exposed an additional 30% of phosphatidylcholine to exchange, presumably from the inner cytoplasmic leaflet. Phosphatidylcholine is therefore asymmetrically distributed in the synaptosomal plasma membrane, as it is in other plasma membranes.",1
"—Aging-related changes in several structural characteristics of the main olfactory bulb (MOB) were evaluated using Fischer 344 rats 3, 18, 30 or 36 months of age. Histological examination of the nasal mucosa revealed no evidence of concurrent rhinitis in any of the animals studied. The internal granular layer of the MOB exhibited continual growth, increasing in volume by a factor of 63% over the range of ages studied. The sizes of MOB mitral cell perikarya and nuclei, expressed either as observed cross-sectional areas or as estimated mean volumes, did not change significantly as a function of age. The numbers of mitral cells exhibiting 2 nucleoli in the plane of section decreased from about 22% in the youngest animals to about 4% in the 18- and 30-month old animals and to nil in the oldest animals. These results are discussed in relation to findings of other investigators using Sprague-Dawley or Wistar rats. It is concluded that major structural age changes in the rat MOB are strain dependent.",1
"Characterization of the microbiological status is an important facet of a quality assurance program for laboratory animals. This paper addresses basic issues with regard to standardization of the characterization of murine viral status. Methods for such characterization include clinical signs, virus isolation, and serological tests. Significant considerations are screening profiles; sample collection, processing, and s shipment; and sampling schedules. International standardization of programs and methods to control and characterize the microbiological status of laboratory animals is being developed, and will be highly significant in future efforts to produce, control, and maintain laboratory animals free of viral infections.",1
"Our purpose was to investigate possible interrelations between antibody titers against seven viruses (measles, rubella, herpes simplex, mumps, varicella-zoster, coronavirus, cytomegalovirus), HLA-class II antigens, and immunoglobulin Gm allotypes in multiple sclerosis (MS). We studied 57 MS patients and 59 controls with similar age and sex distributions. In MS patients, we found the classical increased frequency of HLA-DR2, HLA-DQw1 and also an excess of Gm (3; ±23; 5*). Mumps antibody levels were higher in MS patients than in controls; elevation was not significant for measles antibodies. Analysis suggests that an association between HLA-DQwl and antibody titers against various viruses exists in controls but is absent in MS patients. In particular, we found that mumps antibody titers were higher in DQwl-positive than in DQwl-negative controls, while there was no significant difference among MS cases. Accordingly, we found that the overall difference between patients and controls was due to the fact that DQwl-positive patients had higher titers than controls, while DQwl-negative cases had similar titers as controls. These findings suggest that biological and molecular characteristics of DQwl might differ in MS patients.",1
"A CTL antigenic site located between residues 273 and 291 of the E1 envelope protein of RV was identified by 51Cr-release assays employing SPs. Two E1-specific CTL clones were examined for immune recognition of RV wild-type and attenuated vaccine strains and recombinant E1 protein. The exact sequence (273–284) recognized by both clones was delineated by using truncated and overlapping SPs covering these residues. The defined T-cell site overlapped almost completely with a virus neutralizing antibody-binding site previously identified with mouse monoclonal and human antibodies. A series of single aa-substituted SP analogues of E1(273–284) was used to define residues critical for T-cell recognition. Using EBV-Bl displaying different HLA-DR haplotypes and -DR4 subtypes as targets to determine MHC class II restriction elements, immune recognition by both T-cell clones was shown to be associated with HLA-DR4. Three HLA-DR4 subtypes (DR4Dw 13A, DR4Dw13B, and DR4KT2) sharing a common residue, glutamic acid at position 74 in their β 1 chains, were able to present SP E1(273–284) to the T-cell clones.",1
"A recent development in the production of experimental vaccines has been the use of the smallpox vaccine virus (vaccinia virus) as a carrier (vector) of the genes (immunogenes) which code for the protection-inducing proteins (immunogens) of unrelated viruses. The potential of these vector vaccines lies in the hope that such a vaccine would be cheaper, safer and/or more effective than existing vaccines to some pathogens. Vaccinia virus as a vector has attracted most attention to date because: (a) several immunogenes can be inserted into its genome without destroying its infectivity; (b) the immunogens appear to be produced normally; (c) vaccinia virus has been used highly successfully to eradicate smallpox; and (d) it has a wide host-range and thus might find veterinary as well as human medical application. Experimental vaccines, successfully tested in animals, have been prepared using immunogenes from influenza virus, hepatitis B virus and herpes simplex virus. Apathogenic enteric bacteria have some potential as vectors, most probably against enteric pathogens, although the potential of viral vectors is likely to be realized first. Parasitic worms and protozoa devastate millions of people. When the immunogens of these organisms have been identified there will be added impetus to investigate the potential of vector vaccines against these pathogens.",1
"Viral recognition of specific receptors in the host cell plasma membrane is the first step in virus infection. Attachment is followed by a redistribution or capping of virus particles on the cell surface which may play a role in the uptake process. Certain viruses penetrate the plasma membrane directly but many, both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, are endocytosed at coated pits and subsequently pass into endosomes. The low pH environment of the endosome facilitates passage of the viral genome into the cytoplasm. For some viruses the mechanism of membrane penetration is now known to be linked to a pH-mediated conformational change in external virion proteins. As a consequence of infection there are alterations in the permeability of the plasma membrane which may contribute to cellular damage. Recent advances in the understanding of these processes are reviewed and their relevance to the development of new strategies for vaccines emphasised.",1
"Respiratory disease is one of the most serious disease complexes affecting beef cattle production. For example, it is claimed to cost the UK industry about £70 million per year. It is usually associated with young cattle and can occur in a variety of situations. It is a good example of multifactorial disease in that its aetiology involves both infection by a variety of microorganisms and a number of environmental factors. Several distinct syndromes occur and a number of microorganisms are thought to be important including the bacteria Pasteurella haemolytica type A1, P. multocida, Haemophilus somnus, Corynebacterium pyogenes, Mycoplasma bovis and M. dispar. Of the viruses, bovine herpes virus 1 (BHV1) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are known to be important, the former also causing the specific syndrome, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) in addition to its involvement in the pneumonia complex. Other viruses of possible importance include para-influenza 3 (Pi3), adenoviruses, bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) virus, coronavirus and rhinovirus.",1
"In preceding studies by the author, use of the immunomodulator drug diethylcarbamazine resulted in the detection of antibodies to feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen in nine feline leukaemia virus infected cats that had previously given negative results to this antibody. In the present report, seven diethylcarbamazine-treated cats developed higher serum antibody titres to feline infectious peritonitis more frequently than did seven untreated controls. Since feline infectious peritonitis is caused by a coronavirus, these results suggest that diethylcarbamazine treatment could be exploited for vaccination and treatment strategies for non-retroviral in addition to retroviral infections.",1
"We have assessed the potency of an inactivated oil-adjuvanted rotavirus vaccine in beef herds in Argentina. Two different vaccine trials were conducted. In a small-scale experimental trial, involving 21 pregnant cows (13 vaccinated and eight unvaccinated controls), a significant increase in neutralizing antibody titres against different serotypes of bovine rotaviruses was found in both the colostrum and serum of vaccinated cows compared with that of unvaccinated controls. Seven days after birth, half of the calves born to vaccinated dams or to control cows were challenged with live virulent virus whereas the other half of both groups were left in contact with the infected calves in order to mimic a natural field challenge. Although no statistically significant differences in the rate of protection were observed among the different groups of animals, a larger number of vaccinated calves were protected in comparison with their controls, particularly where animals in contact with infected calves were concerned. Secondly, a large-scale field trial was carried out in 17 beef herds involving a total of 4066 vaccinated pregnant cows. In 11 farms morbidity and mortality in calves from vaccinated cows were compared with historical data from the previous 3 years at the same locations. In the other six herds, control groups were used to compare data of the same year: 1540 cows were vaccinated and 2700 were left as controls. Taking into account the previous and current incidence of diarrhoea, morbidity and mortality were significantly reduced in 16 of the 17 beef herds tested. Vaccine effectiveness was also evident in farms where other enteropathogens such as cryptosporidium and coronaviruses were present, together with rotavirus.",1
"Cats vaccinated intranasally (i.n.) with a temperature sensitive feline infectious peritonitis virus (ts-FIPV) vaccine were protected against an FIP-inducing challenge. Seventeen of 20 vaccinated cats (85%) survived a rigorous virulent FIPV challenge that caused FIP in 12 of 12 non-vaccinated cats (100%), 10 (83%) of which died. Intranasal vaccination stimulated serum IgG and serum and salivary IgA antibody responses (measured by ELISA), FIPV-neutralizing antibody (VN), and a cell-mediated immune (CMI) response as measured by lymphocyte proliferation. The serum antibody response to vaccination was not associated with protection. In fact, the IgG, IgA and VN titres were much higher in control cats than in vaccinated cats following challenge suggesting an immune-mediated pathogenesis. In contrast, stimulation of a mucosal IgA response to vaccination was related to protection. The in vitro proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes in response to virulent FIPV was observed in vaccinated cats, in vaccinated and challenged cats but not in non-vaccinated challenged cats.",1
"Under laboratory conditions coronaviruses were shown to have a high frequency of recombination. In The Netherlands, vaccination against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is performed with vaccines that contain several life-attenuated virus strains. These highly effective vaccines may create ideal conditions for recombination, and could therefore be dangerous in the long term. This paper addresses the question of the frequency of recombination of avian coronavirus IBV in the field. A method was sought to detect and quantify recombination from sequence data. Nucleotide sequences of eight IBV isolates in a region of the genome suspected to contain recombination, were aligned and compared. Phylogenetic trees were constructed for different sections of this region. Differences in topology between these trees were observed, suggesting that in three out of eight strains in vivo RNA recombinant had occurred.",1
"Immune responses to the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) nucleocapsid protein were studied using a recombinant-DNA expression product. In mice, a lymphocyte proliferative response and a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to IBV were induced upon immunization with this nucleocapsid protein. Next, we studied the role of the expressed nucleocapsid protein in induction of a protective immune response to IBV in chickens. Chickens were primed with nucleocapsid protein and subsequently boosted with inactivated IBV, strain M41. Proliferative responses of blood mononuclear cells corresponded with increased mean haemagglutination inhibition and virus neutralization titres. Finally, an increased tracheal protection against challenge with live IBV was observed. These results indicate that infectious bronchitis virus nucleocapsid protein is a relevant target for immune recognition in both the mouse and the chicken.",1
"Fimbrial vaccines are routinely given parenterally to pregnant cattle, sheep and swine to protect suckling newborn calves, lambs and pigs against enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) infections. Such vaccines are practical and effective because (1) most fatal ETEC infections in farm animals occur in the early neonatal period when the antibody titres in colostrum and milk are highest; (2) more than 90% of the ETEC in farm animals belong to a small family of fimbrial antigen types: (3) fimbriae consist of good protein antigens on the bacterial surface where they are readily accessible to antibody; (4) fimbriae are required for a critical step (adhesion-colonization) early in the pathogenesis of the disease. ETEC infections continue to be a significant clinical problem in farm animals in spite of extensive use of fimbriae-based vaccines. Definitive data on the efficacy of the commercial vaccines in field use are not available. The prevailing perception among animal health professionals is that the vaccines are effective, that the problem occurs chiefly among non-vaccinated animals, and that in some herds vaccination moves peak prevalence of disease from the first to the second or third week after birth, when mortality is lower. It has been suggested that extensive use of vaccines will rapidly select for the emergence of novel or previously low prevalence fimbrial antigen types. There is no evidence that this has happened after a decade of routine vaccine use in the United States. However, there is no active direct surveillance for such emergence. In contrast to the rational development of vaccines to provide passive lacteal protection against ETEC in suckling neonates, comparatively little progress has been made in providing the knowledge required for development of vaccines to protect against postweaning ETEC infections in swine.",1
"An infection of pigs with the porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) induces antibodies which neutralize the enteropathogenic transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and PRCV to the same titre. In the present study, 10-week-old seronegative pigs (n = 8), pigs immune following TGEV inoculation (n = 4) or pigs immune following aerosol (n = 8) or intragastric inoculation (n = 4) with PRCV were challenged with TGEV. Whereas TGEV-immune pigs were completely protected against challenge, all PRCV-immune pigs showed serological evidence of TGEV replication. Nevertheless, the aerosol or intragastric inoculation with PRCV primed the humoral immune system against TGEV and the TGEV challenge induced a secondary antibody response in most PRCV-immune pigs. Furthermore, all PRCV-immune pigs showed a decrease in the duration of the excretion of infectious TGEV (0–4 days) in comparison with the duration of the virus excretion by seronegative pigs (5–6 days).",1
"Passive immunization of mice with 131 μg of the non-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) 18A2B2, directed against the A subgroup epitope of the G glycoprotein of respiratory syncytial virus Long strain (RSV), confers protection against viral i.n. challenge. The role of the Fc fragment of this antibody as well as the involvement of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-mediated cytolysis towards protection was evaluated in vivo. Passive immunization with the Fab fragment alone (618–907 μg mouse−1) was unable to confer protection in mice. Furthermore, we passively immunized with the mAb 18A2B2 SCID beige mice, which are deficient in natural killer (NK) cell activity, to ascertain the role of NK cells in the protective mechanism. These mice were free of virus 5 days following viral challenge, indicating that NK cells do not contribute significantly towards the protective action of this antibody. Moreover, passively immunized BALB c mice decomplemented with 8–10 U of cobra venom factor (CoVF) and DBA 2J mice (C5 deficient) were only partially protected. These findings suggest that in mice the alternative and classical pathways of the complement system are involved in the passive protection mechanism conferred by the non-neutralizing mAb 18A2B2. To our knowledge, it is the first description of a protective mechanism in mice that involves a non-neutralizing antibody and the complement system.",1
"A rhesus rotavirus vaccine adjuvanted with ISCOMs was injected intramuscularly to 5 pregnant baboons, with repeated doses 1–2 and 14 weeks after delivery. Maternal blood and milk samples and blood samples from their babies were collected at 2-weekly intervals until 26 weeks after parturition. Samples were assayed for rotavirus antibodies by ELISAs and neutralisation tests. Vaccination produced statistically significant increases in maternal serum IgG and neutralising antibodies, and in milk IgA, IgG, and neutralising antibodies. Control baboon mothers sampled from 12 weeks after delivery had lower serum and milk antibody titres, but responded to vaccination at 16 weeks by producing a similar antibody profile in serum and milk to those previously vaccinated. Because of the endemic nature of human rotaviral infections, similar maternal vaccinations have potential as a means of increasing milk antibodies to a level at which they may be protective to infants.",1
"Aminopeptidases are a group of enzymes found on the cell surface and in the cytoplasmic compartments of many peripheral blood cell types and their progenitors. Their functional roles include the hydrolysis of several biologically active peptides and growth factors and some have proved to be of diagnostic and prognostic value in leukaemia. These enzymes may also be found in serum as a consequence of non-haematopoietic related diseases and so have been used as indicators of liver damage. Haematopoietic cells in the bone marrow go through a process of growth and differentiation before being released into the peripheral circulation where they fulfill many functional roles. The enzyme activities of some aminopeptidases have been shown to modulate the growth of these cells. In addition, the activities of these enzymes themselves can be regulated by haematopoietic growth factors. However, the mechanisms that regulate their expression and activity are not fully understood. In this report the current literature has been reviewed for evidence of expression, regulation and clinical significance.",1
"Fenestrations of hepatic endothelial cells play an active role as a sieving barrier allowing extensive exchange between the blood and liver parenchyma. Alteration of these structures may be induced in the course of various pathological events and provoke important perturbations of liver function. We demonstrate here that sinusoidal endothelial cells are permissive for mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3) in vivo and in vitro and that this infection leads to a striking decrease in the number of fenestrae. The disappearance of these structures observed under scanning electron microscopy or in cryofracture preparations in vivo and in vitro cannot be reversed by the action of cytochalasin B on the microfilament network. The decrease in the porosity seems to be related directly to the productive infection of the endothelial cells, because it was not observed in A/J mice resistant to the virus and in susceptible BALB/c mice immunized with a thermosensitive mutant in which no viral replication occurs. In conclusion, a viral infection of liver endothelial cells may cause extensive loss of the fenestrations and thus lead to important functional pertubations.",1
"A long-term study was conducted to determine the possible chronic toxicity and oncogenicity of methylene chloride. Rats and hamsters were exposed by inhalation to 0, 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm of methylene chloride for 6 hr per day, 5 days a week, for 2 years. No exposure-related cytogenetic effects were present in male or female rats exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm. Females rats exposed to 3500 ppm had an increased mortality rate while female hamsters exposed to 1500 or 3500 ppm had decreased mortality rates. Carboxyhemoglobin values were elevated in rats and hamsters exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm with the percentage increase in hamsters greater than in rats. Minimal histopathologic effects were present in the livers of rats exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm. Decreased amyloidosis was observed in the liver and other organs in hamsters exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm. While the number of female rats with a benign tumor was not increased, the total number of benign mammary tumors was increased in female rats in an exposure-related manner. This effect was also evident in male rats in the 1500- and 3500-ppm exposure groups. Finally, male rats exposed to 1500 or 3500 ppm had an increased number of sercomas in the ventral neck region located in or around the salivary glands. Therefore, in this 2-year study, some effects were observed in male and female rats exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm of methylene chloride. In contrast, hamsters exposed to the same exposure concentrations had less extensive spontaneous geriatric changes, decreased mortality (females), and lacked evidence of definite target organ toxicity.",1
"Eight groups of 30 male and 30 female rats were exposed 1 hr per day, 5 days per week for 13 weeks, to smoke from reference (tobacco burned) or test (tobacco only heated) cigarettes, at nicotine concentrations of 5, 15, or 30 μg/liter of air. Similar smoke concentrations of wet total particulate matter and carbon monoxide were produced in each of the test/reference comparisons. There was a pronounced depression of minute ventilation of animals in the reference groups, but not in the test animals. Blood carboxyhemoglobin concentrations were similar in animals exposed to smoke from test and reference cigarettes. Plasma concentrations of nicotine and cotinine in the test groups were higher than in the reference groups. There were no differences between the smoke-exposed groups in terms of body weight or feed consumption. At necropsy, an increase in heart weight was noted in both high exposure groups. There were notable differences in histopathology, with fewer and less-pronounced changes in the test groups than in the reference groups. Many of the histopathological responses induced in the reference groups were absent in the test groups. Overall, the study demonstrated a substantial reduction in the biological activity of smoke from the test cigarette when compared with the reference.",1
"Azodicarbonamide (ADA), a compound used in the baking and plastics industries, has been reported to cause pulmonary sensitization and dermatitis in people. Two-week repeated and 13-week subchronic inhalation exposures of F344 N rats and B6C3F1 mice to ADA were conducted to determine the toxicity of inhaled ADA. The mean air concentrations of ADA in the 2-week studies were 207, 102, 52, 9.4, or 2.0 mg/m3. No exposure-related mortality nor abnormal clinical signs were observed in rats or mice during or after exposure. The terminal body weights were slightly depressed in the highest exposure group. Liver weights were lower in male rats exposed to 200 mg ADA/m3. No significant lesions were noted on either gross or histologic evaluation of rats or mice. In the 13-week subchronic study, the mean air concentrations of ADA were 204, 100, or 50 mg/m3. No mortality or clinical signs related to exposure were observed. The terminal body weights of exposed rats were not significantly different from those of control rats but were significantly depressed in mice exposed to 100 or 200 mg ADA/m3. No histopathological lesions were noted in mice. Lung weights were increased and enlarged mediastinal and/or tracheobronchial lymph nodes were noted in rats exposed to 50 mg ADA/m3. No exposure-related lesions were observed microscopically in rats exposed to 100 or 200 mg ADA/m3. All rats in the 50 mg DNA/m3 exposure group only had lung lesions that consisted of perivascular cuffing with lymphocytes and a multifocal type II cell hyperplasia, suggesting a possible immune reaction to an antigen in the lung. Viral titers for rats exposed to 50 mg ADA/m3 were negative for Sendai virus and pneumonia virus of mice, which produce similar lesions. The possibility of an unknown viral antigen causing this lesion cannot be eliminated. Lung tissue from male rats was analyzed for ADA and biurea, the major metabolite of ADA. No ADA was detected. The amount of biurea in the lungs increased nonlinearly with increasing exposure concentration, suggesting that clearance was somewhat impaired with repeated exposures. However, even at the highest exposure concentration, this amount of biurea was less than 1% of the estimated total ADA deposited over the exposure period. In summary, ADA is rapidly cleared from the lungs, even when inhaled at concentrations up to 200 mg/m3. Exposure to ADA for up to 13 weeks did not appear to be toxic to rodents.",1
"The chance that alternatives will completely replace animals for toxicology research in the foreseeable future is nil. Continual refinement of animal toxicity and carcinogenesis studies, however, can be an effective means of reducing the numbers of animals used and conserving time and resources without compromising scientific quality. We must continue to strive to find species and strains that can metabolize chemicals similar to humans, are small enough to be housed in large numbers, and have low prevalence of spontaneous lesions with sufficient life span to express the toxic and carcinogenic potential of chemicals. Adequate care of animals with control of variables such as light, temperature, diet, bedding, diseases, and genetic characters of laboratory animals will decrease the variability. Humane considerations and euthanasia of animals with large masses and other conditions interfering with eating and drinking, major injuries and ulcers related to husbandry and treatment, and diseases indicating pain and suffering will help not only to alleviate further pain and distress but also to facilitate collection of tissues without secondary complications for detection of chemical treatment-related lesions. Limiting the duration of studies to decrease the variability due to ageassociated changes will also refine long-term studies. Other considerations for refinement of carcinogenesis studies include selection of the most sensitive sex of one or more species for evaluation of selected chemicals in a class where toxic and carcinogenic potential of other representative chemicals are known. Genetically engineered animal models with known oncogenes may reduce the duration and increase the sensitivity of carcinogenesis studies with a reduction in the use of animals.",1
"Although ozone-induced epithelial injury in vivo has been morphologically characterized, effects of gaseous oxidants on respiratory epithelium in organ culture, where tissue organization is maintained but systemic influences are eliminated, have not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we exposed tracheal organ cultures from rats to 95% oxygen and 1 ppm ozone, alone and in combination, to determine (1) whether epithelial responses to ozone similar to those observed in vivo occur in airways separated from systemic physiologic, secretory, and inflammatory reactions; (2) whether concentrations of oxygen sufficient to potentially cause oxidant injury result in morphologic epithelial alterations similar to those that occur in ozone toxicity; and (3) if the combined oxidant insult of oxygen and ozone results in more severe damage to the tracheal epithelium than occurs with ozone in air. Tracheal organ cultures were exposed to filtered air and 5% carbon dioxide; filtered air, 5% carbon dioxide, and 1 ppm ozone; 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide; or 95% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide, and 1 ppm ozone for 96 hr. Light- and quantitative electron-microscopic evaluation showed that epithelia to 1 ppm ozone in air exhibited loss of ciliated cells and ciliated cell damage. The epithelia exposed to 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide were pseudostratified, columnar, ciliated, and hyperplastic. Epithelia exposed to 95% oxygen plus 1 ppm ozone were stratified and nonciliated or very sparsely ciliated. The predominant cell types in epithelia exposed to oxygen plus ozone were serous cells and metaplastic cells, and focal aggregates of adherent necrotic cells were present. We conclude that there was a synergism between oxygen and ozone exposure leading to enhanced epithelial injury and metaplasia.",1
"A study with multiple exposure groups and large group sizes was performed to establish whether exposure to 60-Hz electric fields would result in reproductive and developmental toxicity. A response model was developed from previous results and tested in groups of rats exposed to electric fields at various field strengths. Female rats were mated, and sperm-positive animals randomly distributed among four groups: sham-exposed or exposed to 10, 65, or 130 kV/m, 60-Hz vertical electric fields. Animals were exposed for 19 hr/day throughout the experiment. During gestation, exposure to the higher field strengths resulted in slightly depressed weight gains of dams. Offspring were born in the field and remained with their dams through the suckling period. Numbers of pups per litter and pup mortality did not differ among the exposure groups. Dams exposed at 65 kV/m lost slightly more weight through the lactation period than the control group. Male pups exposed to higher field strengths gained slightly less weight from 4 to 21 days of age than did sham-exposed animals. At weaning, two F1 females per litter (randomly selected) continued on the same exposure regimen were mated at 11 weeks of age to unexposed males, and euthanized at 20 days of gestation. Uterine contents were evaluated, and all liver fetuses were weighed and examined for external, visceral, and skeletal malformations. Fertility and gestational weight gain of F1 females were not affected by exposure, nor was prenatal viability or fetal body weight. No significant increase in the incidence of litters with malformations was observed. Although no developmental toxicity was detected, exposures produced physical changes in the dams, evidenced as a rust-colored deposit on the muzzle and ears (chromodacryorrhea) that increased in incidence and severity at 65 and 130 kV/m. Incidence of chromodacryorrhea was not significantly different between sham-exposed rats and those exposed at 10 kV/m.",1
"Ferrocene (dicyclopentadienyl iron; CAS No. 102-54-5) is a relatively volatile, organometallic compound used as a chemical intermediate, a catalyst, and as an antiknock additive in gasoline. It is of particular interest because of its structural similarities to other metallocenes that have been shown to be carcinogenic. F344 N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to 0, 2.5, 5.0, 10, 20, and 40 mg ferrocene vapor/m3, 6 hr/day for 2 weeks. During these exposures, there were no mortality and no observable clinical signs of ferrocene-related toxicity in any of the animals. At the end of the exposures, male rats exposed to the highest level of ferrocene had decreased body-weight gains relative to the weight gained by filtered air-exposed control rats, while body-weight gains for all groups of both ferrocene- and filtered air-exposed female rats were similar. Male mice exposed to the highest level of ferrocene also had decreased body-weight gains, relative to controls, while female mice had relative decreases in body-weight gains at the three highest exposure levels. Male rats had a slight decrease in relative liver weight at the highest level of exposure, whereas no relative differences in organ weights were seen in female rats. Male mice had exposure-relative decreases in liver and spleen weights, and an increase in thymus weights, relative to controls. For female mice, relative decreases in organ weights were seen for brain, liver, and spleen. No exposure-related gross lesions were seen in any of the rats or mice at necropsy. Histopathological examination was done only on the nasal turbinates, lungs, liver, and spleen. The only exposure-related finding was histopathologic lesions in the nasal turbinates of both species. These lesions were primarily centered in the olfactory epithelium and were morphologically diagnosed as subacute, necrotizing inflammation. Nasal lesions were observed in all ferrocene-exposed animals and differed only in severity, which was dependent on the exposure concentration. In vitro metabolism studies of ferrocene showed that nasal tissue, particularly the olfactory epithelium, had ∼ 10 times higher “ferrocene hydroxylating” activity than did liver tissue from the same animals. These results suggest that the mechanism of ferrocene toxicity may be the intracellular release of ferrous ion through ferrocene metabolism, followed by iron-catalyzed lipid peroxidation of cellular membranes.",1
"Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed 6 hr per day for 14 consecutive days to aged and diluted sidestream smoke (ADSS), used as a surrogate for Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS), at concentrations of 0.1 (typical), 1 (extreme), or 10 (exaggerated) mg of particulates per cubic meter. Animals were exposed nose-only, inside whole-body chambers, to ADSS from the 1R4F reference cigarette. End-points included histopathology, CO-oximetry, plasma nicotine and cotinine, clinical pathology, and organ and body weights. The only pathological response observed was slight to mild epithelial hyperplasia and inflammation in the most rostral part of the nasal cavity, in the high-exposure group only. No effects were noted at medium or low exposures. The minimal changes noted were reversible, using a subgroup of animals kept without further treatment for an additional 14 days. Overall, the end-points used in the study demonstrated that there was no detectable biological activity of ADSS at typical or even 10-fold ETS concentrations and that the activity was only minimal at very exaggerated concentrations (particle concentrations 100 times higher than typical real-world concentrations).",1
"Infections in children in day care are common, but can be limited by education of providers and staff in standards of hygiene, maintenance of basic techniques of infection control, appropriate use of the physical facilities of the day care unit, and maintenance of recommended levels of children and staff.",1
"Brown HT was fed to rats of both sexes over three generations at dietary concentrations designed to provide daily intakes of 0, 50, 250 and 500 mg Brown HT/kg body weight/day. During the study a number of females died or failed to nurse their litters. This was so severe following the first mating of F1 adults that the animals were remated to provide the next generation. None of these effects were related to treatment. Body weight and food and water intakes were not adversely affected by treatment. No effects of treatment were seen on reproductive performance or foetal and pup development, apart from slight evidence of a treatment-related retarded ossification of the third sternebrae. Organ weights at autopsy showed two changes, one of which was increased kidney weights which, although not present in every generation, seemed to be related to treatment. The other, increased caecum weights, occurred in adult high-dose females of early generations, but not in males or later generations of the study. Apart from brown coloration of tissues, macroscopic and microscopic examination revealed no treatment-related changes. It was concluded that the no-untoward-effect level in the present study was 250 mg Brown HT/kg/day.",1
"A battery of in vitro and in vivo tests were conducted on HCFC-141b as a vapour. Bacterial gene mutation assays with Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium were negative in all tester strains. In vitro chromosomal aberration assays were positive on CHO cells but negative on human lymphocytes. Moreover, HCFC-141b was negative in vivo in a mouse micronucleus inhalation assay. On the basis of these data and previously reported genotoxicity testing, HCFC-141b is considered non-genotoxic. Groups of 80 male and 80 female Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed, by inhalation (6 hr/day, 5 days/wk) to vapours of HCFC-141b for 104 wk at target concentrations of 0 (control), 1500, 5000 and 20,000 ppm (increased from 15,000 ppm after 17 wk of exposure). No exposure-related effects of toxicological significance were noted with respect to survival, clinical signs, ophthalmoscopy, haematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis or organ weight analysis. Reduced food intake and body weight gain were noted in both sexes of the 15,000 ppm group during the first 16 wk; thereafter, body weight gains in all groups were similar although the intergroup differences in body weight remained evident. Reduced food intake persisted in both sexes through wk 52 and in females during the second year of exposure. Treatment-related effects on macroscopic pathology were confined to increased incidences of testicular masses and altered appearance. Microscopic pathology examinations confirmed the testes as the target organ with findings of increased incidences of benign interstitial cell tumours and hyperplasia at 5000 and 20,000 ppm. The no-observable-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) was 1500 ppm. The testicular changes at high exposure levels were considered to be due to a change of the senile hormonal imbalance in geriatric rats and of little significance for the assessment of human health effects.",1
"The sequence of the 3′-most 8300 nucleotides of the genome RNA of the Purdue-115 strain of the transmissible gastroenteritis virus TGEV, a porcine coronavirus, was determined from cDNA clones. The available sequence corresponds to the part of the genome (total length > 20 kb) expressed through subgenomic mRNAs. The 5 subgenomic and the genomic RNA species detected in TGEV-infected cells form a 3′-coterminal ‘nested’ structure, a unique feature of Coronaviridae. The transcription initiation site of the TGEV subgenomic RNAs appears to involve the hexameric sequence 5′CTAAAC, which is present upstream from each coding region. In addition to the previously identified genes encoding the three structural proteins, E2, E1 and N, two regions, X1 and X2, corresponding to the non-overlapping portion of mRNAs 4 and 3, may code for so far unidentified non-structural polypeptides. The predicted X1 polypeptide (9.2 kDa) is highly hydrophobic. The sequence of the X2 region allows the translation of two non-ovelapping products, i.e., X2a (7.7 kDa).and x2b (18.8 kDa). No RNA species liable to express the extreme 3′ open reading frame X3 was found.",1
"It is possible to interfere with different steps in the dolichol pathway of protein glycosylation and in the processing of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. Thus some clues about the role of protein-bound carbohydrate can be obtained by comparing the biochemical fates and functions of glycosylated proteins with their non-glycosylated counterparts, or with proteins exhibiting differences in the type of oligosaccharide side chains. Cells infected with enveloped viruses are good systems for studying both aspects of protein glycosylation, since they contain a limited number of different glycoproteins, often with well-defined functions. Tunicamycin, and antibiotic, as well as several sugar analogues have been found to act as inhibitors of protein glycosylation by virtue of their anti-viral properties. They interfere with various steps in the dolichol pathway resulting in a lack of functional-linked oligosaccharide precursors. Compounds that interfere with oligosaccharide trimming represent a second generation of inhibitors of glycosylation. They are glycosidase inhibitors that interfere with the processing glucosidases and mannosidases and, as a result, the conversion of high-mannose into complex-type oligosaccharides is blocked. Depending upon the compound used, glycoproteins contain glucosylated-high-mannose, high-mannose or hybrid oligosaccharide structures instead of complex ones. The biological consequences of the alterations caused by the inhibitors are manifold: increased susceptibility to proteases, improper protein processing and misfolding of polypeptide chains, loss of biological activity and alteration of the site of virus-budding, to name but a few.",1
"The translation frame-monitoring mechanism has been suggested earlier, based on transient complementary contacts, between mRNA and rRNA. Recent studies related to the frame-monitoring mechanism are reviewed. The mechanism is well supported by both new experimental and sequence analysis data.

"The genomic RNA from turnip yellow mosaic virus presents a 3′-end functionally and structurally related to tRNAs. This report summarizes our knowledge about the peculiar structure of the tRNA-like domain and its interaction with tRNA specific proteins, like RNAse P, tRNA nucleotidyl-transferase, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, and elongation factors. It discusses also the biological role of this structure in the viral life cycle. A brief survey of our knowledge of other tRNA mimicries in biological systems, as well as their relevance for understanding canonical tRNA, will also be presented.",1
"The N-terminal 26 amino acids of the prohormone pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) were investigated to determine whether this region has the capacity to act as a sorting signal for the regulated secretory pathway. Constructs were made using the N-terminal 101, 50, 26 or 10 amino acids of POMC fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter protein and expressed in AtT20 cells to show that at least the first 26 amino acids were required to sort CAT to the regulated secretory pathway. Full length POMC was mutated by deleting amino acids 2–26 from the N-terminal region. Analysis of Neuro-2a cells expressing this mutation compared to wild type POMC indicated that these 26 amino acids contain information essential for sorting POMC to the regulated secretory pathway. The results presented here suggest the presence of a conformation-dependent signal in the N-terminal 26 amino acids of POMC responsible for sorting POMC to the regulated secretory pathway.",1

"Protection of calves against enteric and respiratory disorders is dependent on the passive immunity that the calf has received, its innate resistance to infection, the burden of infection in the environment and the nutrition of the calf. Superimposed on these, are the effects of management and physical environment. The plane of nutrition required for dairy heifers during rearing depends on the age at first calving, and for meat animals depends on the carcass weight and fat deposition required at a particular slaughter date in relation to time of birth.",1
"The hybridoma technology for production of monoclonal antibodies circumvents many of the constraints associated with the use of conventional antisera, and consequently broadens the areas of application of antibodies in animal sciences. In the present review, the potential usefulness of monoclonal antibodies in animal production - with emphasis on reproduction - is discussed, including the inherent limitations of the current technology and the improvements that can be foreseen within the next few years. Because of their unique specificity and the fact that they can be produced in virtually unlimited quantities, monoclonal antibodies are an important tool in diagnostics. However, the use of these antibodies does not always guarantee absolute specificity, and the low affinity of many monoclonal antibodies will impose a number of limitations on their use. Monoclonal antibodies can also be used to optimize physiological processes such as growth and reproduction. For this, homologous antibodies will probably offer several advantages over their murine counterparts in terms of effectiveness for passive immunization. Some success has already been achieved in the development of monoclonal antibodies from livestock species. Finally, it is shown that monoclonal antibodies are becoming extremely powerful research tools.",1
"A pilot epidemiological inquiry was undertaken in France in a group of 205 nucleus and multiplier pig farms. The aim was to find out a method for a quantitative evaluation of the health level in farms selling young breeders. An exhaustive protocol was prepared for data collection. The sources of information were clinical inspections on the farms, meat inspection data at slaughter and laboratory investigations. Data processing issued in the selection of a profile made of 14 prevailing health indicators. These were then associated so as to set up a health index with an overall score. In a second phase, the relevance of the method with respect to disease transmission was assessed. The principle was a contact challenge within totally controlled facilities between SPF pigs hysterectomy-derived and gilts taken from farms with different health scores as previously checked. The contact lasted for 28 days. Eleven farms were chosen and in every one of them 7 gilts were sampled and 10 SPF pigs were assigned to each of these farms. All the pigs were submitted to a detailed observation. At the end of it the pigs were euthanized at the laboratory and checked to find out any lesions and infectious agents. A wide range of symptoms appeared among the SPF pigs. Mortality rate was 14.6%. Pneumonia affected 23.7% of them. A relationship was found between the germ transfer and the severity of the troubles. The degree of illness in SPF pigs was clearly related to the score obtained previously in the corresponding farms. Consequently, the method was considered as valid with respect to health evaluation.",1
"This paper reviews how immunomodulation through active vaccination has evolved in the past 25 years. Although initially it progressed isolated from the main stream of immunological research and vaccine development, lately it merged with this main stream and is taking full advantage of the newest developments in vaccinology. The first immunomodulation vaccine is already on the market, while various others are close to it. Not in the least because one of the major stumbling blocks of immunomodulation through active vaccination, the inherent low immunogenicity of ‘self’ antigens, has in a number of other cases been solved. Most progress has been made in veterinary applications and has helped to formulate practical rules, necessary to break immunotolerance. It is not unlikely that these rules will be used to design better immunomodulation vaccines to be used in humans; notably to control fertility or combat tumours.",1
"Mice containing the activated v-Ha-ras oncogene driven by the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter/enhancer produced less tumor necrosis factor (TNF) than genetically identical animals without it. Inbred Oncomice containing the v-Ha-ras oncogene and inbred FVB mice without it were grown for 6 months. Splenocytes were isolated and stimulated in vitro to produce tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and γ-interferon (IFN). TNF production by cells from Oncomice was significantly decreased compared to cells from FBV mice. There was a tendency for decrease, but no significant difference was seen on IFN release. These observations suggest that the oncogene may play a role in the immune system.",1
"Faecal samples from 232 domestic pigs raised on concrete, 98 free-ranging village pigs, and five wild boar showed 46.6 ( 108 232 ), 54 ( 53 98 ) and 80% ( 4 5 ) prevalence of coccidian oocysts, respectively. Eight species of Eimeria, and Isospora suis, were recovered. In their descending order of predominance in the pigs raised on concrete, the species of coccidia were E. debliecki (26.7%), E. scabra (22.4%), E. neodebliecki (19.8%), E. porci (15.5%), E. suis (11.6%), E. polita (8.6%), E. perminuta (7%), E. spinosa (5.6%) and E. suis (3.9%). The first five species listed above predominated in the village pigs as well. E. polita, E. spinosa and I. suis were not found in the wild boar. I. suis oocysts prevailed in 8.3% of the 36 sows on concrete, and in 11.1% ( 3 27 ) of those which were positive for coccidia. Isosporoid oocysts were absent in the village sows. Of the 125 <24-day-old piglets, 29.6% were diarrhoeic, and of these, 43.2% were positive for coccidia. Four of the 16 (25%) coccidia-positive, diarrhoeic piglets, and four of the 37 (10.8%) coccidia-positive non-diarrhoeic piglets shed I. suis oocysts, an observation which seems to weaken the present contention that I. suis is the primary causative agent of neonatal porcine occidiosis. The highest mean number of oocysts per gram faeces (23 550) was recorded from the diarrhoeic farm piglets on conrete, and the lowest of 6,100 from the gestating farm sows. Mean opg data revealed very little significant quantitative variation between the corresponding age groups of the free-ranging village pigs and the commercially-farmed ones. One of the most interesting findings in the study was that the sows were more frequently infected than all other age groups.",1
"This paper describes an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis. A monoclonal antibody with a high affinity against an oocyst antigen was used to set up the test. The efficiency of this assay was compared with that of the flotation test; 275 calf faecal samples were examined by the two methods. There was 96% agreement between the two tests. For the 11 conflicting samples, the two tests were repeated and a modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining was performed on faecal smears. All these 11 samples contained few oocysts, but only five and six of them were shown to be positive by the ELISA and flotation tests, respectively. The degree of sensitivity of the ELISA and flotation tests is comparable; samples heavily or moderately contaminated with oocysts are detected by both methods. This ELISA is reliable and never gives rise to false positive results. Nevertheless, as with the flotation test, the occasional case containing very few oocysts will not always be detected by this test. If necessary, very accurate diagnosis can be made by a staining technique or by a direct immunofluorescent assay. In veterinary medicine, the ELISA seems to be a method of choice; it appears to be a fast and reliable technique which could be used as a routine test for the detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts. Nevertheless the degree of sensitivity must always be borne in mind. There is no need for a microscopic examination, which is an additional advantage.",1
"The chemoprophylactic effects of halofuginone lactate were tested against calf experimental cryptosporidiosis. Twenty 2-day-old calves, divided into four groups, were orally inoculated with 1 × 106 oocysts of Cryptosporidium parvum. The infected control group was unmedicated whereas the three other groups were medicated with the drug at 30, 60 and 120 μg kg−1 day−1, respectively, for 7 days, from Day (D) 2 to D8 post-inoculation (D 0 was inoculation day). The calves were weighed twice weekly and disease development and drug efficacy were assessed daily from D0 to D30 from consistency of feces, shedding of oocysts and mortality. Experimental C. parvum infection caused a severe clinical disease with profuse watery diarrhea, high oocyst shedding and mortality (3 out of 5) in the unmedicated group. The results clearly demonstrated the efficacy of halofuginone lactate in reducing the severity of clinical cryptosporidiosis. This efficacy was dose-dependent. The lowest dose (30 μg kg−1 day−1) was not able to prevent clinical disease and mortality (3 out of 5). No clinical signs were observed with the 60 and 120 μg kg−1 day−1 doses, but the animals shed oocysts after drug withdrawal. This shedding was more delayed the higher the dose of drug administered, but the delayed shedding had no effect on the growth of the animals.",1
"An outbreak of diarrhea in neonatal lambs occurred on a a sheep farm in northern Ohio. Diarrhea commenced as early as 1 week of age and lasted for about 3–4 days. Although 100% of the newborn lambs were affected, most had recovered by 3 weeks of age. Cryptosporidium infection appeared to be the cause of diarrhea. Fecal examination of nine diarrheic newborn lambs (5–10 days old), 23 older lambs (2–3 weeks old, six with diarrhea) and 23 clinically normal ewes by immunofluorescence assays revealed infection rates of 100%, 78.3% and 17.4%, respectively. Most newborn lambs had high oocyst counts. Ewes were considered to be an important source of infection for lambs.",1
"The immunosuppressive effect of experimental Boophilus microplus infestation on bovine peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and on host antibody production to a protein antigen (ovalbumin) was examined. Boophilus microplus infestation caused a marginal decrease in the percentage of T lymphocytes in PBL, which was observed in both lightly (5000 larvae) and heavily (40 000 larvae) infested cattle, and began at the second infestation and continued until the end of the fourth infestation. The percentage of B lymphocytes in heavily tick-infested cattle was less than that in non-infested control cattle after the fourth infestation. The response of PBL from tick-infested cattle to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) was always less than that of tick-free cattle after the second infestation. No noteworthy differences were detected between the three stages of tick infestation, that is, 1 week before the peak of adult engorgement, the middle of the peak and 1 week after all ticks had dropped. Boophilus microplus saliva (100 μl ml−1) suppressed 47% of the response of bovine PBL to PHA in vitro. This suppressive effect of saliva may contribute to the lowerresponsiveness of PBL from tick-infested cattle. Antibody production by tick-infested cattle was examined during the third and fourth heavy tick infestation. Tick-infested cattle showed a diminished response against ovalbumin after the second immunization. The immunosuppressive effects of tick infestation may play an important role in tick survival or in the transmission of tick-borne diseases in the field.",1
"Giardia and Cryptosporidium infections were diagnosed by immunofluorescence assay on two Ohio dairy farms with calf diarrhea problems. On the first farm, all nine diarrheic calves sampled once in June had Giardia cysts in their feces. On the second farm, all five diarrheic calves examined at the beginning of the diarrhea outbreak in March had Giardia infection. When resampled, the overall infection rate of normal and diarrheic calves was 82.4% in April, and 40.0% in August after the diarrhea subsided. Positive calves ranged from 11 to 164 days of age, and 22.2% of them were as young as 1 to 3 weeks of age. Eight of nine diarrheic calves (88.8%) on the first farm had Cryptosporidium infection. Lower infection rates (<30%) were found on the second farm. Six of 10 positive calves were 11–22 days old, three were 164–177 days old, and one was 71 days old. Five of these 10 positive calves were also positive for Giardia infection. Five diarrheic calves on the northern Ohio farm and one diarrheic calf on the central Ohio farm were treated with metronidazole after failing to respond to antibiotic therapy. Clinical improvement was observed in all calves within 48 h after the start of treatment. The high Giardia infection rates and intensities in calves of a wide age range and the clinical response to metronidazole suggest that Giardia infection contributed to the outbreaks of diarrhea.",1
"Monensin, a monovalent ion-selective ionophore, facilitates the transmembrane exchange of principally sodium ions for protons. The outer surface of the ionophore-ion comples is composed largely of nonpolar hydrocarbon, which imparts a high solubility to the complexes in nonpolar solvents. In biological systems, these complexes are freely soluble in the lipid components of membranes and, presumably, diffuse or shuttle through the membranes from one aqueous membrane interface to the other. The net effect for monensin is a trans-membrane exchange of sodium ions for protons. However, the interaction of an ionophore with biological membranes, and its ionophoric expression, is highly dependent on the biochemical configuration of the membrane itself. One apparent consequence of this exchange is the neutralization of acidic intracellular compartments such as the trans Golgi apparatus cisternae and associated elements, lysosomes, and certain endosomes. This is accompanied by a disruption of trans Golgi apparatus cisternae and of lysosome and acidic endosome function. At the same time, Golgi apparatus cisternae appear to swell, presumably due to osmotic uptake of water resulting from the inward movement of ions. Monensin effects on Golgi apparatus are observed in cells from a wide range of plant and animal species. The action of monensin is most often exerted on the trans half of the stacked cisternae, often near the point of exit of secretory vesicles at the trans face of the stacked cisternae, or, especially at low monensin concentrations or short exposure times, near the middle of the stacked cisternae. The effects of monensin are quite rapid in both animal and plant cells; i.e., changes in Golgi apparatus may be observed after only 2–5 min of exposure. It is implicit in these observations that the uptake of osmotically active cations is accompanied by a concomitant efflux of H+ and that a net influx of protons would be required to sustain the ionic exchange long enough to account for the swelling of cisternae observed in electron micrographs. In the Golgi apparatus, late processing events such as terminal glycosylation and proteolytic cleavages are most susceptible to inhibition by monensin. Yet, many incompletely processed molecules may still be secreted via yet poorly understood mechanisms that appear to bypass the Golgi apparatus. In endocytosis, monensin does not prevent internalization. However, intracellular degradation of internalized ligands may be prevented. It is becoming clear that endocytosis involves both acidic and non-acidic compartments and that monensin inhibits those processes that normally occur in acidic compartments. Thus, monensin, which is capable of collapsing Na+ and H+ gradients, has gained wide-spread acceptance as a tool for studying Golgi apparatus function and for localizing and identifying the molecular pathways of subcellular vesicular traffic involving acid compartments. Among its advantages are the low concentrations at which inhibitions are produced (0.01–1.0 μM), a minimum of troublesome side effects (e.g., little or no change of protein synthesis or ATP levels) and a reversible action. Because the affinity of monensin for Na+ is ten times that for K+, its nearest competitor, monensin mediates primarily a Na+-H+ exchange. Monensin has little tendency to bind calcium. Not only is monensin of importance as an experimental tool, it is of great commercial value as a coccidiostat for poultry and to promote more efficient utilization of feed in cattle. The mechanisms by which monensin interact with coccidia and rumen microflora to achieved these benefits are reasonably well documented. However, the interactions between monensin and the tissues of the host animal are not well understood although the severe toxicological manifestations of monensin poisoning are well known. Equine species are particularly susceptible to monensin poisoning, and a common effect of monensin poisoning is vacuolization and/or swelling of mitochondria in striated muscle. Other pathological injuries to striated muscle, spleen, lung, liver and kidney also have been noted. A consistent observation is cardiac myocyte degeneration as well as vacuolization. Differences in cellular response resulting from exposure to monensin (i.e., Golgi apparatus swelling in cultured cells, isolated tissues, and plants vs.mitochondrial swelling in animals fed monensin) suggest that myocardial damage is due either to a monensin metabolite or is a secondary response to some other derivation. However, as pointed out by Bergen and Bates [26], the underlying mode of action of ionophores is on transmembrane ion fluxes which dissipate cation and proton gradients. Consequently, some or all of the observed monensin effects in vivo in animals could be secondary phenomena caused by disruption of normal membrane physiology resulting from altered ion fluxes.",1
"Dysfunction of subcortical serotoninergic neurons has been implicated in some behaviour disturbances. The serotoninergic neurons in the dorsal and median raphe project widely in the brain. They innervate the olfactory bulbs and can be targets for exogenous agents attacking the olfactory epithelium and bulbs. We report here an injury to the serotoninergic neurons after intranasal infection in 12-day-old rats with a temperature-sensitive mutant of vesicular stomatitis virus. The brain infection was focal and transient. Viral antigens could no longer be detected 13–15 days after infection. In spite of this the animals, as adults, had a severe serotonin depletion in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and showed abnormal locomotor and explorative behaviour as well as learning deficits. The neocortex was histologically intact and parameters related to other neurotransmitters such as dopamine, noradrenaline, GABA and acetylcholine showed no marked changes. A relatively selective damage to serotoninergic nuclei as a result of virus neuroinvasion through a natural portal of entry, may constitute a new pathogenetic mechanism for cortical dysfunction and behavioural deficits.",1
"Excitotoxins are thought to kill neurons while sparing afferent fibers and axons of passage. The validity of this classical conclusion has recently been questioned by the demonstration of axonal demyelination. In addition, axons are submitted to a profound alteration of their glial environment. This work was, therefore, undertaken to reassess axonoglial interactions over time after an excitotoxic lesion in the rat. Ultrastructural studies were carried out in the ventrobasal thalamus two days to 18 months after neuronal depletion by in situ injections of kainic acid. In some cases, lemniscal afferents were identified by using anterograde transport of wheatgerm agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase from the dorsal column nuclei. Two and four days after kainate injection, numerous dying axons displaying typical signs of Wallerian degeneration were observed in a neuropile characterized by the loss of neuronal somata and dendrites, an increase in number of microglia/macrophages and the disappearance of astrocytes. Ten and 12 days after kainate injection, degenerating axons were no longer observed although myelin degeneration of otherwise unaltered axons was ongoing with an accumulation of myelin remnants in the neuropile. At 16 and 20 days, the demyelination process was apparently complete and axons of different diameters were sometimes packed together. One and two months after kainate injection, the axonal environment changed again: remyelination of large-caliber axons occurred at the same time as reactive astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and numerous Schwann cells appeared in the tissue. Schwann cell processes surrounded aggregates of axons of diverse calibers, ensheathed small ones and myelinated larger ones. Axons were also remyelinated by oligodendrocytes. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled lemniscal afferents could be myelinated by either of the two cell types. After three months, the neuropile exhibited an increase in number of hypertrophied astrocytes and the progressive loss of any other cellular or axonal element. At this stage, remaining Schwann cells were surrounded by a glia limitans formed by astrocytic processes. These data indicate that although excitotoxins are sparing the axons, they are having a profound and complex effect on the axonal environment. Demyelination occurs over the first weeks, accompanying the loss of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Axonal ensheathment and remyelination takes place in a second period, associated with the reappearance of oligodendrocytes and recruitment of numerous Schwann cells, while reactive astrocytes appear in the tissue at a slightly later time. Over the following months, astrocytes occupy a greater proportion of the neuron-depleted territory and other elements decrease in number. These successive stages in alteration of axonoglial interactions seem to evolve in parallel to the changes in density and terminal morphology that we described earlier for myelinated afferent fibers to the excitotoxic lesion.",1
"Several neurotropic viruses enter the brain after peripheral inoculation and spread transneuronally along pathways known to be connected to the initial site of entry. In this study, the pathways utilized by two such viruses, herpes simplex virus type 1 and mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM, were compared using in situ hybridization following inoculation into either the nasal cavity or the main olfactory bulb of the mouse. The results indicate that both viruses spread to infect a unique and only partially overlapping set of connections of the main olfactory bulb. Both quantitative and qualitative differences were observed in the patterns of infection of known primary and secondary main olfactory bulb connections. Using immunohistochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase combined with in situ hybridization, it was shown that only herpes simplex virus infected noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus. In contrast, both viruses infected dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area, although mouse hepatitis virus produced a more widespread infection in the A10 group, as well as infecting A8 and A9. The results suggest that differential virus uptake in specific neurotransmitter systems contributes to the pattern of viral spread, although other factors, such as differences in access to particular synapses on infected cells and differences in the distribution of the cellular receptor for the two viruses, are also likely to be important. The data show that neural tracing with different viruses may define unique neural pathways from a site of inoculation. The data also demonstrate that two viruses can enter the brain via the olfactory system and localize to different structures, suggesting that neurological diseases involving disparate regions of the brain could be caused by different viruses, even if entry occurred at a common site.",1
"The central nervous system responds to diverse neurologic injuries with a vigorous activation of astrocytes. While this phenomenon is found in many different species, its function is obscure. Understanding the molecular profile characteristic of reactive astrocytes should help define their function. The purpose of this review is to provide a summary of molecules whose levels of expression differentiate activated from resting astrocytes and to use the molecular profile of reactive astrocytes as the basis for speculations on the functions of these cells. At present, reactive astrocytosis is defined primarily as an increase in the number and size of cells expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein. In vivo, this increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells reflects predominantly phenotypic changes of resident astroglia rather than migration or proliferation of such cells. Upon activation, astrocytes upmodulate the expression of a large number of molecules. From this molecular profile it becomes apparent that reactive astrocytes may benefit the injured nervous system by participating in diverse biological processes. For example, upregulation of proteases and protease inhibitors could help remodel the extracellular matrix, regulate the concentration of different proteins in the neuropil and clear up debris from degenerating cells. Cytokines are key mediators of immunity and inflammation and could play a critical role in the regulation of the blood-central nervous system interface. Neurotrophic factors, transporter molecules and enzymes involved in the metabolism of excitotoxic amino acids or in the antioxidant pathway may help protect neurons and other brain cells by controlling neurotoxin levels and contributing to homeostasis within the central nervous system. Therefore, an impairment of astroglial performance has the potential to exacerbate neuronal dysfunction. Based on the synopsis of studies presented, a number of issues become apparent that deserve a more extensive analysis. Among them are the relative contribution of microglia and astrocytes to early wound repair, the characterization of astroglial subpopulations, the specificity of the astroglial response in different diseases as well as the analysis of reactive astrocytes with techniques that can resolve fast physiologic processes. Differences between reactive astrocytes in vivo and primary astrocytes in culture are discussed and underline the need for the development and exploitation of models that will allow the analysis of reactive astrocytes in the intact organism.",1
"There are presently two competitive theories that attempt to explain the etiology of multiple sclerosis (MS). Briefly summarized, they are: 1. An infection, probably of viral type, may attack the oligodendroglia of the central nervous system; or, 2. An autoimmune process may begin with an infection of the peripheral lymphatic immune system, producing antibodies that cross the blood-brain barrier, leading to myelinoclasia. Since 1935, research has been directed toward myelin of the central nervous system and the myelin sheaths of peripheral nerve; however, dorsal root and cranial sensory ganglia (DRG) have apparently not been studied. The present hypothesis states that an infectious agent (probably viral) finds privileged sanctuary in the dorsal root and cranial sensory ganglia (DRG): thereafter periodically invading the spinal cord, brain, or peripheral nerve. Previously reported erratic spinal fluid viral titers and cultures can be explained by differences in the anatomy of the DRG in which there is a variable and limited contact of spinal fluid with sensory ganglia. Clues to this hypothesis were noted by the author during routine neurological examinations of patients with MS, in which sensory signs and symptoms were frequently encountered. This clinical observation has also been reported by others who found such symptoms in 75% of MS patients, ranking second only to incoordination.",1
"Rats were injected with a fractionated 50 ml/kg dose of Fluosol®-DA 20% with and without exposure to 100% oxygen. Animals were killed at 24, 43, 92, and 183 days post-treatment and samples taken for hematological, hepatic enzyme, histological, and perfluorochemical analyses. There were no significant differences in hemograms or hepatic enzyme findings between treatment and control groups. Differences in organ weights and histology were a result of perfluorochemical (PFC) accumulation in the tissues of treated animals. All changes were reversible. There were no effects from breathing high oxygen levels in either treatment or control animals.",1
"Fifty Belgian white-blue male calves, purchased from the market at about 10 days of age, were divided into three groups. The basic diet was the same for all calves, and consisted of a restricted amount of commercial milk replacer containing 50 ppm zinc bacitracin and 20 pm virginiamycin, calf starter and grass hay. Weaning occurred when daily starter intake over 7 consecutive days averaged 0.5 kg. Maximum starter intake was restricted to 3 kg day−1, and grass hay was fed ad libitum. The experiment lasted 20 weeks. Group 1 (control) received the basic diet. Groups 2 and 3 were supplemented with either 2 g purified immunoglobulins (Ig) or 25-ml pooled colostrum (CO) twice daily, via the milk replacer as used in Group 1. Neither Ig nor CO exerted a positive effect on growth rate and feed efficiency. Six calves died: two, one and three in Groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Their serum IG content was significantly lower than that of the surviving animals. Mechanisms explaining the lack of any protective effect are discussed. It is supposed that the main reason was due to the gap between the CO feeding at birth and the onset of the administration of Ig or CO at the start of the experiment. At that time, 31 of the 50 calves excreted rota-and/or coronaviruses.",1
"The historical background of the present UK legislation is briefly reviewed, and the current legal situation as it pertains to the UK and European Community is summarised. The reasons for the inclusion of antibiotics in feed are outlined and discussed. In the first case, feedstuffs may have to be medicated for reasons of disease prevention and control. In large herds, especially in loose housing, mass medication by injection is not possible and even minimal disease herds will become infected with airborne pathogens from time to time. In the second case, continuous low-level feeding of antibiotics to growing pigs (growth promoters) suppresses the growth of harmful bacteria and allows healthier pigs to grow faster and more efficiently, thus producing cheaper food at the same time as improving welfare. The legal requirements regarding medicines available only on prescription are outlined and discussed. The fears and worries of the general public are noted and found to be overstated because of misconceptions and misunderstanding. It is concluded that food and milk produced today will remain safe provided the safety rules are adhered to.",1
"The genetic sensitivity of mouse strains to mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV 3) has been related in vitro to a delay of virus replication in liver sinusoidal cells. In vivo immuno-histochemical studies of the liver from infected mice have demonstrated that mechanisms other than direct viral injury are in operation. To examine potential mechanisms, the interaction of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated Kupffer cells with MHV 3 was studied. We first observed a dramatic inhibition in viral replication in LPS-treated Kupffer cells explanted from A/J resistant mice. Second, we demonstrated that MHV 3 induced a dose-dependent interleukin 1 (IL-1) activity in the supernatants of infected Kupffer cells of both strains. These results led us finally to examine the antigen-proceesing function of the Kupffer cellsof both strains of mice. No striking differences were observed in the ability of Kupffer cells from resistant or sensitive mice to collaborate with immunocompetent lymphocytes. Our data suggest that Kupffer cells play a double role which is crucial in the pathogenesis of MHV 3-induced hepatitis. First, they act directly as the genetically determined sensitivity of mice to MHV 3 infection is correlated with the efficiency of the antiviral activity induced in Kupffer cells by LPS. Second, they act indirectly through the synthesis of different amounts of IL-1 induced by MHV 3. This hypothesis is further borne out by the effects of indomethacin treatment on the course of MHV 3 infection in A/J resistant mice in vivo.",1
"We present the sequence of an open reading frame (ORF) at the 3′ end of human astrovirus serotype 1. Primer extension experiments showed that the RNA expressing this gene is shorter than the complete ORF, and could form a protein of M r 85 540. The protein was expressed by recombinant baculovirus and was recognized by anti-virion serum, indicating a structural role. Sequence comparison indicates that astrovirus serotypes 1 and 2 differ markedly in the C-terminal half of the protein but are well conserved towards the N-terminus.",1
"DNA sequencing of genomic cDNA clones of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) has been carried out. 770 bases have been determined which include genomic sequences spanning the 5' termini of the two smallest mRNAs of the 3'-coterminal “nested” set: mRNA A and mRNA B. This region contains the complete coding sequences for mRNA B which are additional to those present in mRNA A. Two open reading frames are present, predicting proteins of M rs 7500 and 9500.",1
"A prokaryotic vector, pGE374, containing the recA and lacZ genes, out-of-frame, was used for the expression of cDNA derived from the putative polymerase-encoding gene of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59). The pGE374/viral recombinant vector generates a tripartite bacterial/viral protein composed of a segment of the RecA protein at the N terminus, the coronaviral sequences in the middle, and an enzymatically active β-galactosidase at the C terminus. Rabbits immunized with such recombinant proteins generated antibodies to the MHV-A59 portion of the tripartite protein. Because the MHV-A59 polymerase proteins have been difficult to identify during infection, we used a novel method to demonstrate the viral specificity of the antiserum. The viral cDNA was excised from the expression vector, and transferred to a pGem vector, downstream from and in-frame with a portion of the cat gene. This construct contained a bacteriophage RNA polymerase promoter that enabled the cell-free synthesis of a fusion protein that was used to verify that antibodies were generated to the expressed viral DNA. This strategy was shown to successfully result in the specific generation of antibodies to the encoded information of the viral cDNA. Furthermore, this method has general applicability in the generation and characterization of antibodies directed against proteins encoded in cDNAs.",1
"A recombinant vaccinia virus producing the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase was used to express foreign genes in eukaryotic cells. Translation efficiency in this expression system was enhanced significantly by employing the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) 5'-untranslated region (UTR) which confers cap-independent translation by directing internal initiation of translation. The enhancement was accomplished by fusing open reading frames (ORFs) to the N terminus of the EMCV polyprotein coding region, thus utilizing its highly efficient translation initiation site. Expression vectors were constructed to allow cloning in all three reading frames. As reporter genes, we used the lacZ gene and a number of genes encoding coronavirus structural proteins: among others the genes encoding glycoproteins with N-terminal signal sequences. The signal sequences of these glycoproteins are located internally in the primary translation product. We demonstrated that this did not interfere with translocation and glycosylation and yields biologically active proteins. The usefulness of sequences that direct internal initiation was extended by using EMCV UTR s to express two and three ORFs from polycistronic mRNAs.",1
"Envelope glycoprotein E of flaviviruses is exposed at the surface of the virion, and is responsible for eliciting a neutralizing antibody (Ab) response, as well as protective immunity in the host. In this report, we describe a method for the fine mapping of a linear sequence of the E protein of dengue virus type-2 (DEN-2), recognized by a type-specific and neutralizing monoclonal Ab (mAb), 3H5. First, an Escherichia coli expression vector containing a heat-inducible λ p l promoter was used to synthesize several truncated, and near-full length E polypeptides. Reactivities of these polypeptides with polyclonal mouse hyperimmune sera, as well as the 3H5 mAb revealed the location of the 3H5-binding site to be within a region of 166 amino acids (aa) between aa 255 and 422. For fine mapping, a series of targeted deletions were made inframe within this region using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The hydrophilicity pattern of this region was used as a guide to systematically delete the regions encoding the various groups of surface aa residues within the context of a near-full-length E polypeptide by using PCR. The 3H5-binding site was thus precisely mapped to a region encoding 12 aa (between aa 386 and 397). A synthetic peptide containing this sequence was able to bind to the 3H5 mAb specifically, as shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, we show that rabbit Abs raised against the synthetic peptide of 12 aa were able to bind to the authentic E protein, and to neutralize DEN-2 virus in a plaque reduction assay.",1
"The biliary glycoprotein (BGP)-encoding gene is a member of the human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) gene family. We have now cloned several mouse Bgp cDNAs from an outbred CDR-1 mouse colon cDNA library, as well as by reverse transcription-PCR amplification of colon RNA. The distinguishing features of the deduced Bgp protein isoforms are found in the two divergent N-terminal domains, the highly conserved internal C2-set immunoglobulin domains, and an intracytoplasmic domain of either 10 or 73 amino acids (aa). The cDNA structures suggest that these mRNAs are produced through alternative splicing of a Bgp gene and the usage of multiple transcriptional terminators. The Bgp deduced aa sequences are highly homologous to several well characterized rat hepatocyte proteins such as the cell CAM105/ecto-ATPase/ppl20/HA4 proteins. Oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes representing the various cDNA isoform domains revealed predominant transcripts of 1.8, 3.1 and 4.0 kb on Northern analyses of mouse colon RNA; some of these bands are actually composed of several co-migrating transcripts. The transcripts encoding the long intracytoplasmic-tailed Bgp proteins are expressed at one-tenth the relative abundance of the shorter-tailed species. We have previously demonstrated that several mouse Bgp cDNAs, when transfected into eukaryotic cells, express BGP proteins at the cell surface and function in vitro as cell adhesion molecules, much like their human and rat counterparts. The expression of the many Bgp isoforms at the surface of epithelial cells, such as colon, suggests that these proteins play a determinant role, through self- or heterologous contact, in renewal and/or differentiation of their epithelia.",1
"A 50-nucleotide (nt) untranslated region (coding gap sequence) that interrupts the amino acid coding sequence in T4 gene 60, plus an additional 5 nt upstream and another 3 nt downstream from the gap sequence, shows unusual folding patterns according to RNA structure prediction. A predicted highly stable and significant hairpin structure in the 5' half of the gap sequence and a plausible tertiary structural element computed in the 3' part of the gap sequence seem significant by statistical tests on the wild-type (wt) sequence. This feature is absent in insertion, deletion and substitution variants of the gap sequence, in which template activities are markedly lower than that of the wt. The proposed feature is consistent with currently available data showing that the translational bypass of the coding gap is correlated with a stop codon involved in a stem-loop structure folded in the gap sequence. We suggest that the role of this segment in “ribosomal bypass” of a portion of the mRNA sequence is a property of its special folded structure.",1
"The clpG gene, expressing the Escherichia coli major CS31A fimbrial subunit ClpG, was subjected to random mutagenesis by insertion of an EcoRI linker and a kanamycin-resistance (KmR) cassette into the multiple newly generated EcoRI sites. The KmR gene was then excised by PstI, which left a 48-bp linker representing the heterologous sequence. The same procedure was followed to introduce a synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotide (oligo) corresponding to epitope C from the spike protein S from the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV). Nine insertion/deletion mutants (indels) that contained long foreign peptides variously located around the ClpG signal peptide (SP) processing site were characterized. A striking feature of this study is the variety of amino acid (aa) insertions in the ClpG prepilin that have little or no effect on CS31A fimbria biogenesis. These ‘permissive’ sites tolerate inserts of 18 or 19 aa and accept sequences of different natures in view of their aa composition, charge and hydrophobicity. The results obtained here are also interesting in light of the high level of aa sequence conservation seen in the SP and N-terminal domains of the ClpG-related subunits. The structure-function relationship of the ClpG SP is discussed. The TGEV-C epitope fused to the N-terminal end of the mature ClpG protein was cell-surface exposed, as observed on immuno-electron microscopy. Therefore, the CS31A fimbria seems to be a potent tool for the presentation of foreign antigenic determinants or the production of heterologous polypeptides in E. coli.",1
"A strain of bovine coronavirus (BC) adapted to tissue culture, was inoculated into organ cultures of bovine foetal trachea. Haemagglutinin in the fluid from infected organ cultures reached titres of 32 and characteristic coronavirus particles were observed electron microscopically. BC virus antigen was detected in frozen sections of the organ cultures by staining with fluorescent antibody. These data were evidence that BC virus replicated in organ cultures of respiratory tissue. The use of this technique for primary isolation of bovine coronaviruses from field material is discussed.",1
"Replication of calf diarrhea coronavirus was not inhibited by 5-iodo-2′-deoxyuridine, indicating that the virus is an RNA virus. Sensitivity to ether and chloroform indicated that the virus is enveloped, and this was confirmed by electron microscopic observation of the virion. The virus was readily inactivated by trypsin and sodium deoxycholate. The virus was labile at 50°C in diluted medium, but readily stabilized in the presence of MgCl2. It was stable at pH 5 and 7, while a slight loss of infectivity was observed at pH 3. The virus was readily filtered through membrane filters of 200 and 100-nm pore sizes, but not through 50-nm filters. The buoyant density of the virion in CsCl was estimated to be 1.25 g/ml.",1
"The virus was grown in BEK-1 cells, a stable cell line from bovine embryo kidney, and tested for hemagglutination (HA) with erythrocytes of a variety of species at 4°C, room temperature and 37°C. HA was observed at all temperatures with chicken, mouse, rat, and hamster erythrocytes but not with erthyrocytes of human (O), cattle, horses, sheep, guinea pigs, geese, ducks, pigeons and 1-day-old chicks. Chickens showed an individual variation in agglutinability of their erythrocytes, requiring selection of birds to obtain erythrocytes for HA. HA reaction was inhibited by specific antiserum. Some factors involved in HA and HA inhibition (HI) were investigated and standard HA and HI tests were worked out.",1
"Coronaviruses were isolated from neonatal calves with diarrhoea in Great Britain and Denmark. They were serially passed in gnotobiotic calves which developed acute diarrhoea. Pathological lesions were found in the small and large intestines. Coronaviruses were demonstrated by electron microscopic examination of the faeces and intestinal contents, immunofluorescent staining of sections of small and large intestine and by isolation in tracheal organ cultures. In early passages of the British coronavirus, particles of about 30 nm in diameter were observed in the faeces by electron microscopy. These particles were removed from the coronavirus preparations by cross-protection experiments in calves. The coronaviruses were morphologically and antigenically similar to the bovine coronavirus isolated in the United States and the British virus was adapted to replicate in calf kidney cell cultures.",1
"Cross-protection studies between the feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) viruses were conducted in cats, pigs and pregnant gilts. Cats vaccinated with TGE virus developed neutralizing antibodies against TGE virus and low titer antibody against FIP virus detected by an indirect fluorescent antibody technique but were not protected against a virulent FIP virus challenge. Baby pigs and pregnant gilts vaccinated with FIP virus did not develop detectable antibodies to TGE virus. Nevertheless, it appeared that vaccination of swine with FIP virus conferred some immunity against TGE virus infection. Seventeen-day-old pigs vaccinated with two doses of FIP virus had a 67% survival rate following a virulent TGE virus challenge, and 75% of the 3-day-old pigs suckling either FIP or TGE-virus-vaccinated gilts survived virulent TGE virus infection in contrast to 0% survival of baby pigs suckling unvaccinated gilts.",1
"Pregnant sows were inoculated with inactivated transmissible gastroenteritis virus and with preparations of virus surface projections and subviral particles derived by detergent treatment of the virus. Neutralising antibody was demonstrated in serum and colostrum from animals that received whole virus or preparations of surface projections whereas subviral particles failed to stimulate neutralising antibody formation. Similar results were obtained with serum from rabbits inoculated with whole virus and structural components. All three preparations stimulated the formation of agglutinating antibodies, as demonstrated by sedimentation analysis and filtration studies with radiolabelled virus. The immunoglobulin classes responsible for neutralising antibody activity in sows inoculated by the intramammary route were examined. In each case where the immunoglobulin class was determined, IgG was found. One sow that received surface projections also had IgA with neutralising activity in her colostrum. In contrast, infection of sows with live whole virus resulted in neutralising antibody of the IgG, IgM and IgA classes.",1
"A simple and rapid procedure has been developed for the detection of bovine coronaviruses in faecal specimens. The method consists of adsorption of the virus onto mouse erythrocytes at 4°C, removal of unadsorbed material and elution of adsorbed viral material at 37°C. The eluate is then used in a haemagglutination test. Specificity of the reaction is checked by a blocking assay. No non-specific reactions have been observed. The sensitivity of the test appeared to be better than that of the electron microscope, at least when crude faecal extracts are used. By ultracentrifugation of the eluates the sensitivity of the assay can be further improved.",1
"Two- to three-months-old pigs infected with transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus showed no clinical response when housed at 30°C, but comparable infected pigs exposed to temperature changes from 30°C to 4°C following infection showed typical signs of TGE. Development of TGE-specific immune responses, as measured by blastogenic response of tissue lymphocytes, occurred at 3 days post-inoculation (DPI) in pigs held at 30°C, but not until 7 DPI in infected pigs held under the adverse conditions. Immunosuppression with corticosteroids resulted in a fall in circulatory T cells, lowering of non-specific blastogenic response of circulatory lymphocytes, and clinical signs of disease when immunosuppressed pigs were infected with TGE virus and held at 30°C. It is suggested that clinical responses to TGE virus infection may be affected by the influence of ambient temperatures on the immune responses of pigs.",1
"An epizootic of acute diarrhoea of adult cattle occured in Japan during the winter of 1976 to 1977. A majority of adult cattle clinically diagnosed as having the disease, showed a significant rises in antibody titres to bovine coronavirus, whereas only a smal; minority showed serological evidence of recent infection with calf rotavirus, bovine adenovirus type 7, parainfluenza virus type 3, or bovine viral diarrhoea-mucosal disease virus. A coronavirus-like agent was detected by electron-microscopy in faecal material from a cow with diarrhoea, and was subsequently isolated in primary bovine kidney cell cultures.",1
"A coronavirus (Kakegawa isolate) isolated from a cow with epizootic diarrhea was grown in BEK-1 cells and examined for biophysical and biochemical properties. The Kakegawa isolate was able to replicate in the presence or absence of 5-iodo-2′-deoxy-uridine, indicating that its viral nucleic acid was RNA. It was highly sensitive to ether and chloroform, and moderately sensitive to trypsin and heat. It was, however, readily stabilized by treatment with cation at 50°C for 1 h. Its infectivity was slightly reduced at pH 3.0. The virus passed through a membrane filter of 200 nm pore size, but not through one of 100 nm pore size. The buoyant density of the virus was determined in a sucrose density gradient. The peak of infectivity and hemagglutinin activity was found at a density of 1.182. Neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition tests showed a close serological relationship between the Kakegawa isolate and the American strain of calf diarrhea coronavirus.",1
"Monospecific antisera were prepared in rabbits against canine coronavirus (CCV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus of pigs (TGEV), and in 24 pigs and 3 cats against TGEV alone. Neutralizing antibody titres were higher for the immunizing than the heterologous virus, although cross-neutralization usually was detected. This confirmed that CCV and TGEV are distinct, but antigenically related coronaviruses. In sera from 41 dogs, CCV-neutralizing titres were on average 2.7 fold higher than TGEV-neutralizing titres, suggesting that CCV was the causal agent. Sera from 29 cats in colonies with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and known to contain TGEV-neutralizing antibody, were found to have titres 12.3 fold higher against CCV. The FIP virus (FIPV) is probably more closely related to CCV than TGEV as judged by antigens involved in virus neutralization. Antisera to two isolates of bovine coronavirus, three isolates of haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, seven strains of avian infectious bronchitis virus and the 229E strain of human coronavirus all failed to neutralize CCV and TGEV. Thus CCV, TGEV and probably FIPV fall into a group of antigenically related agents, separable from other members of the family Coronaviridae, by both virus neutralization and immunofluorescence tests.",1
"Eleven, 11 and 2 of 11 precolostral sera from normal calves and 13, 14 and 9 of 14 sera from normal fetuses, 7 to 10 months of gestation, neutralized bovine parvovirus, coronavirus and rotavirus, respectively. When assayed by single radial immunodiffusion, all the sera contained IgG at 360 to 1400 mg/dl, and some of them had much smaller amounts of IgM or IgA. Most of the neutralizing activities against bovine coronavirus and rotavirus were readily inactivated by treatment with acetone or 2-mercaptoethanol. Some sera fractionated by Sephadex G-200 gel filtration or starch block electrophoresis had neutralizing activities against bovine parvovirus or coronavirus in fractions containing no detectable amounts of immunoglobulins. These observations seem to indicate the presence of substance(s), other than immunoglobulins, capable of inhibiting replication of bovine parvovirus, coronavirus or rotavirus. The chemical nature and the mode of action of the inhibitors await elucidation.",1
"Sixteen 2–3-days-old caesarean-derived, colostrum-deprived piglets were each dosed oro-nasally with 2 ml of a bacteria-free filtrate containing 104 pig-infectious-doses of CV 777. The piglets were killed at intervals of 12 to 120 h after infection. The coronvirus-like agent caused a local infection of the intestinal tract which resulted in villous atrophy, malabsorption and diarrhea. The pathogenesis of this infection was similar to that of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), a known coronaviral infection of pigs. However, where were some differences. By immunofluorescent staining, CV 777 antigens were not only detected in the epithelial cells covering the small intestinal villi, but also in the cells of the colonic surface epithelium. Occasional fluorescence was also seen in the small intestinal crypt epithelium, but the regenerative capacity of the crypts was not affected. The progress of intestinal epithelial cell infection by CV 777 was much slower than that in TGE, resulting in a longer incubation period and in less drastic epithelial cell destruction. The infection of regenerating cells occurred to a much higher degree during the late stage of a CV 777 infection than has been observed in TGE.",1
"Three precipitin reactions associated with bovine rotavirus infection were demonstrable by immunodiffusion. One of the reactions has been utilized in a diagnostic test for the detection of rotavirus in faeces, or specific antibody to rotavirus group antigen in serum or faeces. The test, based on bovine materials, appeared to be group-specific and effective in demonstrating rotaviral antigen or antibody in other species of animals, including human beings. The procedure was as efficient as electron microscopy in detecting evidence of rotavirus in faeces of calves and a range of other species.",1
"A study was made of the effects of rotavirus and/or enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) on dairy calves born and suckled on the farm and subsequently reared in isolation. Calves were orally inoculated at 6 days old with either rotavirus (5), ETEC (7), rotavirus and ETEC (5) or remained uninoculated controls (4), and their reactions were recorded by clinical, microbiological, and pathological observations. Rotavirus infection consistently produced diarrhoea, while ETEC inoculated alone did not colonise the intestine. In dual infections, both rotavirus and ETEC multiplied, although the severity of diarrhoea was not greater than that caused by rotavirus alone. Some ETEC-inoculated calves developed subsequent naturally-acquired rotavirus infections, but in these no ETEC multiplication occurred. The results suggest that prior or simultaneous rotavirus infection is necessary to enable ETEC colonisation of the intestine in convenstional calves of this age.",1
An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for the detection of the coronavirus-like agent in feces of pigs naturally affected with porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) or experimentally infected with the CV777 isolate. The assay was specific and more sensitive than electron microscopy. An ELISA blocking assay is described for the detection and titration of antibodies. Specific antibody formation was demonstrated in pigs experimentally infected with CV777 and in swine naturally affected with PED.,1
"A transmissible agent (Breda agent) was isolated from a calf with diarrhea and shown to be infectious by inoculation orally into gnotobiotic and conventionally reared calves. The “Breda” agent had the morphology of a virus and possessed a hemagglutinin. Antigenic studies showed the virus to be antigenically different from bovine coronavirus, parainfluenza 3 virus, bovine rotavirus, bovine parvovirus and bovine pestivirus (BVD). Attempts to culture the virus in cell or organ cultures or in embryonated eggs, were unsuccessful. The virus was either spherical or kidney shaped, with 7–9 nm peplomers on the surface. A few particles possessed coronavirus processes of 17–20 nm, but these were arranged irregularly and were thought to be tissue debris. Three out of eight experimental calves developed severe diarrhea and the lesions in the small and large intestines were similar to those reported for coronavirus. The virus replicated in the jejunal and ileal regions of the small intestine and in the spiral colon, as judged by immunofluorescence. The virus multiplied in all experimental calves and was excreted in the feces; excretion correlating with the onset of diarrhea or a change in the appearance of the feces. There was little or no malabsorption measured by the uptake of D-xylose and the fact that infection of both the crypt and villus epithelial cells was observed, suggests that the pathogenesis may be different from rotavirus and coronavirus. Fourteen of fortyseven calves in the outbreak were infected with the virus, virus was not identified in other farm outbreaks of the disease.",1
"Development is reported of a feline cell line which can support the growth of coronaviruses from canine (CCV), feline (FIPV) and porcine (TGEV) species. The cell culture has been serially transferred over 100 times and has retained its initial growth requirements, proliferative capacity and morphologic features. Each virus had specific growth characteristics in this cell culture although all produced a similar CPE and plaques under agar. Cross neutralization studies demonstrated a two-way relationship between TGEV and CCV and between TGEV and FIPV, whereas a one-way relationship was demonstrated between CCV and FIPV.",1
"ESK cells were shown to be a good medium for propagating the 67N strain of porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, although no cytopathic effect was observed. The virus induced a readily recognizable cytopathic effect in ESK cells, when a non-cytotoxic amount of diethylaminoethyl-dextran (DEAE-dextran) was incorporated in the culture medium. Based on this finding, a sensitive, practical assay method for the virus was developed. When DEAE-dextran was incorporated in the agar overlay medium, 67N virus formed plaques in ESK cell monolayers. The cytopathic effect as well as the plaque formation were specifically inhibited by antisera against the virus. Neutralization tests were developed on the basis of these findings. Neutralization and haemagglutination-inhibition tests on swine serum samples indicated a wide dissemation of haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus or antigenically-related viruses in Japanese pigs.",1
"Newborn calves inoculated with rotavirus, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) serotype 020:K′ × 106′:K99:HNM, either alone or in combination, became depressed, anorectic, diarrhoeic and dehydrated. ETEC did not adhere to the intestine although there was extensive proliferation in the lumen. Only slight mucosal changes were induced by ETEC and the activity of membrane bound lactase remained normal. More severe mucosal damage and a decrease in lactase activity were found in newborn calves inoculated with either rotavirus or rotavirus and ETEC in combination. The most severe clinical illness was found in calves inoculated with both rotavirus and ETEC. Calves inoculated at 1 week of age with either rotavirus or ETEC remained clinically normal. Rotavirus infection produced slight mucosal changes and a reduction of lactase activity. In contrast, colostrum-fed or suckling calves up to 2 weeks old inoculated with both rotavirus and ETEC became clinically affected, showed severe mucosal damage and decreased lactase activity. There was no bacterial adhesion to the intestinal mucosa as observed by immunofluorescent labelling and light microscopy.",1
"After inoculation into 2 foals, Berne virus induced neutralizing antibody, but did not cause clinical symptoms. In a horizontal study of seropositive mares and their offspring, a decline of maternal antibodies and a sudden synchronous seroconversion in all foals were observed, again without clinical symptoms. The virus is widespread in the Swiss horse population and has been so during the last decade; rises in antibody titers were noted in 9% of paired sera sampled at random. Positive reactions were also obtained in serum neutralization tests and ELISA using small numbers of horse sera from Germany, France and the U.S.A. The results of neutralization tests and ELISA were correlated in 83% of random samples tested; 13% were neutralization-positive and ELISA-negative and in 4% the inverse was observed. Neutralizing activity was found in the sera of other ungulates (cattle, goat, sheep and pig), laboratory rabbits and 2 species of wild mice (Clethrionomys glareolus and Apodemus sylvaticus). Inconclusive results were obtained with feline and human sera; those from dogs and foxes (Vulpes vulpes) were consistently negative. The probable occurrence of antigenic variants in Berne-type viruses is discussed.",1
"Two viruses, morphologically resembling coronaviruses and antigenically indistinguishable from bovine enteric coronavirus, were isolated in bovine tracheal organ cultures from the lungs and trachea of young calves with respiratory disease. Intranasal and intratracheal inoculation of these viruses into neonatal calves resulted in a predominantly upper respiratory tract infection, which was associated with the development of mild respiratory symptoms.",1
"Thermal inactivation of Berne virus proceeded at a linear rate between 31°C and 43°C. Storage at temperatures lower than −20°C preserved the infectivity, while at 4°C appreciable loss occurred between 92 and 185 days. Freeze-drying or desiccation at 22°C caused only insignificant loss of infectivity. Virus preparations were not affected by pH values between 2.5 and 10.3. Inactivation by UV occurred more rapidly than with herpes, toga and rhabdoviruses. Berne virus infectivity was sensitive to pronase and B. subtilis proteinase. It was not inactivated by trypsin and chymotrypsin treatment, which resulted in enhancement of infectivity; low concentrations of pronase (< 10 μg ml−1) had a similar effect on Berne virus. Neither phospholipase C or RNase, alone or in combination, nor sodium deoxycholate (0.1%) inactivated the virus; in contrast, Triton X-100 (0.1%, 1.0%) caused rapid inactivation with a constant level of residual infectivity.",1
"Specific release of 51Cr and the production of interferon (IFN) increased in parallel in a spontaneous cell-mediated cytotoxicity (SCMC) assay in which uninfected PK-15 cells or PK-15 cells persistently infected with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (PK-15-TGE cells) were used as targets, and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from a young adult pig were used as effector cells. Higher levels of both specific 51Cr release and IFN were obtained in the assays containing PK-15-TGE cells. Co-cultivation of PBL from newborn piglets with PK-15-TGE cells yielded similar levels of IFN to those produced by co-cultivation of adult PBL and PK-15-TGE cells, but lower levels of IFN were produced by co-cultivation with uninfected PK-15 cells. Pretreatment of adult PBL with IFN augmented their SCMC effector activity for both PK-15 and PK-15-TGE cells in the 51Cr release assay. Pretreatment of the PK-15-TGE target cells with IFN did not affect their release of 51Cr in the SCMC reaction, while IFN pretreatment of PK-15 targets protected them against SCMC. In a single cell cytotoxicity assay the effects of IFN pretreatment on the effector adult PBL and on the PK-15 and PK-15-TGE target cells were confirmed, and SCMC incompetent PBL from neonatal piglets were rendered cytotoxic by pretreatment with IFN. PBL from newborn piglets bound to either target cell with the same frequency as PBL from SCMC competent adult pigs, and IFN pretreatment of either effector or target cells had no effect on target-binding frequency.",1
"Commercial rabbits showing clinical signs of enteritis-complex were examined for the presence of Clostridium spiroforme and its iota-like toxin. The bacterium was detected by Gram stain in 52.4% of 149 cecal samples and iota-like toxin in 7.4%. From 29 strains of C. spiroforme tested, 26 were toxigenic, originating from 24 of 29 rabbitries. In 13.4% of the samples, C. spiroforme was present as the only known disease agent. Gross and microscopic lesions were similar to those described in the literature. In the other samples, C. spiroforme was associated with attaching effacing Escherichia coli (29.5%), Bacillus piliformis (10.3%), rotaviruses (25.6%), coronavirus (2.6%), Eimeria spp. (44.9%) and cryptosporidia (6.4%). In 33.3% of C. spiroforme-containing samples, more than one of these agents was present. There was no significant difference between the presence of these organisms in C. spiroforme-positive and negative samples. On the basis of these results as well as that of previous data, we suggest that C. spiroforme-mediated diarrhea is favoured by maldigestion, initiated by infectious agents and/or nutritional factors.",1
"Dysentery lasting 4–8 days was produced in five 4-day-old colostrum-fed calves, after inoculation with an atypical strain of Escherichia coli S102-9; peak excretion of S102-9 occurred during the period of dysentery. Two calves were killed when clinical signs were most severe and bacteria were seen attached to the surfaces of enterocytes in the large intestine; microscopic lesions were seen in these areas. The lesions were identical to those previously reported in a natural outbreak of dysentery in calves, from which E. coli S102-9 was isolated, and to those seen in gnotobiotic calves experimentally infected with S102-9. Reinfection of the three surviving calves 16–20 days later with S102-9 and primary infection of two calves aged 24 and 51 days did not cause dysentery. Four of 659 coliforms isolated from field outbreaks of calf diarrhoea resembled the atypical strain S102-9. These four isolates and S102-9 did not produce heat-stable enterotoxin, but all produced a toxin cytopathic for Vero and HeLa cells. Two of the four isolates were inoculated alone into 4-day-old gnotobiotic calves deprived of colostrum; neither calf developed dysentery but microscopic lesions identical to those produced by S102-9 were detected in the large intestines of both animals.",1
"Mouse myeloma cells (SP2/O) were fused with spleen cells from BALB/c mice immunized with detergent-solubilized antigen of purified virus, and 21 monoclonal (MC) antibodies reactive in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with the TO-163 strain of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus were obtained. Of these MC antibodies, 14, 6 and 1 were IgG1, IgG2a and IgM, respectively. All of the MC antibodies contained light chains of the kappa type. Of these MC antibodies, 8 were found to have neutralization (NT) activity against the TO-163 strain. Comparison of 7 strains of TGE virus by NT tests using our panel of MC antibodies confirmed their close antigenic relationships, but also revealed the occurence of distinct antigenic differences. These results suggest that there may be at least 6 different epitopes involved in NT reaction on the virion of the TO-163 strain. This notion was confirmed by the competitive binding assay.",1
"Diarrheic feces from 21 calves were examined by electron microscopy and 16 contained particles morphologically similar to those of Breda virus. The particles were spherical or elongated, 60–270 nm in greatest dimension and had surface spikes 9–13 nm long. Convalescent serum from a human patient with Breda virus-associated diarrhea reacted with one of the bovine viruses by immune electron microscopy, suggesting a serological resemblance between human and bovine Breda-like viruses. Immune electron-microscopy and immunofluorescence demonstrated that isolates of bovine Breda virus from the U.S.A. were related to the French virus. One of the viruses had a density in sucrose solution of 1.16, similar to the value for Berne virus.",1
"Four transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) strains (Purdue-115, D-52, 188-SG and Gep-II) and two cell lines (swine testis-ST and pig kidney-RPD) were used to study virus attachment and cell susceptibility. Virus attachment was partially thermodependent and the rate varied, depending on the strain. Identical TGEV inocula produced a higher plaque number by plaque assay in the swine testis cell line (ST) than in the pig kidney cell line (RPD) but [3H]uridine-labèlled virus was found associated equally well with both cell lines. A field TGEV strain (Gep-II), which was unable to multiply in cell cultures, appeared able to inhibit the attachment of radiolabelled cell-passaged virus. Therefore, the susceptibility to TGEV infection was apparently not determined at the virus-to-cell attachment stage. The attachment sites on the cell surface were specific, however, differences in TGEV attachment determinant between strains were not observed. Attachment of all the virus strains tested was enhanced by DEAE-dextran and inhibited by dextran sulfate, poly-L-lysine (PLL), poly-L-α-ornithine (PLO) and protamine sulfate.",1
"Inoculation of tracheal organ cultures from bovine foetuses with Mycoplasma bovis resulted in a loss of cellular structure of the lamina propria, followed 20–22 days later by lifting and detachment of overlying epithelium. The effect was associated with large numbers of M. bovis, identified by immunoperoxidase labelling and electromicroscopy, infiltrating between the epithelial cells and amassing in the lamina propria, especially in the region of the basement membrane of the epithelium. Ciliary activity was undiminished for up to 18 days following inoculation and little or no cytopathic effect on the ciliated epithelium was seen in spite of the close proximity of large numbers of organisms. In contrast, M. dispar was restricted to the margin of the ciliated epithelium where, as previously reported, it caused pyknosis, sloughing and flattening of the epithelium with consequent loss of ciliary activity. The cytopathology observed for each mycoplasma bore a close similarity to the behaviour of the two mycoplasmas in vivo and it is suggested that the organ culture system may be a useful and relevant system to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms for each mycoplasma.",1
"Three techniques for the detection of rotavirus in faecal samples from calves with neonatal gastroenteritis were compared. A preliminary study indicated that reverse passive haemagglutination (RPHA) was at least as sensitive as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). These two immunoassays were compared with the detection of viral RNA by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) on 209 field samples. Of the 77 samples in which at least one test gave a positive result, 69 were positive by both RPHA and PAGE, but only 49 were also positive by ELISA, indicating a lower sensitivity for the latter test. The overall agreement between RPHA and PAGE was 96%. The reasons for the discrepancies between the tests are discussed.",1
"Rotaviruses isolated from 43 sub-clinically infected calves from a single farm were analysed by genome profile analysis. The isolates showed genomic variation and eight different profiles were observed, including one which was atypical for Group A rotaviruses. The 3′ terminal labelling method for the analysis of genome profiles used in this study required only 1 ng of viral RNA, an increase of 1000-fold in sensitivity over ethidium bromide staining for detecting all rotavirus genome segments. However, dual infections involving two rotaviruses with distinct profiles could not be detected if the concentrations of the viruses differed by > 10-fold.",1
"The prevalence of porcine rotavirus infection was studied in 15 different herds located in the north-western region of Venezuela. The presence of rotavirus was studied by direct electron microscopy (EM) and by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). From 136 samples analyzed during the six months of the study (September 1983–February 1984), 38 (27.9%) were found to be positive for rotaviruses, with infection more common in animals that were 4–6 weeks old. Atypical rotaviruses were not detected in any of the samples examined. Most rotavirus positive specimens were subgrouped using specific monoclonal antibodies in an ELISA test. The majority of the samples (26 out of 38) were found to exhibit Subgroup I antigenicity. Only two specimens, collected from the same herd in two consecutive months, were found to belong to Subgroup II. To characterize further the circulating rotaviruses, electrophoretic analysis of the RNA genome was performed on samples selected from nine different herds. Great variability in the RNA electropherotypes was observed. No correlation was found between subgroup specificity and the migration of the two smaller segments (Genes 10 and 11), as has been described for human rotaviruses.",1
An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a detergent-solubilized antigen of purified virus was developed for detection of antibody against porcine transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus in swine serum. The ELISA demonstrated antibody responses in pigs immunized intramuscularly with the attenuated TO-163 strain of TGE virus and in pigs orally infected with the virulent Shizuoka strain of the virus. The results of the ELISA were well correlated with those of the neutralization test. These results indicate the usefulness of the ELISA as a serological tool for TGE virus antibody.,1
"Three- to four-week-old, just-weaned piglets were infected with transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus and the next day with K88ac+ enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). Histological examination of caudal jejunum and ileum of piglets killed 2–3 days after virus challenge (1–2 days after ETEC infection) revealed severe villus atrophy especially in the jejunum compared with controls (P<0.05). Four-5 days after TGE virus infection villus length increased and after 7 days it was near normal. Villi scraped from jejunal and ileal mucosa of the piglets were incubated in vitro with K88ac+ E. coli and the number of bacteria adhering to 250 μm villus brush border was counted. Attachment of bacteria to villi of piglets killed 2–3 days after TGE virus infection was significantly decreased in comparison with adhesion to villi of non-infected piglets or of piglets killed 7 days after the virus infection. Correlation between in vitro adhesion and villus height was 0.6649 (P<0.001). The results suggest that the experimentally-induced villus atrophy was attended with a temporarily diminished susceptibility of villus enterocytes to adhesion of K88ac+ E. coli.",1
"Eight specific pathogen-free cats were inoculated orally or parenterelly with a cell culture-adapted strain of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). Faeces and oropharyngeal swabs were monitored daily for infectious virus by inoculation of feline embryo long cells. Virus was recovered from both sites for ∼ 2 weeks after inoculation, before clinical signs of disease developed. Peripheral blood lymphocytes collected from these cats were tested in an in-vitro blastogenic assay using concanavalin A (con A) and FIPV antigen. All cats showed a profound suppression of the response to con A which only recovered to pre-inoculation levels in 2 cats, one of which survived. These 2 cats also responded to FIPV antigen on the 21st day after infection, the greater response being in the survivor. The other cats, surviving 16–18 days, developed no response to FIPV antigen. Antibody titres, measured by immunofluorescence and by virus neutralization, rose rapidly to very high levels in all cats, regardless of the route of inoculation.",1
"Monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) specific for the E1 and E2 surface glycoproteins of the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of swine were examined either alone or in combination to evaluate their potential value in protecting neonatal pigs against a lethal dose of TGEV. Cesarean-delivered colostrum-deprived (CDCD) piglets were given one pre-challenge dose of Mab and an equal dose of the same Mab at each successive feeding after challenge. In vivo challenge results demonstrated that neither Mabs given individually nor combinations of the Mabs were able to protect neonatal pigs against a lethal dose of TGEV. However, in parallel experiments, polyclonal antibodies from immune colostrum or serum were protective.",1
"The sites of early replication of feline infectious peritonitis virus were tudied following oral inoculation of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) cats with virus grown in cell cultures. Viral antigen was first detected by immunofluorescence in the tonsils and small intestine within 24 h of inoculation, and was later found in caecum, colon, mesenteric lymph nodes and liver. However, histological changes in the gut did not appear until relatively late in the course of infection. Virus was recovered from the oropharynx and the faeces from as early as the second or third day after inoculation, and shedding continued until euthanasia.",1
"A competitive inhibition ELISA was developed to detect non-neutralizing antibodies to the peplomer protein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) in porcine sera using a monoclonal antibody as an indicator. It was demonstrated that field strains of the TGEV-related porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) did not induce this antibody, whereas the Miller strain and field strains of TGEV did. The sensitivity of the competitive inhibition ELISA appeared to be similar to that of the virus neutralization (VN) test. The test enables differentiation of pigs which were previously infected with TGEV or PRCV and which cannot be distinguished by the classical anti-TGEV neutralization test. The present test is useful for selective serodiagnosis.",1
"The Minnesota strain of turkey enteric coronavirus (TCV) was propagated in HRT-18 cells, a cell line derived from human rectum adenocarcinoma. A productive non-cytopathic infection was established, without a previous adaptation, in these cells as shown by the specific hemagglutinating activity in cell culture supernatants. A post-embedding immunochemical technique, using specific antiserum directed against the original egg-adapted virus and colloidal-gold-labelled protein A as the electron-dense marker, was used for the identification of the virus and related antigens in the cells by electron microscopy. Budding of typical coronavirus particles, through intracytoplasmic membranes and accumulation of complete virus within cytoplasmic vesicles or the lumen of rough endoplasmic reticulum, were the main features of the viral morphogenesis. Late in infection, numerous progeny viral particles were shown at the outer surface of infected cells, but budding could not be demonstrated at this level. Two different types of surface projections were observed on the extracellular particles of this avian coronavirus. These morphological characteristics have been thus far described only for mammalian hemagglutinating coronaviruses.",1
"Our objective was to evaluate the level of passive protection against transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) among 57 newborn piglets nursing from seven seropositive sows previously naturally infected with porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV). After challenge exposure we observed mortality rates of 44% for litters of seven PRCV-infected sows, 40% for litters of four sows orally immunized with the attenuated TGEV strain Nouzilly, and 91% for litters of seven seronegative susceptible sows. A blocking ELISA with two appropriate monoclonal antibodies distinguished serological responses of PRCV-infected sows from those of TGEV-immunized sows. The results suggest that natural infection of the sow with PRCV may induce a degree of protective lactogenic immunity against TGE.",1
"A procedure was developed to purify infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) by gel chromatography (GC) with a Sephacryl S-1000 column. Virus samples concentrated by centrifugation were applied to a Sephacryl S-1000 column and eluted by 0.02 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.15 M NaCl. Virus particles were recovered mainly in the first peak. Purity of the samples was evaluated by both sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy. Using electron microscopy, it was found that there were more spike-rich particles in the virus samples purified by GC than in those purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (SDGC). In addition, the hemagglutination unit [log10 (infectivity titer/hemagglutination titer)] of GC-purified virus samples was ∼ 10 times lower than that of SDGC-purified virus samples. These results indicate that Sephacryl S-1000 gel chromatography is useful for purification of IBV.",1
"Monoclonal antibodies to bovine enteric coronavirus (BEC) were produced. Additionally, polyclonal antibodies were made in rabbits and guinea pigs and extracted from the yolk of immunized hens. The antibodies were characterized by neutralization test, hemagglutination inhibition test, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblotting. Neutralizing antibody titers of polyclonal antisera ranged from 1:1280 to 1:40 000. Only one out of 908 hybridoma colonies tested secreted antibodies with neutralizing activity. By ELISA, polyclonal sera exhibited high background reactions that could be significantly reduced by treatment with kaolin in the case of rabbit sera. Attempts to establish an ELISA for BEC antigen detection based on polyclonal sera failed due to low sensitivity and specificity. Optimal results were achieved when a mixture of two monoclonal antibodies was coated onto microplates for antigen capture, while rabbit hyperimmune serum served as detecting antibodies in an indirect assay. The combination of the two monoclonal antibodies did not increase sensitivity synergistically, but in a compensatory fashion, probably because of epitope differences between BEC field strains.",1
"The porcine epidemic coronavirus (PEDV), tentatively classified as a coronavirus, was adapted to Vero cells and a plaque test developed for infectivity titration, allowing us to test the biological and biophysical properties of the virus. Growth kinetics showed peak titers of 105.5 plaque-forming units ml−1 15 h after infection. Filtration experiments and electron microscopy revealed a particle diameter between 100 and 200 nm. The bouyant density of the virus was 1.18. The particle lost its infectivity on treatment with lipid solvents. Virus replication could not be inhibited by 5-iodo-2′-deoxyuridine. PEDV was moderately stable at 50°C, but heat sensitivity was not altered by divalent cations. At 4°C, the virus was stable between pH 5.0 and 9.0, but at 37°C stability was restricted to the pH range 6.5–7.5. Viral infectivity was not impaired by ultrasonication or by multiple freezing and thawing. PEDV was not neutralized by transmissible gastroenteritis virus antiserum. On the basis of the tests carried out, PEDV is a pleomorphic, enveloped RNA virus with a particle diameter of ∼ 150 nm and a bouyant density of 1.18. Infectivity depends on the presence of trypsin, and infected cells show a tendency to fuse and to form syncytia. All of these properties, as well as its physicochemical characteristics, allow PEDV to be classified as a coronavirus.",1
"The antiviral activities of ribavirin (1-β-D-ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide; virazole), either alone or in combination with recombinant human leukocyte (alpha) interferon (rHuIFN-α), were evaluated against feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) in feline kidney-cell cultures. The 50% inhibitory dose (ID50) of ribavirin for uninfected, rapidly dividing cells was ∼17 μg ml−1 whereas the ID50 for FIPV was 2.5 μg ml−1. The therapeutic index (TI) of ribavirin (i.e. the ratio of the minimum cell-toxic dose to minimum virus-inhibitory dose) was 6.8. Although a dose-dependent inhibition of viral infectivity occurred at non-toxic doses, maximum antiviral effects (⩾4 log10 reduction in FIPV) occurred at cytotoxic doses. When low or moderate doses of ribavirin were combined with either 10 or 100 U of rHuIFN-α ml−1, the resulting antiviral effects were significantly greater than the sum of the observed effects from either ribavirin or rHuIFN-α alone. Significant synergistic interactions with rHuIFN-α occurred at ribavirin doses of 1, 5, 12.5 and 25 μg ml−1. Synergistic combinations of rHuIFN-α and ribavirin produced up to an 80-fold or a 200-fold relative increase in FIPV antiviral activities compared with that produced by equivalent doses, respectively, or ribavirin or rHuIFN-α alone. In cell growth studies, the addition of either 10 or 100 U of rHuIFN-α ml−1 to test doses of ribavirin did not increase the anticellular effect observed with ribavirin alone; seemingly, the potentiation of ribavirin antiviral activity by rHuIFN-α was independent of any additive cytotoxic effects. Potentially, synergistic combinations of the two antiviral agents in vivo may decrease the therapeutic dose of ribavirin required for inhibition of FIPV and thus reduce drug toxicity.",1
"A protein A-colloidal gold immunoelectron microscopy (PAG-IEM) technique was developed for the detection of bovine coronavirus (BCV) in the feces and nasal secretions of infected calves. Feces or nasal swab fluids were incubated sequentially with hyperimmune bovine anti-bovine coronavirus serum and protein A-gold, negatively stained, applied to formvar-coated copper grids and viewed using an electron microscope. The PAG-IEM method specifically identified BCV particles and possible subviral particles in feces and nasal-swab fluids from infected calves. The PAG-IEM method did not label other enveloped enteric viruses or morphologically similar fringed particles commonly found in feces. Detection of BCV using PAG-IEM was compared with ELISA and direct immunofluorescence (IF) of nasal epithelial cells by monitoring fecal and respiratory tract shedding of BCV from two experimentally infected and two naturally infected calves from birth to 3 weeks of age. PAG-IEM and ELISA detected shedding of BCV in fecal ( 4 4 animals) and nasal ( 3 4 animals) samples for an average of 5.25 days each. The observed agreement of BCV detection by PAG-IEM and ELISA was 85%. PAG-IEM may be a more sensitive immunoassay for the detection of BCV in diagnostic specimens from infected neonatal calves than ELISA. BCV infection of nasal epithelial cells was detected by immunofluorescence in 4 4 calves, persisted for the duration of the study in 2 4 calves and was sporadic in the other two animals. The observed agreement of BCV detection by PAG-IEM and IF was 57%.",1
"Two direct blocking enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for the detection of antibodies to Breda virus in sera of cattle were compared. An ELISA with consecutive addition of antigen and test serum to an antibody-coated plate gave higher positive: negative absorbence ratios than an ELISA in which antigen and test serum were added simultaneously. Sera collected from breeding and fattening herds in The Netherlands (n = 1313) and the F.R.G. (n = 716) were tested, and antibodies to Breda virus were demonstrated in 94% of adult cattle. Ninety percent of newborn calves had high levels of maternal antibodies, which waned until the age of 3 months. Active seroconversion occurred between 7 and 24 months in most animals.",1
"Bovine astrovirus serotype 2 (US2) was adapted to primary neonatal kidney cell (NBK) cultures by the addition of 50 μg ml−1 of trypsin in the medium. Infectious virus was released from the cells within 7 days post-infection in early passages and within 3 days in later passages. In the absence of trypsin, neither passage infected cells nor release of infectious virus occurred. The virus was shown to be similar to the fecal astrovirus by a neutralization test and by ultrastructural studies of infected cells. Primary embryo bovine kidney (EBK) and NBK cell cultures supported infection with both fecal and tissue culture adapted (TCA) astrovirus. The time-related development of infection, as studied by immunofluorescence, was similar for both fecal and TCA astrovirus and for both cell culture types. The first indication of viral infection and expression of viral antigens occurred at 7 h post-infection and was characterized by the appearance of a diffuse faint immunofluorescence (IF) of the cytoplasm. Soon after, two or three brilliant IF granules were observed in the nucleus, which appeared to involve the nucleoli. Subsequently, dense granular IF was seen in the perinuclear region of the cytoplasm, which later extended to involve all the cytoplasmic area. In both EBK and NBK cultures infected with either fecal or tissue culture adapted astrovirus, only a minority of cells became infected, even when the multiplicity of infections exceeded one. Occasionally 10–20% of cells were infected, but in most cultures the proportion did not exceed 2% and in NBK cultures, from 3 9 calves, no infected cells were observed. The virus did not infect bovine cell lines. Infectivity of the virus was not removed by treatment with chloroform, and iododeoxyuridine and actinomycin D when added to the medium, did not block replication. Masses of virions were observed by electron microscopy in discrete areas in the cytoplasm, with similar distributions as the viral antigen foci as seen by IF. The mean diameter of the virions was 34 nm. In conclusion, bovine astrovirus lacks both essential lipids and an envelope, probably has an RNA genome, may have a nuclear phase of replication involving the nucleoli which is not blocked by DNA inhibitors, and has a selective cell tropism.",1
"An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting serum antibodies to the porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus (PEDV) was established by using cell culture-grown PEDV as antigen for coating. Ultracentrifugation through 20 and 45% (w/w) sucrose cushion proved to be the best antigen purification method. Examination of 1024 swine sera showed a high specificity and a greater sensitivity of the ELISA, when compared with indirect immunofluorescence. Reference sera with high antibody titers to PEDV originated from two pigs experimentally infected with PEDV. Three different antigen purification methods and the advantages of the ELISA compared with an immunofluorescence test are discussed.",1
"This prospective longitudinal study examined the epidemiology and disease syndrome associated with bovine coronavirus (BCV) infections in a cohort of 8 conventional calves from 0 to 120 days of age, in two dairy herds in Ohio. The periods of respiratory shedding of BCV were determined by direct immunofluorescent (DIF) staining of nasal epithelial cells and ELISA of nasal swab supernatant fluids. The periods of fecal shedding of BCV were determined by ELISA and immunoelectron microscopy (IEM). The isotype-specific antibody titers to BCV in serum (at selected intervals between 0 and 120 days of age) and the post-suckling (24 to 48 h after birth) total immunoglobulin levels were examined by ELISA and zinc sulfate turbidity tests, respectively. Of the 8 calves studied, 4 had evidence of BCV respiratory (by DIF or ELISA) or enteric infections (by IEM or ELISA) in association with diarrhea or rhinitis, even though 7 or 8 calves showed increases in one or more serum antibody isotypes to BCV and 6 of 8 calves showed BCV respiratory or enteric antigen shedding by ELISA. Serological antibody titer increases occurred in 3 calves before 30 days of age and in 4 calves after 30 days of age; two of the latter calves had a second rise in serum antibody titers to BCV after the initial rise. A serological antibody titer increase was not observed in one calf. This suggests that BCV infections may be very common in a closed herd and may occur in older calves, although many may be subclinical and some may be recurrent. There were no statistically significant correlations between total serum immunoglobulin levels or BCV antibody isotype titers in serum (24–48 h after birth) and clinical disease or infection by BCV; however, calves with low levels of IgA BCV antibodies in serum (24–48 h after birth) had a significantly greater average number of days with diarrhea than those calves having high levels of IgA BCV-specific antibodies in serum.",1
"The causative agent (TGEV) of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis belongs to the Coronaviridae, a family of enveloped viruses with a positive, single-stranded RNA genome. Important progress has recently been made concerning the molecular biology of TGEV. The research work of our group has been focused on two main aspects: genome structure and functional domains of the envelope proteins. TGEV genomic RNA is organised into seven regions. The sequence of six of them, i.e. the 3′ most 8300 nucleotides, has been established from cDNA clones. Three genes encoding the structural proteins, the peplomer protein E2, the transmembrane protein E1 and the nucleoprotein, have been identified. Additional open reading frames allowed for the prediction of four non-structural polypeptides, the role of which remains to be discovered. The remaining part of the genome (estimated length 20 kb) is thought to encode the polymerase. Expression of TGEV genes involves the production of six subgenomic mRNAs, which together with the virion RNA, form a 3′ terminal nested set. The peplomer glycoprotein E2 (220 kDa) is 1431 residues long and highly glycosylated. Several domains were identified, including a C-terminal anchoring region and at least four major antigenic sites, which cluster in the amino half part of the molecule. Two sites containing most of the critical neutralisation determinants are highly conserved among TGEV strains. The glycoprotein E1 (29kDa) is mostly embedded in the membrane and plays a crucial role in the virion architecture. However, a short N-terminal domain protruding out of the particle mediates complement-dependent neutralisation, and induces alpha interferon synthesis, likely through a direct interaction with the lymphocyte membrane.",1
"One-week-old piglets were inoculated with the porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) either intravenously or directly into the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract. Both inoculation routes resulted in the isolation of virus from the caudal small intestine. Viral replication, however, was only observed upon inoculation into the digestive tract in quantities of ≥ 103 TCID50. Replication remained limited to a few unidentified cells located in or underneath the epithelial layer at villus- or crypt-sites. Virus was excreted in the faeces for several days but infection of the respiratory tract occured rarely in the same pigs. The results of this study indicate that small changes in molecular structure between PRCV and transmissible gastroenteritis virus have resulted in important changes in host cell tropism.",1
"We have performed molecular studies on the pig interferon (IFN) system (i) to analyse the role played by endogenous IFN in neonatal viral enteritis such as transmissible gastroenteritis and possibly to obtain, via recombinant DNA technology, a new anti-infectious and immunomodulatory agent in this species, (ii) to characterize the structure and biological functions of the IFN-like antiviral activity produced by the porcine embryo at the time implantation in the uterus. By probing porcine genomic libraries with human and porcine IFN-α probes to isolate related genes, we have shown that the porcine IFN-α multigene family included, like several other mammalian species, two subfamilies of related but distinct genes. Class I subfamily contains at least 11 loci, located on chromosome no. 1, among which nine have been cloned and two (potentially functional) sequenced. Class II subfamily, which is specifically expressed by the embryo of ruminants before implantation, contains at least seven loci among which six have been cloned. One of the sequenced class I loci: PoIFN-α1 encodes a 189 amino acids (AA) preprotein. After removal of the sequence encoding the putative signal peptide (23 N-terminal AA) this gene was inserted into an Escherichia coli bicistronic expression vector allowing intracellular synthesis of mature porcine IFN-α1 (methionyl IFN-α1). Expression of the recombinant protein was optimized by insertion of a seven base pairs long random synthetic sequence in the intercistronic region, followed by cloning in E. coli and immunodetection of clones expressing high amounts of recombinant protein. The E. coli strain obtained produced high levels of a 18 000 Da protein exhibiting the same in vitro overall biological properties as leucocyte derived porcine IFN (LeuIFN). However, it had a stronger antiviral effect on porcine cells than LeuIFN. After immunoaffinity purification to a specific activity of 5−10 × 107 International Units (IU)/mg of protein, pharmacokinetic and pharmacological studies were realized to determine the in vivo half life of this rIFN-α in the pig. These experiments revealed no major toxic effects in newborn (given 5 × 106IU/kg) or adult (1 × 106IU/kg) pigs. A significant pyrogenic effect (+ 1.5°C) was noted only in the adults.",1
"A recombinant DNA probe with specificity for the 3′ end of genomic RNA from the Ark 99 strain of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was found to hybridize with extracted RNA of three strains with the Ark serotype, as well as the Mass41, Holl52, Gray, JMK, Conn, Fla and SE17 strains of IBV. Viral infection was detected in the cytoplasm of chicken embryo kidney cells inoculated with Mass41, Ark99, SE17 or two recent field isolates of IBV using in situ cytohybridization and a biotinylated probe. In vivo infections were detected in individual cells of tracheas and lungs 2, 4, and 6 days after inoculation of chicks with Mass41 and Ark99. In situ hybridization of Ark99 infected tissue sections using 32P-dATP labelled probe indicated that more viral replication was present in the trachea on day 4 than either days 2 or 6; whereas more viral RNA was found in the lungs on day 6 than days 2 or 4 after inoculation.",1
"A dot blot hybridization assay was developed for use as a rapid screening test to detect bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) in serum from infected cattle. A 1.1. kilobase cDNA, prepared from the BVDV genome, was molecularly cloned and used in this study. Insert cDNA was removed from the pUC9 plasmid vector by Pst-I restriction endonuclease digestion and purified from plasmid DNA by agarose electrophoresis and electroelution. The hybridization probe was prepared by nick translation in the presence of gamma dCT32P and labelled to a specific activity of 2 × 108 cpm/μg of DNA. Specificity was determined by dot blot hybridization of infected cell culture supernate from nine different BVDV strains. The probe hybridized equally with all strains of BVDV tested, which included four cytopathic and five noncytopathic strains of BVDV. Serum was collected from veal calves with respiratory tract disease, unthriftiness, anorexia, and/or poor conditions. Serum samples were treated with nonidet P40 detergent and denatured with formaldehyde and heat prior to application on 1.2 micron nylon membrane filters using a vacuum dot blot apparatus. Hybridization was done under relatively stringent conditions (50% formamide at 42°C). A total of 141 serum samples from different calves were tested and of these samples, 55 (39%) were positive by dot blot hybridization for BVDV RNA. Eight calves (33%) out of 24, tested 3 to 4 weeks later, remained positive for BVDV RNA.",1
A dot blot hybridization assay is described for the detection and differentiation of porcine rotavirus serotypes. Recombinant complementary DNA (cDNA) representing gene 9 (the gene encoding the neutralization antigens in VP7 glycoprotein) from OSU (porcine rotavirus serotype 1) and Gottfried (porcine rotavirus serotype 2) strains were used to determine the optimal hybridization conditions which allow specific detection of group A porcine rotaviruses. Probes were prepared by excision of the inserts from the recombinant plasmids and radiolabeling of cDNA with 32P by the random primer extension method. Probes were hybridized at various stringencies with viral RNA from different rotavirus serotypes bound to nylon membranes. Hybridization at low stringency (26% base pair mismatch for stable hybrid formation) had high sensitivity but low specificity. Hybridization at high stringency (16% base pair mismatch for stable hybrid formation) produced high specificity but decreased the sensitivity observed at low stringency. Probes were specific for rotavirus at both stringencies and did not hybridize with nucleic acids from other porcine viruses. Subgenomic gene 9 fragments were then tested to provide more specific probes. A 322 bp fragment from OSU gene 9 between nucleotides 382 and 704 and a 266 bp fragment from Gottfried gene 9 between nucleotides 230 and 496 were found to be specific as hybridization probes. These studies demonstrated the feasibility of the dot blot hybridization assay using subgenomic fragments of gene 9 to detect and differentiate serotypes of porcine rotavirus. Additional studies are warranted to further evaluate the sensitivity and the capability of these probes to detect porcine field isolates of the same serotype.,1
"Nucleic acid probe technology is increasingly being used in basic research in veterinary microbiology and in diagnosis of infectious diseases of veterinary importance. This review presents an overview of nucleic acid probe methodology and its applications in veterinary infectious diseases. The major applications of nucleic acid probes include detection of pathogens in clinical samples, especially those organisms which are fastidious and difficult to cultivate, differentiation of virulent from a virulent organisms and vaccine strains from wild type isolates, typing of microorganisms mapping genes, screening libraries of cloned DNA for specific genes, detection of latently infected or carrier animals, study of mechanisms of pathogenesis, epidemiological studies and food safety.",1
"A trasmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) coronavirus mutant (188-SG), selected as attenuated and resistant to acidity and proteases of the digestive tract of adult pigs, was used as vaccine (“Nouzilly strain”) in sows to protect suckling piglets against a challenge exposure carried out with a higly virulent TGEV strain. The pregnant sows were immunized once (42–49 days before farrowing) or twice (42–49 and 7–15 days before farrowing) by the oral, intramuscular or conjunctival route with the 188-SG strain. Sows exposed to virulent TGEV in the field and experimentally infected sows (two oral inoculations during pregnancy) were used as positive controls leading to high protection. The neutralizing antibody response to vaccination and/or infection was studied in serum and milk. No protection against mortality was observed in the litters of (1) the nine seronegative, susceptible sows, with piglet mortality of 65/70, (2) the seven once orally vaccinated sows, with mortality of 44/54, (3) the seven sows vaccinated twice by the conjunctival route, with mortality of 55/76. Moderate protection was observed in (1) the eight sows vaccinated intramuscularly twice with piglet mortality of 36/90, (2) the seven orally and intramuscularly vaccinated sows with piglet mortality of 31/51. In contrast, improved protection was observed in (1) the 10 sows vaccinated twice orally, with piglet mortality of 23/95, (2) the four naturally infected sows with piglet mortality of 6/41, (3) the six sows experimentally infected with virulent TGEV with piglet mortality of 1/59. No correlation was found between neutralizing antibodies titers in serum and milk and protection rate of the piglets. The results indicate that relative protective lactogenic immunity against TGEV is induced only by repeated ingestion of -SG attenuated 188-SG strain of TGEV.",1
"Complex trapping blocking (CTB) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and indirect ELISAs for the detection of antibodies to canine parvovirus (CPV), canine coronavirus (CCV) and rotavirus in sera of dogs were established. Double antibody sandwich ELISAs for the detection of CPV-, CCV- and rotavirus antigens in fecal samples were also developed. Both the serological and antigen-detection ELISAs were used to screen samples from dogs in The Netherlands, with or without a history of acute diarrhea. It was shown that the results of the respective serological ELISAs correlated well and that CPV was the major cause of virus-induced acute diarrhea in dogs in The Netherlands.",1
"Two methods of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were developed for the diagnosis of canine coronavirus (CCV) infection in dogs. One ELISA, in which CCV-infected CRFK cell lysate is used as antigen, is for the detection and titration of antibody against CCV, and the other ELISA uses the double antibody sandwich method for the detection of CCV antigen. The first ELISA procedure demonstrated antibody responses in dogs inoculated with CCV, as did the virus neutralization test; the second ELISA detected specific CCV antigen in feces and organ homogenates of inoculated dogs.",1
"This review presents some current thoughts regarding teh epizootiology of the feline coronaviruses; feline infectious peritonisis virus (FIPV) and feline coronavirus (FEVC), with primary emphasis on the pathogenesis of these viruses in nature. Although the mechanism(s) whereby FIPV causes disease are still incompletely understood, there have been significant contributions to the literature over the past decade which provide a framework upon which plausible explanations can be postulated. Two concepts are presented which attempt to clarify the pathogenesis of FIPV and at the same time may serve as an impetus for further research. The first involves the hypothesis, originally promulgated by Pedersen in 19891, that FIPV is derived from FECV during virus replication in the gastrointestinal tract. The second involves a unique mechanism of the mucosal immune system referred to as oral tolerance, which under normal conditions promotes the production of secretory immunity and suppresses the production of systematic immunity. In the case of FIPV infection, we propose that oral tolerance is important in the control of the virus at the gastrointestinal tract level. Once oral tolerance is disrupted, FIPV is capable of systemic spread resulting in immune-mediated vasculitis and death. Thus, it may be that clinical forms of FIP are due to a combination of two events, the first being the generation of FIPV from FECV, and the second being the capacity of FIPV to circumvent oral tolerance.",1
"We have evaluated 24 cytopathic (CP) and 37 noncytopathic (NCP) strains of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) with a dot blot assay using four different genome segments of the NADL strain as hybridization probes (p80, p54, gp53, and gp62). The p80 and p54 probes hybridized to 23/24 (96%) and 22 24 (92%), respectively, of CP strains examined. In contrast, these same two probes only detected 16 36 (43%) and 5 36 (13%), respectively, of the NCP strains examined. The gp53 probe detected 18 24 (75%) and the gp62 probe detected 19 24 (79%) of the CP strains. In contrast, these latter two probes only detected 9 37 (24%) and 7 37 (20%), respectively, of NCP strains. This low detecteion rate of NCP strains suggests a need for developing a probe based on NCP sequences for identification of NCP strains.",1
"We prepared 31 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against either FIPV strain 79-1146 or FECV strain 79-1683, and tested them for reactivity with various coronaviruses by indirect flourescent antibody assay (IFA). Sixteen MAbs which reacted with all of the 11 strains of feline coronaviruses, also reacted with canine coronavirus (CCV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). In many of them, the polypeptide specifity was the recognition of transmembrane (E1) protein of the virus. We succeeded in obtaining MAbs which did not react with eight strains FIPV Type I viruses (showing cell-associated growth) but reacted with FIPV Type II (79-1146, KU-1) and/or FECV Type II (79-1683) viruses (showing non-cell associated growth). These MAbs also reacted with CCV or TGEV. These MAbs recognized peplomer (E2) glycoprotein, and many antigenic differences were found in this E2 protein. These results suggest that FIPV Type II and FECV Type II viruses are antigenically closer to TGEV or CCV than to FIPV Type I viruses. Furthermore, the MAb prepared in this study has enabled discrimination between FIPV strain 79-1146 and FECV strain 79-1683, which was thought to be impossible by the previous serological method.",1
An immunoperoxidase technique performed on the TGEV-infected cells was developed for detection of virus-induced antigens. The presence of M antigen of TGEV on the surface of infected cells was demonstrated by this technique. This finding is in contrast to the M protein of murine hepatitis coronavirus which migrates to the Golgi apparatus but is not transported to the plasma membrane. The time course of appearance M and S antigens on the surface of TGEV-infected cell can be studied by this technique.,1
"The homotypic and heterotypic antibody response to rotavirus was determined in three pony mares and their foals. The normal concentrations of anti-rotavirus antibodies in mares ‘milk and mares’ and foals′ serum over the first 10 weeks post-partum were measured using IgA, IgG and rotavirus sero-type-specific enzyme linked immunosorbent assays. Experimental infection of the foals with serotype 3 equine rotavirus produced a rapid, serotype-specific response which peaked 10 days after infection and a slower heterotypic response which peaked 32 days later. In contrast, vaccination of the mares with an inactivated, adjuvanted serotype 6 bovine rotavirus produced a heterotypic response similar to that of the homotypic response in both serum and milk, although the predominant response in serum was IgG, while in milk it was IgA. These results suggest that non serotype-restricted passive protection of foals against rotavirus may be achieved by parenteral vaccination of mares.",1
We developed a simple agglutination test for the detection of porcine rotavirus in stools from pigs with diarrhea. The virus was detected with high sensitivity and specificity by a slide agglutination test using latex particles coated with antibody against the porcine rotavirus strain OSU (LA-antiOSU). The agglutination of LA-antiOSU with OSU on a glass slide evident macroscopically within 2 min. The sensitivity of this latex agglutination (LA) test was four times higher than that of the electron microscope method. The LA test is available for the rapid diagnosis of porcine rotavirus infections.,1
"Leukocytes were harvested from the peripheral blood, mesenteric lymph node and small intestinal lamina propria from groups of three piglets before, and 1,2 and 3 weeks after infection with virulent transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) at 2 weeks of age. The donor piglets developed clinical signs of transmissible gastroenteritis which persisted for up to 3 days, and they developed peak serum titres of TGEV-neutralizing antibodies 2 weeks post-infection. The leukocytes were cultured in the presence of pokeweed mitogen (PWM), various dilutions of purified TGEV, or control media for 3 or 5 days, and the culture supernatants were tested for antiviral activity in MDBK cells challenged with vesicular stomatitis virus. The antiviral activity was characterized as porcine interferon (IFN)-α or porcine IFN-τ on the basis of its stability at pH 2.0 and neutralization by anti-human IFN-α antibodies. Viability of the leukocytes in culture, determined by trypan blue exclusion, was highest for the peripheral blood leukocytes and lowest for the mesenteric lymph node leukocytes. There were no consistent differences in antiviral activity between cultures incubated for 3 or 5 days. Porcine IFN-α was found in the supernatants of the leukocyte cultures stimulated with TGEV antigen, harvested before or after infection of the donor piglets with TGEV. Porcine IFN-τ was demonstrated in the supernatants of the leukocyte cultures stimulated with PWM, more frequently when the leukocytes were harvested post-infection. This was the first demonstration of IFN induction in vitro in leukocytes from porcine gut-associated lymphoid tissue.",1
Three immunopathological mechanisms may determine the pathogenesis of viral diseases in animals. (1) A variety of viruses causes transient or prolonged immunosuppression by infecting lymphoreticular tissues and interacting with components of the immune system. (2) In persistent viral infections effective immune responses may result in tissue damage. The mechanisms involved are T-cell-mediated destruction of infected cells and delayed-type hypersensitivity. (3) In a number of viral diseases pathogenic immune complexes are formed when antibodies are produced and react with viral antigen molecules persisting in the host. The selected examples of immune dysfunction are the focus of this review.,1
"The antigenic structure of the S glycoprotein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) has been determined and correlated with the physical structure. Four antigenic sites have been defined (A, B, C, and D). The sites involved in the neutralization of TGEV are: A, D, and B, sites A and D being antigenically dominant for TGEV neutralization in vitro. These two sites have specific properties of interest: site A is highly conserved and is present in coronaviruses of three animal species, and site D can be represented by synthetic peptides. Both sites might be relevant in protection in vivo. PRCV does not have sites B and C, due to a genomic deletion. Complex antigenic sites, i.e., conformation and glycosylation dependent sites, have been represented by simple mimotopes selected from a library expressing recombinant peptides with random sequences, or by anti-idiotypic internal image monoclonal antibodies. An epidemiological tree relating the TGEVs and PRCVs has been proposed. The estimated mutation fixation rate of 7 ± 2 × 10−4 substitutions per nucleotide and year indicates that TGEV related coronaviruses show similar variability to other RNA viruses. In order to induce secretory immunity, different segments of the S gene have been expressed using avirulent forms of Salmonella typhimurium and adenovirus. These vectors, with a tropism for Peyer's patches may be ideal candidates in protection against TGEV.",1
"Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) has morphological, physical and biochemical characteristics similar to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the cause of AIDS in man. However, it is antigenically and genetically distinct from HIV; an antigenic relatedness with equine infectious anaemia virus has been demonstrated. FIV has been molecularly cloned and sequenced. Diagnostic tests are commercially available and attempts at preparing inactivated, subunit and molecularly engineered vaccines are being made in different laboratories. During FIV infection a transient primary illness can be recognized, with fever, neutropenia and lymphadenopathy. After a long period of clinical normalcy a secondary stage is distinguished with signs of an immunodeficiency-like syndrome. The incubation period for this stage can be as long as 5 years, during which gradual impairment of immune function develops. Many FIV-infected cats are presented for the first time showing vague signs of illness: recurrent fevers, emaciation, lack of appetite, lymphadenopathy, anaemia, leucopenia and behavioural changes. Later, the predominant clinical signs observed are chronic stomatitis/gingivitis, enteritis, upper respiratory tract infections, and infections of the skin. Neoplasias, neurological, immunological and haematological disorder are seen in a smaller proportion. The immunodeficiency-like syndrome is progressive over a period of months to years. Concomitant infection with feline leukaemia virus has been shown to accelarate the progression of disease. In vitro, phenotypic mixing between FIV and an endogenous feline oncovirus (RD114) has been demonstrated which leads to a broadening of the cell spectrum of the lentivirus. Bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) has been isolated only once, and all attempts to obtain additional isolates have failed; it has been recovered from the leucocytes of cattle with persistent lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy, lesions in the central nervous system, progressive weakness and emaciation. As with the feline representative, BIV also was found to possess a lentivirus morphology and to encode a reverse transcriptase with Mg++ preference; it replicates and induces syncytia in a variety of embryonic bovine tissues in vitro. Antigenic analyses have demonstrated a conservation of epitopes between the major core protein of BIV and HIV. The original isolate has been molecularly cloned and sequenced. Besides the three large open reading frames (ORFs) comprising the gag, pol, and env genes common to all replication-competent retroviruses, five additional small ORFs were found. Numerous point mutations and deletions were found, mostly in the env-encoding ORF. These data suggest that, within a single virus isolate, BIV displays extensive genomic variation. When random cattle sera from the Netherlands were tested by indirect immunofluorescence, Western blot and/or radio-immunoprecipitation, 0.7% appeared seropositive; thus BIV infection is not uncommon in one European cattle population.",1
"Feline calicivirus (FCV) strains isolated from feces (E-FCV) were compared with FCV strains of respiratory origin (R-FCV). All strains were shown to be labile at pH 3.0. All strains except one strain of E-FCV were found to be sensitive to the action of trypsin. When exposed to bile salt (deoxycholic acid sodium salt), all R-FCV strains were markedly inactivated, but none of the E-FCV strains was inactivated. It was possible to select bile-resistant substrains from a bile-sensitive strain.",1
"Viral proteins of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) were extracted from the cytoplasm of infected Vero cells using hypotonic conditions and a non-ionic detergent. Both the pH and the NaCl concentration of the extraction buffer were varied in attempts to increase the solubility of the virion spike glycoproteins (S-protein) and of the nucleocapsid proteins (N-protein). Monoclonal antibodies, hyperimmune sera and convalescent pig sera were used to identify and monitor these proteins by immunoprecipitation and Western blots. The solubility of the S-protein was optimal at pH 4, whereas that of the N-protein was optimal at pH 9. Consequently, it was possible to enrich for either S-protein or N-protein; increases in the NaCl concentration of the buffer were of no advantage in this respect. Enriched preparations of the S-protein and N-protein were used as ELISA antigen for the S-ELISA and N-ELISA, respectively. The S-ELISA proved to be the more effective of the two immunoassays. Antibodies against S-protein remained detectable for longer periods of time than anti-N-protein antibodies in the sera of PEDV-infected pigs. Using this ELISA of increased sensitivity, it was observed that only a small number of farms in Switzerland had been infected with PEDV.",1
"Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) proviral DNA was detected by the polymerase chain reaction method (PCR). PCR products were detected by gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. The P-10, P-15 and P-24 regions of the gag gene of FIV were chosen as the target sequences for amplification, and three primer pairs were prepared. The PCR products subjected to amplification with each primer pair were found to possess sites of digestion by a restriction enzyme, as hypothesized. They did not react with feline leukemia virus (FeLV)-infected or feline syncytium-forming virus (FeSFV)-infected cell-derived DNA, and specifically amplified FIV-infected cell-derived DNA. FIV proviral DNA was detected by the PCR method with either primer pair (one-step amplification: single PCR) in DNA derived from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from 7 of 12 FIV antibody-positive cats. When PCR products in each of the 12 cats were subjected to a second amplification using the same primer pair (two-step amplification: double PCR), FIV proviral DNA was detected in all of the cats. When PBL samples collected from three cats that were negative and three that were positive in the single PCR were cultured for a few weeks in the presence of interleukin 2, FIV proviral DNA was detected in all six cats by the single PCR method. The results suggest that either the use of cultured PBL as the sample or the performance of the double PCR method enables simple and specific detection of FIV proviral DNA in PBL.",1
"An outbreak of neonatal diarrhea occurred among beef calves (2000 animals) from one large Argentinian farm in 1985. Rotavirus was detected in 78% ( 106 136 ) and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli in 1.5% of the samples ( 2 136 ) obtained from sick calves. In comparison rotavirus was identified in only 1.6% ( 1 63 ) of the samples from clinically healthy calves. The rotavirus strain responsible for the outbreak was characterized as serotype 6 belonging to group A. In the following three years the protective capacity of a combined rotavirus—E. coli inactivated vaccines administered to the dams during the last third of the gestation period was evaluated on this farm by comparison of morbidity due to diarrhea in calves from vaccinated vs. placebo cows within the same year. The morbidity due to diarrhea among calves from dams in the vaccinated and placebo groups was 34% and 77%, respectively in 1986; 23% and 47% in 1987, and 15% and 34%, in 1988. In 1987 morbidity of diarrhea in calves born from vaccinated heifers was 54% and 74% in calves from placebo heifers. In 1988 morbidity from diarrhea was 41% and 54%, respectively among calves in these two groups. In all experiments, calves from heifers showed significantly greater morbidity than calves from cows. Differences in diarrhea morbidity between the vaccinated and placebo groups were statistically significant (P<0.05). Additional studies showed that the diarrhea had a significant influence (P<0.05) on the average live weight of the calves at weaning (5 to 7 months) with an average weight loss of 7.8 kg per calf among the calves affected with diarrhea.",1
"Antibodies to a transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV)-related coronavirus have been demonstrated in mink sera by indirect immunofluorescence, peroxidase-linked antibody assays and immunoblotting. This is the first serological evidence of a specific coronavirus infection in mink. The putative mink coronavirus (MCV) seems to be widespread in the Danish mink population with a prevalence approaching 100%. Analysis by immunoblotting has shown that MCV is closely related to TGEV by the spike (S), matrix (M) and nucleoprotein (N) polypeptides. Furthermore, antibodies to MCV also cross-reacted with N and M polypeptides of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). Thus MCV may occupy an intermediate position between the TGEV group of coronaviruses and PEDV. The possibility that MCV may be associated with syndromes of acute enteritis in preweaning mink is discussed.",1
Twelve pigs were experimentally infected with a porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) by the oronasal route. Viral excretion was measured daily by two means-deep nasal swabs and air samples obtained in a cyclone sampler. Clinical signs were very slight on infected pigs. Airborne virus could be recovered from day 1 to day 6 post-infection in the cyclone sampler as well as in petri dishes placed in the same loose-box. Viral titres obtained from nasal swabs were significantly correlated with those obtained from air samples. Different collection media were compared. The most efficient media for the collection of infectious viral particles contained a protective agent such as foetal calf serum.,1
"Three strains of virus isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of sick cats were identified as feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) on the basis of in vitro cytopathic effect, T-lymphotropism, ultrastructural morphology and magnesium-dependent reverse-transcriptase activity. The pathogenic properties of two isolates were studied in 13 experimentally infected cats. The primary phase of infection was characterised by a range of haematological (neutropenia, lymphopenia, presence of atrypical lymphocytes) and clinical alterations (fever, various signs lasting several weeks, generalised lymphadenopathy persisting for several months) and specific seroconversion. A correlation between the inoculated dose of virus and the intensity and duration of clinical signs was observed. The primary phase was followed in the 10 surviving cats by a stage of asymptomatic seropositivity of undetermined duration but which has persisted for over 35 months for the earliest infections. Viruses reisolated several weeks or months after experimental infection retained the same in vitro properties as the initial isolates.",1
"A dot blot hybridization assay, using a biotinylated cDNA probe, was able to detect feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) RNA in Felis catus whole fetus (fcwf-4) cells infected with the FIPV isolates DF2, 79-1146, UCDI, and UCD2. The probe cross-hybridized in the dot blot assay with nucleic acid of a closely related feline coronavirus, feline enteric coronavirus (FECV)-79-1683. To construct the probe, a 2.5 kilobase cDNA, prepared from FIPV-DF2 genomic RNA, was molecularly cloned. The recombinant cDNA clone was digested with the restriction endonuclease Rsa I, and an 870 basepair Rsa I fragment was isolated from vector DNA by agarose electrophoresis and glassmilk purification. This fragment was complementary to the 3′ three fourths of the nucleocapsid gene. The hybridization probe was prepared by random primed labeling in the presence of biotin-11-dUTP. Using an avidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate and chemiluminescent substrate detection system, virus could be detected in as few as 3000 infected cells. In an in vivo study, the probe was used to detect FIPV RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBML) isolated at various post-infection days (PID) from cats experimentally infected with the FIP-producing coronavirus isolate FIPV-79-1146 or FIPV-DF2. Viral RNA could be detected in as few as 12 000 PBML isolated from cats at PID 7 and in 50 000 PBML at PID 22. There was no consistent pattern, however, between hybridization results and prognosis or severity of disease at the time of sampling. Despite some cross-hybridization with FECV RNA, this probe should be useful for diagnosis of FIP, because cats infected with FECV most likely do not become viremic.",1
"Coronaviruses (CV) infect a variety of livestock, poultry and companion animals. They belong to at least five antigenic groups. CV cause localized infections of the respiratory and/or intestinal tracts, with the exception of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIVP) and hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis (HEV) which cause systemic infections. The enteropathogenic CV infect the villous enterocytes resulting in villous atrophy leading to malabsorptive diarrhea. Several CV (bovine CV-BCV, porcine respiratory CV-PRCV, infectious bronchitis virus-IBV) cause respiratory disease. Current evidence indicates that protection against enteric and respiratory CV infections is mediated by passive or active immunity at the primary site of CV replication. Maternal vaccination approaches to induce passive immunity include the use of inactivated and modified live viral vaccines. Modified live viruses and a Ts mutant CV (FIPV) are also used as oral or intranasal vaccines to induce active mucosal immunity. The success of these vaccines in the field is often compromised by a number of potential problems. Coronaviruses are spherical, enveloped viruses, ranging from 80–160 nm in diameter and containing a positive-stranded RNA genome. They possess prominent surface spikes and some species display a fringe of smaller surface projections believed to be the hemagglutinin (HE). Coronaviruses possess 3 to 4 structural proteins: the spike (S) glycoprotein (150–200 kDa), the integral membrane glycoprotein (M; 20–30 kDa) and the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N; 43–50 kDa). A subset of CV (BCV, HEV, turkey CV) possess a third glycoprotein on the virion surface, the HE (60–65 kDa). These proteins can be quantitated using pooled monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to distinct epitopes of each protein in ELISA. Most research has focused on the S protein as a candidate antigen for CV vaccines since it induces virus neutralizing (VN) antibodies. However the HE protein stimulates the production of VN and HE inhibiting antibodies and the M protein induces antibodies that neutralize virus in the presence of complement. Attempts to correlate in vitro VN antibody activity with in vivo protection have shown that the passive transfer of VN mAb to the S or HE protein conferred passive protection against CV challenge in some studies, but not others. Additional research has implicated a possible role for other CV proteins in immunity. Studies of mAb to the M protein of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGEV) have provided evidence for a direct role of the M protein in the induction of αIFN by porcine blood leukocytes. The potential significance of this phenomenon to immunity to TGEV is unclear. Similarly, studies of IBV have suggested that determinants recognized by T cells reside on the N protein and these determinants may be shared among heterologous strains of IBV, resulting in the induction of cross-protection. Thus epitopes on the N protein may be important for induction of cell mediated immunity (CMI). CMI may play an important role in protection of cats against FIPV, since induction of circulating antibodies to the S protein of FIPV contributes to disease pathogenesis by the induction of immune complexes and antibody dependent enhancement of the infectivity of FIPV for macrophages. An increased understanding of antibody and CMI responses following natural CV infections in animals is needed to identify the antigens and epitopes that induce protective immune responses. The expression of CV structural protein genes in various vectors will provide the recombinant proteins needed for future immunogenicity studies in the host species. Furthermore, live rDNA vectors that replicate in the gut and express coronavirus genes may provide a new generation of coronavirus vaccines.",1
"A survey of rotavirus infection in a dairy herd with a history of neonatal diarrhoea was carried out. Faecal samples taken from 15 cows before and after calving as well as faeces taken from their calves daily from birth to two weeks of life were tested for rotavirus by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and compared with an ELISA and a latex agglutination commercial test. Rotavirus excretion was not detected in faeces from cows around parturition by any of the three tests. However, all of their calves shed rotaviruses during the observation period. The onset of rotavirus excretion determined by PAGE ranged from day 2 to day 8 of life (day 4.8± 1.8 on average) and lasted for 4 to 7 days (5.3±1.1 days on average). Chi-square test showed a significant association (P=0.0001) between the presence of rotavirus and the altered consistency of calves faeces. All the three tests showed similar results (overall agreement 92.5%) but discrepancies were detected mainly at the beginning or at the end of the rotavirus excretion period. Results obtained with both commercial kits closely paralleled each other and parameters other than sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic accuracy or predictive values have to be considered as selection criteria.",1
"The level of passive protection against transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was evaluated by experimentally infecting 12 pregnant gilts with different doses of porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) and challenging their litters at 4 days of age. An overall survival rate of 70% was found for piglets nursing the 12 PRCV-infected gilts, compared to a 16% survival rate for piglets of nine uninfected control gilts. Six of the PRCV-infected gilts had adequate levels of immunity to resist infection with TGEV following the challenge of their litters. These six completely immuned gilts also solidly protected their litters from TGEV as shown by a 96% piglet survival rate through weaning at 3 weeks of age. The results suggest that respiratory infection with PRCV induces a substantial degree of protective lactogenic immunity against TGEV.",1
"Twenty-four field isolates of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) were isolated and examined for antigenic and biological characteristics. Most TGEV isolates produced a typical cytopathic effect (CPE) in swine testis (ST) cell culture, which included a ballooning or lifting away of the infected cells from the cell monolayer with heavy granulation evident. Minor variations in CPE were observed with one isolate, IA-145. Protein profiles of the TGEV isolates as determined by SDS-PAGE were essentially identical, with the exception of the isolate IA-101. The TGEV isolate IA-101 presented a higher molecular mass M protein and lacked an N protein doublet that was present in all other TGEV isolates. The TGEV isolates were shown to be closely related antigenically by using hyperimmune sera in a virus neutralization (VN) test. Some antigenic diversity was detected by utilizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in a VN test. Titers of the mAbs were highest with the homologous Miller TGEV, and one virus isolate, IA-156, was very poorly neutralized with the mAbs used in this study. Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) results were similar to those obtained by the VN test. These studies show that some biologic and antigenic diversity exists among TGEV isolates.",1
"Enterocytes were harvested by chelation in a series of seven fractions from the tips of the villi to the crypts of the jejunum of newborn or weaned piglets. Binding of the low cell culture passaged Miller-6 strain of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) to villous enterocytes from newborn piglets was at a high level, similar to that observed to culturedswine test is (ST) cells. Binding of the virus to cryptal enterocytes from newborn piglets or to villous or cryptal enterocytes from weaned piglets was significantly lower. In a competitive virus binding assay with radiolabelled virus, the binding of TGEV to ST cells was found to be saturable, while binding to MDBK cells, in which the virus fails to replicate, was at a lower level and was non-saturable. In the same assay, virus binding to the villous enterocytes from the jejunum of a newborn piglet was saturable, while binding to cryptal enterocytes from a newborn piglet, and to villous and cryptal enterocytes from a weaned piglet, was non-saturable. It was concluded that the high susceptibility of newborn piglets to TGEV infection, and the tropism of the virus for villous enterocytes, may relate to the presence of specific, saturable binding sites on the plasma membrane of villous enterocytes.",1
"Inheritance of resistance to intestinal colonization with E. coli causing oedema disease is hypothetized to be under the control of one locus consisting of two alleles with susceptibility (S) dominating resistance (s). This mode of inheritance was investigated by matting pigs, resistant and susceptible to the disease, and examining the offspring. Weaned piglets were repeatedly inoculated orally with 5 × 105 CFU per pig per day of a streptomycin resistant strain of E. coli serotype O139:K12(B):H1:F(107) and susceptibility determined by daily semiquantitative cultural examination of rectal swabs. Using results obtained from offspring. 5 boars were retrospectively assigned the genotype ss, 1 was assigned Ss, and 2 were assigned SS. Nine sows were designated ss, 8 classified Ss and 4 SS. Ninety two pigs resulted from matings regarded as ss×ss; 89 (97%) of these were resistant to colonization and oedema disease. Of the 168 pigs from Ss×ss matings, 83 (49%) were resistant, while only 13 (9%) of 146 pigs from matings with at least one SS parent were classified resistant. The results are compatible with inheritance being controlled by one locus and with susceptibility dominating resistance to oedema disease.",1
"Feline infectious peritontis (FIP) has been an elusive and frustrating problem for veterinary practitioners and cat breeders for many years. Over the last several years, reports have begun to elucidate aspects of the molecular biology of the causal virus (FIPV). These papers complement a rapidly growing base of knowledge concerning the molecular organization and replication of coronaviruses in general. The fascinating immunopathogenesis of FIPV infection and the virus' interaction with macrophages has also been the subject of several recent papers. It is now clear that FIPV may be of interest to scientists other than veterinary virologists since its pathogenesis may provide a useful model system for other viruses whose infectivity is enhanced in the presence of virus-specific antibody. With these advances and the recent release of the first commercially-available FIPV vaccine, it is appropriate to review what is known about the organization and replication of coronaviruses and the pathogenesis of FIPV infection.",1
"Isolates of Escherichia coli which produce Vero cytotoxin (VTEC) were obtained during 1983–1989 from calves raised in 5 north-central states of the USA. All of the calves experienced intestinal epithelial colonization by VTEC, diarrhea or both; twelve of the calves had bloody diarrhea. Twenty one isolates were serogroup O111 and the others were O103, O69, O45, O26, O5, or non-typable (4 isolates). All but one of the isolates hybridized with the CVD419 probe which identifies most VTEC strains. Thirty two isolates hybridized with the VT1 probe, 3 with both the VT1 and VT2 probes, and one with neither probe. The culture filtrate of the VT probe negative isolate was partially neutralized by SLT I monoclonal antibody. For the other isolates, the results of toxin neutralization by anti-SLT I and anti-SLT II monoclonal antibodies corresponded exactly with the VT1 and VT2 probe hybridization results. Three of the strains adhered in a localized manner to HEp-2 cells and Intestine 407 cells.",1
"Western immunoblots, the kinetics-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (KELA), and the microagglutination test were used to evaluate cross-reactivity among antibodies to serovars of Leptospira interrogans (leptospiral serovars), and B. burgdorferi from naturally infected dogs, and to Serpulina (Treponema) hyodysenteriae from vaccinated rabbits. Whole-cell lysates from Borrelia spp., leptospiral serovars, and Serpulina spp. were used for SDS-PAGE, western blots, and KELA. Cross-reactivity occurred between the antibodies to B. burgdorferi and leptospiral serovars when tested on the heterologous antigens. Antibodies to leptospiral serovars tended to cross-react more strongly with antigens of B. burgdorferi spp. than did antibodies to B. burgdorferi when tested against antigens of leptospiral serovars. The antibodies against B. burgdorferi showed a lesser degree of cross-reactivity to the antigens of S. hyodysenteriae and S. innocens than they did to leptospiral serovars. We conclude that cross-reactivity occurs between B. burgdorferi and leptospiral serovars. Validation and interpretation of ELISA tests for detection of antibody activity to whole cell lysates of the Lyme agent must take this cross-reactivity into consideration. Conversely, dogs infected with the Lyme agent do not show significant cross-reactivity in the microagglutination test for antibody to the leptospiral serovars.",1
"Antigenic differences between European and American isolates of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) were revealed by serologic analysis of a recombinant protein derived from PRRSV open reading frame 3 (ORF 3). The hydrophilic carboxyterminal 199 amino acids encoded by the ORF 3 of a European (Lelystad) isolate of PRRSV were expressed as a recombinant fusion protein (BP03-P) in a baculovirus gene expression system. Sera from gnotobiotic swine exposed to prototypic reference European and American isolates of PRRSV and sera from conventionally reared European and American swine convalescing from naturally acquired PRRSV infections were used to characterize the BP03-P protein. Sera from gnotobiotic and conventionally reared swine exposed to European isolates of PRRSV were significantly more reactive (P < 0.01) with BP03-P than were the corresponding American PRRSV antisera using the indirect immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA). Prototypic European, but not American, PRRSV antisera also recognized BP03-P using western immunoblotting and radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) procedures. However, gnotobiotically derived antiserum to an atypical American-origin PRRSV was reactive with BP03-P by both IPMA and western immunoblot. Despite a predicted potential for N-linked glycosylation, studies with tunicamycin and peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) indicated that BP03-P was not N-glycosylated in either insect cell cultures or Trichoplusia ni larvae infected with the recombinant baculovirus. Sera from rabbits inoculated with BP03-P failed to neutralize both the European (Lelystad) and American (ATCC VR-2332) reference isolates of PRRSV and did not react by IPMA with PRRSV-infected cell cultures. Taken together, the data suggest that the carboxyterminal portion of PRRSV ORF 3 encodes a non-neutralizing viral peptide that is partially responsible for the serologic differences noted between European and most American isolates of PRRSV.",1
"Swine testis (ST) cell cultures were treated with various doses of recombinant human interferon-alpha 2a (IFN), and assayed for 2′,5′ oligoadenylate synthetase (2–5 A synthetase) activity. Treatment with 100 or 1000 units/ml of IFN resulted in increased 2–5 A synthetase activity, but there was no significant response to 1 unit/ml of IFN. Titres of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) were reduced between 6 and 15 hours post-infection in ST cells treated with 1000 or 2500 units/ml of IFN. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of lysates of TGEV-infected ST cells, and of lysates immunoprecipitated with anti-TGEV antibodies, revealed that the synthesis of the N and S proteins of TGEV was reduced in cells treated with 100 or 1000 units/ml of IFN. Viral RNA production, as determined with a probe which hybridized to the S gene of TGEV, was found to be reduced in ST cells treated with 1000 units/ml of IFN, but not in cells treated with 100 units/ml. It was concluded that, in IFN-treated ST cells, TGEV protein production may be decreased in the absence of reduced viral RNA production, and that 2–5 A synthetase may not be a significant factor in the antiviral activity of IFN against TGEV.",1
"Segments of jejunum in 5 to 6 days old piglets were surgically ligated, inoculated with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and 18 hours later the segments were fixed for histology or suspensions were prepared for plaque assay in swine testis (ST) cell cultures to determine the yield of virus. When the virulent Purdue strain of TGEV was used, villous atrophy was seen and TGEV antigen was demonstrated immunohistochemically in the villous enterocytes. The Miller M6 strain of virus produced less extensive lesions in the segments, but since it was titratable by plaque assay it was used in the subsequent yield reduction assays to determine the antiviral activity of interferon. When intestinal segments were inoculated simultaneously with either 3200 units of natural porcine interferon-α or up to 100000 units of recombinant human interferon-α2a, and TGEV, there were no reductions in virus yield, although the same cytokines exerted an antiviral effect in ST cells treated in a similar way. However, virus yields were significantly reduced in intestinal segments in piglets treated parenterally with teh synthetic interferon inducer polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid 6 hours before challenge of the segments with TGEV. There was also a trend for the antiviral effects of interferon induction before challenge to be augmented by the inclusion of interferon with the virus inoculum. It was concluded that interferon would be ineffective as a therapeutic for TGEV, although it might be useful prophylactically.",1
"Two strains of bovine rotavirus (BRV), designated strain Nebraska Scottsbluff-1 (NS-1) and NS-2, were isolated from 2 neighboring cow-calf beef cattle ranches where dams had been vaccinated with a commercial vaccine containing group A BRV strain Neonatal Calf Diarrhea Virus (NCDV)-Lincoln (P1:G6). Nothern blot by hybridizations using whole genomic RNA probes indicated that strains NS-1 and NS-2 had identical group A RNA electrophoretic patterns and were homologous at all gene segments. Strain NS-1 was compared with reference group A BRV strains using serological and genotypic methods. In vitro virus neutralization assays indicated that strain NS-1 was neutralized by a G6-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) and guinea pig hyperimmune serum (GPHS) raised against BRV strain B641 (P5:G6), but not by G10-specific neutralizing mAb or GPHS raised against BRV strain BRV strain B223 (P11:G10). Nucleic acid hybridization experiments using whole-genomic RNA probes revealed that gene segment 4 of strain NS-1 differed from BRV strains NCDV-Lincoln and B223, but hybridized with strain B641. Conversely, gene segment 5 of strain NS-1 hybridized with BRV strain B223, but not with BRV strains NCDV-Lincoln and B641. A G-specific cDNA probe produced by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification of strain NS-1 hybridized specifically only with G6 strains NCDV-Lincoln and B641, but not with G10 strain B223. Co-electrophoresis experiments using strains NS-1, B641, and B223 further confirmed these results, suggesting that strain NS-1 was a naturally-occurring reassortant BRV between strains B641 and B223. Taken together these results indicated that a naturally-occurring group A BRV reassortant with a P gene different from the vaccine virus was responsible for the diarrheal syndrome observed on both ranches. Results from this study also indicate the existence of at least 2 different gene segments 5 among group A BRV infecting cattle.",1
"Canine coronavirus (CCV) is a common faecal agent which is difficult to isolate. This study shows CCV to survive well at temperatures below −20°C but not at temperatures above 4°C. The presence of faecal material markedly reduced CCV survival times at temperatures ranging from 20°C to −70°C. Thus, it is suggested that diagnostic faecal material should be diluted 1:10 (w/v) with growth medium and examined at the earliest opportunity.",1
"An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) was developed. A bovine TGEV-specific polyclonal antibody was purified by affinity chromatography with the TRIO Bioprocessing System and was used as the capture antibody, at a concentration of 1.5 μg/well. The F5.39 monoclonal antibody was obtained by the fusion of spleen lymphocytes from TGEV immunized mice with NS-1 myeloma cells. This mAb was used as a second antibody for the ELISA to detect TGEV in field cases, 53 intestinal samples were taken from pigs exhibiting clinical signs of transmissible gastroenteritis. All the positive samples detected by the ELISA were confirmed as positive by immunofluorescence or cell culture immunofluorescence. To study the ability of this ELISA to detect PRCV in nasal swabs and lung samples, 20 seven-day-old piglets were inoculated with a Quebec strain of PRCV. The ELISA was able to detect PRCV in both kinds of samples.",1
"Feline coronavirus infections in cell cultures and in fresh and fixed feline tissues were detected using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Cell cultures were inoculated with feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), feline enteric coronavirus (FECV)_or sham inoculum. The tissue samples of liver, kidney and spleen were taken from specific-pathogen-free (SPF) cats that were inoculated intranasally with 103 TCID50 of FIPV 79-1146 (n = 10), FIPV UCD1 (n = 3) or sham inoculum (n = 3), from clinical cats (n = 43), and from formalin-fixed archived feline tissues (n = 49), respectively. Additional tissue samples were taken from the FIPV-inoculated cats (n = 6) and were kept at 4°C, room temperatures (20–24°C) and 37°C respectively for 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours before frozen (−70°C) for PCR to evaluate the effects of the ambient temperatures and post-mortem intervals on the test. The samples were also fixed in 10% neutrally buffered formalin, 95% ethanol, and Bouin's solution respectively to evaluate the effects of the fixatives on the test. Positive PCR results were obtained from the cell cultures that were inoculated with FIPV and FECV and from the FIPV-inoculated cats (13/13). Negative PCR results were obtained from the sham-inoculated cell cultures and cats (3/3). Of the 92 clinical cats, 7 of the 8 FIP-suspected cats (87.5%) and 51 of the 84 non-FIP-suspected cats (60.7%) were shown to be virus-positive in at least one of the tissue samples. There was no significant difference in the PCR results between the fresh and the formalin-fixed tissues of the clinical cats (P > 0.05). Of the FIPV inoculated cats, the virus was detectable equally well in fresh and formalin-, Bouin's solution- or ethanol-fixedtissues. However, the amounts of total RNA extracted from the fixed tissues were significantly less than those from fresh tissues (P < 0.01). In tissues that were kept at 4°C, the virus was detectable up to 96 h; at room temperatures, up to 48 h; and at 37°C, up to 24 h, respectively.",1
"Smooth Brucella spp. share certain lipopolysaccharide antigens with other bacteria, resulting in serological cross-reactions which can prevent the definitive diagnosis of brucellosis. To identify other antigens with serodiagnostic potential, immunoblot studies following sodium dodecyl sulphate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were carried out. Sera from pigs experimentally infected with Brucella suis and naturally infected feral pigs, sera from pigs from a farm with a known history of Yersinia enterocolitica 0:9 infection, Brucella Complement Fixation Test (CFT) reactor pigs (aetiology unknown) and pigs from consistently Brucella CFT negative farms were examined. Although B. suis infected pigs recognized a total of nine B. melitensis antigens, individual pigs rarely recognized more than three antigens in the range. A 62 kDa antigen was recognized by the majority (73%) of the Brucella infected pigs, but only by 10 to 23% of pigs from the other groups. This antigen was shown to be the Brucella homologue of the ubiquitous 65 kDa heat shock protein (HSP-65) family by immunoblot studies with 14 monoclonal antibodies to the Mycobacterium leprae HSP-65. Only four of these monoclones (Y1.2, ML-30, D7C and IIIC8) identified the B. melitensis 62 kDa protein suggesting that unshared, potentially Brucella specific, regions exist. Sera from Y. enterocolitica 0:9 infected pigs, CFT reactor pigs (aetiology unknown), CFT negative pigs and hyperimmune pig serum raised to Y. enterocolitica 0:9 also recognized B. melitensis antigens, most notably a 17 kDa protein. This antigen appears to be a common cross-reactive protein.",1
"Antiviral activities of a recombinant feline interferon (rFeIFN) KT-80 were evaluated against feline enteropathogenic viruses in feline and canine cell lines. Sensitivity to antiviral activities of the rFeIFN varied with cell types; Felis catus whole fetus (fcwf-4) cells were more sensitive than Crandell feline kidney cells, but no sensitivity was found for Madin-Darby canine kidney cells when vesicular stomatitis virus was used as a challenge virus. Reductions were generally IFN dose-dependent and were more consistent when the cells were continuously treated with the rFeIFN than when they were pretreated only before viral challenge. Compared with each virus control culture of fcwf-4 cells, yields of rotavirus, feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV), feline calicivirus and feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus were reduced by ranges of 1.3 to ⩽3.1 log10, 0.6 log2, 0.8 to 3.7 log10 and 0.5 to 0.6 log10, respectively, in the cultures continuously treated with 10 to 10000 U of the rFeIFN. The yield reduction of FPLV was considered to be in part attributable to inhibition of cell growth by the rFeIFN supplemented in the medium.",1
"The interferon (IFN)-inducing capacities of intact NDV virions, β-propiolactone-inactivated particles and several structural components were compared, using human PBML as the IFN producing cells. Intact and inactivated virions as well as the nucleocapsid fraction did not differ significantly in their IFN-inducing capacity. In contrast, genomic RNA as well as M protein fraction and envelopes induced IFN titres to a level of about 10% of those achieved with virions. NDV-induced IFN production could be blocked specifically by incubation with polychonal anti-NDV-monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and with two of three anti-HN-mAbs, but not with anti-NDV-mAbs directed against the F, M or NP protein. In addition, IFN induction by fixed MDBK cells, expressing NDV surface proteins after infection with NDV Ulster, was inhibited by one of two anti-F-mAbs. The results suggest that the induction of IFN synthesis in human PBML is a complex process involving not only the HN protein but also the uncleaved F protein precursor, a component of the M protein fraction and — once having entered the cell — the genomic RNA.",1
"Canine distemper virus (CDV) invades the nervous system and replicates in neurons and glial cell of the white matter during a period of severe viral induced immunosuppression. Demyelination occurs in infected white matter areas in the absence of inflammation. The mechanism of demyelination is not apparent because there is no ultrastructural evidence of viral replication in the oligodendrocytes, the myelin producing cells. However, brain tissue culture studies have shown that oligodendrocytes support transcription of all CDV genes and later on degenerate, although no viral proteins can be found in these cells. It remains to be shown how such a restricted infection leads to demyelination. Concomitant with immunologic recovery during the further course of the disease, inflammation occurs in the demyelinating lesions with progression of the lesions in some animals. A series of experiments in vitro suggested that chronic demyelination is due to a bystander mechanism associated with the virus-induced immune response in which antibody dependent cell-mediated reactions play an important role. The progressive, or even relapsing, course of the disease is associated with viral persistence in the nervous system. Persistence of CDV in the brain appears to be due to non-cytolytic selective spread of the virus with very limited budding. In this way CDV escapes immune surveillance.",1
"Control of canine distemper can realistically only be achieved by the use of vaccination. The types of vaccine in current use are described, together with some of the problems encountered such as interference by maternal antibodies, and usage in species other than dogs. Modified live viral vaccines, as used for more than thirty years, have proved very effective. Nevertheless there is scope for some improvement in vaccine efficacy and recent developments in genetic recombinant methods are described.",1
"Faecal samples from 112 dogs both with and without diarrhoea were screened for parvovirus by a haemagglutination titration test and then examined by electron microscopy for the presence of viruses and virus-like particles. On the basis of morphology eight distinct viruses or virus-like particles were identified. Particles identified were coronaviruses, coronavirus-like particles, rotavirus-like particles, papovavirus-like particles, torovirus-like particles, picornavirus-like particles, 27 nm virus-like particles with projections and parvovirus-like particles which did not cause haemagglutination.",1
"Diarrhoeic faeces from about 500 dogs were examined by negative stain electron microscopy. As well as parvovirus, and some of the other recognised viral causes of gastroenteritis, unusual “virus-like” particles were observed in about 8% of the samples. The particles were spherical, 100 nm to 300 nm in diameter, and surrounded by a thick wall penetrated by numerous pores. An additional 74 samples of normal faeces yielded no “virus-like” particles. We do not know the nature of these particles.",1
"Four avian heterophil antimicrobial cationic peptides (Chicken Heterophil Peptides 1 and 2, and Turkey Heterophil Peptides 1 and 3) were evaluated for in vitro microbicidal activity against selected avian pathogens and human pathogens which are harbored by birds. At concentrations of 16-2 μg/ml, all four avian peptides effected a greater than 90% reduction in the survival of Candida albicans, Salmonella enteriditis, and Campylobacter jejuni. None of the peptides, including the known antimicrobial peptide protamine (used as a positive control), were able to reduce the survival of Pasteurella multocida by 90% at the maximum peptide concentration (16 μg/ml) tested. At 16 μ/ml, the turkey peptide THP3 did not effect a 90% reduction in survival of Bordetella avium, Escherichia coli, or Salmonella typhimurium, while all of the other peptides tested were effective at this concentration or less. This peptide, THP3, does not share the same homologous amino acid sequence shared by the other three peptides. Under our experimental conditions, none of the peptides neutralized Infectious Bronchitis Virus, an enveloped coronavirus of chickens.",1
"The spike protein from transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was expressed in attenuated S. typhimurium Δcya Δcrp Δasd χ3987. Three partially overlapping fragments of TGEV S gene, encoding the amino-terminal, intermediate, and carboxy-terminal end of the protein, as well as the full length gene were inserted into the asd + plasmid pYA292 to generate recombinant plasmids pYATS-1, pYATS-2, pYATS-3, and pYATS-4, respectively, which were transformed into S. typhimurium χ3987. Recombinant S. typhimurium χ3987 (pYATS-1) and χ3987 (pYATS-4) expressing constitutively a 53 kDa amino-terminal fragment of the S protein and the full length protein (144 kDa), respectively, showed high stability. After 50 generations in vitro 60% and 20% of the bacteria transformed with pYATS-1 and pYATS-4, respectively, expressed the S-protein antigen. Since S. typhimurium χ3987 (pYATS-1) showed a better level of expression and stability in vitro, this recombinant strain was selected as a potential bivalent vector to induce both immunity to Salmonella and TGEV in swine. In order to study colonization of swine tissues by S. typhimurium Δcya Δcrp, a gene conferring resistance to rifampicin was cloned into the chromosome of S. typhimurium χ3987, generating χ4509 strain. Both S. typhimurium χ4509 (pYA292) and χ4509 (pYATS-1) colonized the ileum of orally inoculated swine with clearance of bacteria between days 10–20 post-infection. The expression of the amino-terminal fragment of the S protein diminished the ability of S. typhimurium χ4509 (pYATS-1) to colonize deep tissues. The recombinant strain S. typhimurium χ3987 (pYATS-1) induced TGEV specific antibodies in both serum and saliva of orally inoculated swine. This strain, as well as S. typhimurium χ3987 (pYA292), also elicited both systemic and mucosal immunity to Salmonella antigens.",1
"Dual infections of pigs with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) followed by a second common respiratory virus, either porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) or swine influenza virus (SIV), were studied. The aim was to determine if dual infections, as compared to single virus infections, result in enhanced clinical manifestations. It was also examined if PRRSV replication affects replication of PRCV or SIV in the respiratory tract. Groups of conventional 10 week old pigs were inoculated with PRRSV-only (3 pigs), PRCV-only (4 pigs) or SIV-only (4 pigs). Dual inoculations with PRRSV-PRCV (4 pigs) and PRRSV-SIV (3 groups of 4, 4 and 5 pigs) were performed at a 3 day interval. A group of uninoculated control pigs (8 pigs) was included. The infection with PRRSV-only induced a transient fever (40.2°C) at 2 DPI, but no respiratory signs. The PRCV-only infection remained subclinical. The SIV-only infection resulted in a one day fever (40.1°C) with moderate tachypnoea and dyspnoea. Mean weight gain in the virus-inoculated groups was retarded compared with the control group. The PRRSV-PRCV infection induced a 9 day lasting fever (peak 40.9°C) with tachypnoea, dyspnoea and productive coughing. The PRRSV-SIV infection resulted in fever and respiratory signs in all 3 groups. Clinical signs, however, were more pronounced in group 1 than in groups 2 and 3. Pigs of group 1 showed fever during 10 days (peak 41.4°C), tachypnoea, marked dyspnoea with abdominal breathing, and a productive cough. Pigs of groups 2 and 3 had fever for 5 and 3 days (peaks 40.6 and 40.3°C) respectively and mild respiratory disorders. Mean weight gain during 14 DPI of the 2nd virus was 5.9 kg in the PRRSV-PRCV group and 4.0, 6.8 and 6.7 kg in PRRSV-SIV groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Mean weight gain during the corresponding period in the PRRSV-only group was 8.6 kg. It was concluded that dual infections with viruses causes more severe disease and growth retardation than single PRRSV infection. PRCV excretion curves were similar in single and dual virus inoculated groups. Excretion of SIV was delayed by 2 days in the dual inoculated pigs. Thus, replication of the second virus is not (PRCV) or only slightly (SIV) affected by a prior infection with PRRSV.",1
"Anti-idiotypic antibodies (anti-ids) have been used successfully in studies on bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) receptor(s) in our laboratory. The anti-ids specifically bound to cultured cells and identified a 50 kDa cellular membrane protein, which is thought to be a specific receptor for BVDV. In this study, flow cytometric analyses demonstrated that the anti-ids also specifically bound to different cell types, namely MDBK, EBK, BT, PK15, MA104, and Vero. Experiments on virus attachment and replication showed that BVDV adsorbed to all cells and replicated in them except monkey kidney cells MA104 and Vero (non-permissive). Results from plaque reduction assays indicated that cellular membrane proteins from all cell lines competitively inhibited BVDV attachment to cultured MDBK cells, suggesting the presence of BVDV receptor on all cells. Immunoblotting of cell membrane proteins with the anti-ids revealed a 50 kDa protein in both permissive and nonpermissive cells. Subcloned or synchronized MDBK cells demonstrated no significant difference of binding with anti-ids as compared to normal cultured cells.",1
"The sudden appearance of apparently new viruses with pathogenic potential is of fundamental importance in medical microbiology and a constant threat to humans and animals. The emergence of a “new” pathogen is not an isolated event, as for instance the frequent appearance of new influenza virus strains demonstrates. Often the new virus strains co-circulate with the older strains in a susceptible population, but a replacement of the older strains has been also observed. In rare instances the new viruses can cause dramatic epidemics or pandemics, such as those observed with the human immunodeficiency virus, canine parvovirus, or most recently, with the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United Kingdom. The mechanisms of the emergence are not always clearly understood, but an altered host range appears to be a common event. Whether a true change in host range occurs, or whether the virus adapted to the host and replicated more efficiently, is often unknown. This review tries to summarize the facts that are known about a wide variety of “new” viruses of mammals, such as the simian, human and feline lentiviruses, the feline coronaviruses, the feline parvoviruses, the carnivore morbilliviruses, the influenza A viruses, and the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. A particular emphasis will be put on the genetic mechanisms that might have taken place and that might have been responsible for their sudden appearance.",1
"Six monoclonal antibodies raised against feline calicivirus (FCV) strain F9 were used in an enzyme-linked immuno-flow-assay (ELIFA) to analyse 55 isolates of FCV. Forty seven field isolates were obtained from cats with acute oral/respiratory disease, chronic oral lesions, and from cats showing vaccine reactions, i.e. clinical signs of FCV infection shortly after vaccination. Eight reference strains including F9 and three vaccine strains based on F9 were also examined. All of the strains of F9, derived from various sources, reacted with all six of the monoclonal antibodies, whereas some of the field isolates did not react with any. In general, the field isolates showed a spectrum of reactivities and selected isolates could be distinguished. However, there were no clear cut differences between the clinical groups. Overall, the oral/respiratory group showed less reactivity with the monoclonals, suggesting they were less related to F9. Although the other groups appeared to be more closely related to F9, none of the isolates reacted with all six monoclonal antibodies.",1
"Serum-virus neutralizing antibodies were detected in serum and colostrum of sows vaccinated during pregnancy with commercially available vaccines against eastern equine encephalomyelitis virus (EEEV), and antibodies were detected in serum from nearly all pigs from vaccinated sows flllowing colostrum uptake. Serum-virus neutralizing antibody (SVN) test titers were measured in colostrum and pigs at the next farrowing, and additional vaccination of sows prior to the third farrowing led to elevated SVN titers in serum, colostrum and all pigs. Six pigs from vaccinated sows challenged at 8 to 9 days of age with 1 × 106 TCID50 EEEV did not develop the high temperatures or signs of central nervous system disease that 6 pigs from non-vaccinated sows developed. Virus was isolated from blood and oropharyngeal swabs from all pigs from non-vaccinated sows with blood virus titers as high as 9.3 × 104 TCID50, while only low levels of virus were detected in blood and oropharyngeal swabs from pigs from vaccinated sows. Virus was also isolated from tonsils collected at necropsy from 3 pigs from non-vaccinated and 1 pig from vaccinated sows. Vaccination of pregnant sows leads to development of maternal antibodies that are transmitted via colostrum to pigs and are protective against clinical EEEV related disease after experimental challenge with EEEV. In addition, vaccination prevents amplification of virus in infected pigs and could result in protection of animals and farm labor in the environment of infected pigs.",1
"To investigate whether a normal resident microbiological flora of conventional rats influences the lethality of chemical-induced lung damage, the pneumotoxin O,S,S-trimethyl phosphorodithioate (OSSMe, 75 or 100 mg/kg, s.c.) was administered to age-matched conventional and germ-free male F344 rats. Microbiological and serological examinations confirmed the germ-free state of the germ-free rats and showed that no specific lung pathogens were present in the conventional rats. As in conventional rats, clinical symptoms and death of OSSMe-treated germ-free rats resulted from respiratory failure. The germ-free rats were not more resistant, but rather more susceptible to OSSMe than conventional rats. Increases in lung weight and histological examination of lung tissue 3 days after dosing with OSSMe (75 mg/kg, s.c.) showed no differences between germ-free and conventional rats. Despite alterations in their nasopharyngeal flora, death in the conventional rats was probably not caused by bacterial superinfection. The higher susceptibility of germ-free rats to OSSMe can be partly attributed to pharmacokinetic differences, since plasma levels of OSSMe decreased more slowly in germ-free than in conventional rats. It is concluded that germ-free rats are not protected from the lethal consequences of acute chemical-induced lung damage.",1
"The consequences of natural infections by bovine virus diarrhoea virus (BVDV) in a dairy herd comprising approximately 60 cows were studied over a 3 year period. The outcome of 39 pregnancies after artificial insemination or natural service during a 4 month period of risk for contracting BVDV was nine abortions, one mummified foetus, one still-birth, three calves that died within 1 week of age, 12 calves persistently infected (PI) with BVDV (11 males and one female) and 13 non-PI calves. Retrospective studies showed that only two of the 13 dams (15.4%) of non-PI calves had been inseminated once, which is a significantly (P < 0.001) lower rate than for 192 other gestations (66.7%) during the 3 year period. The gestational duration of multiparous cows (but not of heifers) was longer (P < 0.01) for five cows with PI calves (mean ± SD 287.6 ± 9.5 days) than for 53 other gestations in 35 cows (280.6 ± 3.8 days). Five of the 12 dams of the PI calves had not expelled the foetal membranes within 2 days after calving, which is a higher (P < 0.001) incidence than the seven cases of retained placenta observed after 198 other calvings. Furthermore, there was a 4.4-fold higher risk (P < 0.01) of treatment for enteritis and/or pneumonia in calves and a 6.0-fold higher risk of calf mortality associated with the introduction of BVDV. The mean heart girth of the PI calves was less (P < 0.05) than that of non-PI calves, at both 80 and 180 days of age.",1
"This review has shown that a variety of chromatographic techniques are available for fractionating proteins. Fortunately, high-quality columns of every type described in this review are commercially available. Most water-soluble proteins may be eluted from size-exclusion, hydrophobic-interaction, ion-exchange, metal chelate, and bioaffinity columns with ease. When this is the case, high recovery and retention of biological activity are the norm. The exception is reversed-phase chromatography where the organic solvents and acids used in polypeptide elution denature many proteins. When problems do occur, they are generally the result of unique structural features of the protein. Very hydrophobic proteins have presented the biggest problem in that they are difficult to solubilize, particularly with retention of biological activity. It has been found that zwitterionic an non-ionic detergents are the most suitable solubilizing agents, but area has also been used in cases where hydrophobic interacts are not as strong. Unfortunately, there is still an element of trial-and-error in selecting the most suitable solubilizing agent. Heterogeneous glycosylation of proteins also presents a problem. Both neutral and charged monosaccharides can be incorporated into proteins through multiple steps at several sites. Thus, there is the potential in a sample for a large number of glycoprotein species which have the same polypeptide backbone and differing amounts of oligosaccharide. A problem arises when size-exclusion, ion-exchange, hydrophobic-interaction, reversed-phase and bioaffinity systems begin to discriminate between these very similar glycoprotein species. Chromatographic peaks can become very load, due to incomplete fractionation, and the polypeptide chain of interest can be associated with multiple peaks. The separation of glycoproteins requires much more study before logical procedures can be suggested for column selection and operation. Aggregated species are another class of proteins which present occasional problems. Multimeric proteins are adsorbed to sorbents by a series of forces, among which are hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and electrostatic forces. These forces are also responsible for the maintenance of quaternary structure in proteins. When the same forces dominate both retention of protein structure and adsorption at the sorbent surface, the quaternary structure of the protein can be disrupted during elution. Very basic proteins also present a problem in some cases. Columns with residual negative charges, such as a silica-based reversed-phase column, adsorb anionic species so strongly that they are difficult to elute. This is the case with ribosomal and nucleoproteins. The solution is to use exhaustively end-capped columns which diminish electrostatic interactions.",1
"Biological membranes have as a major function the compartmentation of biological processes in cells and organelles. They consist of a bilayer of phospholipid molecules in which proteins are embedded. These integral membrane proteins, which cross the bilayer once or several times, generally have a higher than average hydrophobicity and tend to aggregate. Detergents are needed to remove integral membrane proteins from the lipid bilayer and they have to be present during further chromatographic purification. Predominantly, four modes of HPLC have been used alone or in combination for the puridication of integral membrane proteins. These are based on differences of proteins in size (size-exclusion chromatography, SEC), electrostatic interaction (ion-exchange chromatography, IEC), bioaffinity (bioaffinity chromatography, BAC) and hydrophobic interaction (reversed-phase chromatography, RPC, and hydrophobic-interaction chromatography, HIC). SEC, IEC, BAC and HIC are used under relatively mild conditions, and buffer systems generally contain a non-ionic detergent. RPC generally has a denaturing effect on the protein and should preferably be used for the purification of integral membrane proteins smaller than 50 kD.",1
"In this second part of a two-part review, the absorption and delivery of peptide and protein drugs via non-parenteral routes are discussed. Approaches considered include the absorption enhancers, iontophoretic methods, the use of absorption inhibitors and prod rugs.",1
"One hundred methanolic plant extracts were screened for antiviral activity against seven viruses. Twelve extracts were found to have antiviral activity at the non-cytotoxic concentrations tested. The extracts of Rosa nutkana and Amelanchier alnifolia, both members of the Rosaceae, were very active against an enteric coronavirus. A root extract of another member of the Rosaceae, Potentilla arguta, completely inhibited respiratory syncytial virus. A Sambucus racemosa branch tip extract was also very active against respiratory syncytial virus while the inner bark extract of Oplopanax horridus partially inhibited this virus. An extract of Ipomopsis aggregata demonstrated very good activity against parainfluenza virus type 3. A Lomatium dissectum root extract completely inhibited the cytopathic effects of rotavirus. In addition to these, extracts prepared from the following plants exhibited antiviral activity against herpesvirus type 1: Cardamine angulata, Conocephalum conicum, Lysichiton americanum, Polypodium glycyrrhiza and Verbascum thapsus.",1
"The analysis of 26 longevity curves of different populations of inbred (Fischer 344) and outbred (Sprague-Dawley) rats highlighted a remarkable between-populations variability in survival parameters. This variability is independent of the breeding characteristics of the strain. The two strains differed in the slope of the survival curves, with Fischer 344 rats showing a higher survival over the second year of life as well as a lower interindividual variability. A model-free approach based on principal component analysis allowed us to quantify these differences and to highlight some limitations of the classical Gompertzian approach.",1
"During an 8-yr period, 862 stool specimens from patients with gastroenteritis were examined by electron microscopy after negative staining with 2% phosphotungstic acid (pH 6.5). Forty-one percent of the specimens submitted over an 8-yr period were determined to be positive for virus or viruslike particles belonging to one or more of seven morphologically distinct viral groups. Coronavirus-like particles (CVLPs) were present in 69.8% of the positive stool specimens. Membranous profiles containing “complement-type” holes (10 nm in diameter) were identified in some preparations containing CVLPs. The second most prevalent viral agent found in stool specimens was the rotavirus (17% of all positive stools). The incidence of other viruses identified in the survey were as follows: adenovirus 4.5%, picorna/parvovirus agents 2.9%, Norwalk-like agent 2.9%, astrovirus 1.9%, and calicivirus 0.5%. Unclassified small round viruses (≈25–30 nm in diameter) represented 0.5%. It was also determined that there was a seasonal distribution in excretion of all viruses except for CVLPs. A greater number of viruses were identified in the cooler, drier months of the year.",1
"Fecal samples submitted for virus examination over July 1990 to June 1991 from children <3 years of age were examined by electron microscopy (EM), virus culture (VC), and enzyme immunoassay [EIA, group-reactive and adenovirus (Ad) 40/41 specific; Cambridge BioScience] to compare the detection rate of adenovirus from pediatric fecal specimens. Ad isolates of serotypes 1–7 grown in HEp-2 or primary rhesus monkey kidney cells were identified by neutralization. Graham 293 cell cultures were used only when specimens were found to be positive for Ad by EM, type-specific Ad40/41 EIA, and for isolates not identified by neutralization. Ads grown in 293 cells were identified by DNA restriction endonuclease analysis. Of the 1187 specimens examined, 105 (9%) were found to be positive for Ad. VC detected 93, while 12 additional positives were detected by EM or EIA. The relative sensitivity of VC, EIA, and EM for the 105 specimens was 89% (93), 45% (47), and 35% (37), respectively. Among the 105 positive specimens, enteric Ad, nonenteric Ad, and untypeable Ad were 28% (29), 65% (68), and 7% (8), respectively. Of 37 EM positives, 62% (23) were enteric Ad; 27% (10) were nonenteric including serotypes 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, and 31, with 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, and 1 isolates of each type positive, respectively; and 11% (4) were detectable only by EM. Five isolates were identified as variant of Ad 2(3), Ad 3(1) and Ad 31(1). Over a 1-year period, a single Ad41 variant strain was the most frequently detected enteric Ad in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. For maximum detection rates of Ad viruses in pediatric fecal specimens, a combination of EM, VC, and EIA is required, but group-reactive EIA, or EM followed by Ad40/41-specific EIA of initial positives, are the most direct and efficient methods for enteric Ad detection.",1
"Methods to make long and reliable cDNA from viral RNA template have been optimized. The conditions of the denaturation of the viral RNA template were most critical. For synthesis of the first DNA strand, the concentration of the primer and the presence of an RNase inhibitor were important. During the synthesis of the second strand, the incubation temperature was found to have effect on the length of the transcripts. Application of our optimized conditions on coronaviral genomic RNA as template resulted in cDNA libraries with inserts in the range of 0.5–5 kb without a separate cDNA size selection. Furthermore, a convenient variant of the alcohol precipitation and the analysis of single-stranded DNA on neutral agarose gels are described.",1
"Acute pharyngitis is frequently encountered in the ambulatory care setting. Although usually of viral etiology, streptococcal disease is the focus of diagnostic efforts, in light of significant suppurative and nonsuppurative sequelae. The traditional symptoms of fever, adenopathy, and pharyngeal exudate are suggestive, but not diagnostic of streptococcal pharyngitis. Thus, the importance of diagnostic testing, including Group A beta hemolytic strep antigen screen and culture, is emphasized. Recent innovations in therapy include modification of antibiotic dosing regimens and use of cephalosporins to improve patient compliance.",1
"Schwann cells are able to migrate into the CNS and myelinate CNS axons in a number of developmental and pathological situations. Morphological studies based on normal, mutant and experimentally-lesioned tissue have indicated that Schwann cells are only able to enter the CNS when the integrity of the astrocytic glia limitans is disrupted. The significance and subtlety of the interactions between Schwann cells and astrocytes have been further explored by glial cell transplantation studies. These studies support in vitro observations on Schwann cell behaviour in highlighting the importance of extracellular matrix for both migration and myelin sheath formation. The failure of Schwann cells to intermix with astrocytes is an important aspect of glial cell biology which will have a bearing on efforts to remyelinate demyelinated axons by Schwann cell-transplantation.",1
"Cells resident within the central nervous system (CNS) can synthesize, secrete and respond to inflammatory cytokines not only contributing to the responses to injury or immunological challenge within the CNS, but also regulating their own growth and differentiation potential. The actions and cell communication via cytokines in the CNS are designated as the CNS cytokine network, in which microglia and astrocytes play the central roles. To further characterize the CNS cytokine network we investigated the differences in roles of these cells, and found that microglia might contribute to the early phase of cytokine production reaction and that astrocytes might contribute the late phase of the reaction. We also investigated roles of inhibitory cytokines such as TGF β, IL-4, and IL-10, and showed that each might play a distinct role in the inhibitory regulation in the CNS. We summarized our previous report about cellular distribution of cytokine receptors in the CNS cells and discussed their roles in the CNS cytokine network. Finally, we investigated that expression of IL-6 and IL-2 receptors in neuronal and oligodendrocytic differentiation, respectively. From these results, we discussed the features of the CNS cytokine network.",1
"Virus-like particles not previously described were observed in a human gastroenteritis stool using negative-stain TEM. The stool was among a number of acute-phase illness stools which had been collected in Egypt during 1980. The particles measured 65–70 nm in diameter, and it was possible to detect individual capsomeres on many of these particles. The capsomeric pattern identified on the particles corresponded to an icosahedrally symmetric T = 19 capsid. Distinctive five-fold vertices, usually appearing as darker spots on the capsid, were an additional feature of these particles. The capsid structure, which is skew, could readily be distinguished from the T = 25 capsid of adenovirus and the holey capsids of rotavirus and reovirus. Antibody to the particles was detected in both the shedding individual's acute- and convalescent-phase serum specimens using IEM, although an antibody increase was not demonstrated.",1
"Viruses have unique morphology and are therefore good candidates for negative staining. Negative staining with phosphotungstic acid (PTA) or uranyl acetate has facilitated the detection of many viruses in clinical specimens. Enhancement procedures have included the use of centrifugation and agar diffusion for concentrating virus particles, the use of solid phase capture reagents to trap virus particles and the use of secondary antibodies and electron dense markers to help visualize them. Techniques currently in use and employing negative staining include direct EM, immune electron microscopy (IEM), solid phase immune electron microscopy (SPIEM), colloidal gold-labeled protein A (PAG), solid phase IEM employing a second decorator antibody (SPIEMDAT), and solid phase IEM using colloided gold-labeled secondary antibodies (SPEIMDAGT). IEM methods assist with the detection of small viruses or viruses present in low numbers while PAG offers increased sensitivity over direct EM and IEM. In our experience the serum-in-agar (SIA) method is the most sensitive of the PAG IEM techniques for detection of rotavirus particles in clinical specimens. SPIEMDAT enhances the detection of small viruses which are often missed by other techniques due to background staining in specimens. SPEIMDAGT employing colloidal gold-labeled secondary antibody has increased sensitivity and offers the advantage of detecting viral antigen when whole virus particles are not visible. IEM techniques have recently been used for typing viruses using either monospecific antisera or monoclonal antibodies and colloidal gold-labeled secondary antibody.",1
"Analogies are drawn between important unknowns in AIDS and alcohol research, related to underlying common pathogenetic mechanisms, immunodysregulation, cofactors, and prominent vascular manifestations. The central role of the blood and lymphatic vasculatures and specifically their endothelial lining in many facets of the immune response is reviewed. Evidence is presented that both alcohol and HIV (as well as other coinfecting viruses in AIDS) target and alter endothelial cells and the angiogenic process. These concepts are further illustrated by a serendipitous viral epidemic among rats on continuous long-term alcoholic and control nonalcoholic diets, where synergism between alcohol and virus appeared to underlie multiple vascular proliferative lesions in the liver. In AIDS and alcoholism/alcoholic liver disease (ALD), the prominent features of dysregulated angiogenesis point to the endothelium as a key player in pathogenesis of these seemingly disparate disorders and potentially in immunomodulation.",1
"Partially purified preparations of mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV3) agglutinated fowl, day-old chick, ferret, hamster and human O erythrocytes at 4, 20 and 37°C and mouse erythrocytes at° C.",1
"Cultures of human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) and human glioblastoma (U87-MG) were compared for their ability to sustain a persistent infection with coronavirus OC43. Within 28 days, infectious virus and hemagglutinin were being produced at high levels in both types of cells. Temperature sensitive plaque variants were recovered at 31 °C. In both cell types, the virus caused increased antigen synthesis and cell death, if the temperature was lowered to 31 °C. Infectious virus was lost if cells were treated with antiserum to whole virus or if the temperature was raised to 39.5 °C. Probing the cured cells with OC43-specific 32P-cDNA showed that cured cells contained no detectable viral RNA. The relative ease of establishment and cure of these persistent infectious makes them attractive as models to study coronavirus regulatory processes.",1
"The presence of maternal antibodies protected suckling C57BL/6 mice from the clinical manifestations of the acute encephalomyelitis caused by mouse hepatitis virus, strain JHM (MHV-JHM), a coronavirus, even though histological evidence of encephalomyelitis was found at early times after inoculation. 100% of infected suckling mice developed a fatal disease in the absence of maternal antibody. By 14 days after inoculation, the brains of all antibody-protected mice examined were nearly normal on histological examination. At 3–8 weeks post-inoculation, approximately 40% of the antibody-protected mice developed a neurological disease characterized by hindlimb paralysis and wasting. Evidence of inflammation and demyelination was apparent in the spinal cord and brainstem. The mice that remained asymptomatic at this time showed few signs of inflammation and none developed clinical disease over the following 9 months. Viral antigen could be detected in most of the mice examined at all times after inoculation, whether symptomatic or not, and was particularly evident in the animals with hindlimb paralysis. MHV-JHM could be consistently cultured from the mice with hindlimb paralysis. These results show that maternal immune factors can completely protect susceptible mice from the acute, fatal, clinical encephalomyelitis caused by MHV-JHM, but cannot prevent the establishment of a latent state and subsequent development of virus-induced, clinically evident, demyelinating disease. This model will be useful for studying the virus and host factors important for the development of MHV-JHM latency and subsequent virus-induced demyelination.",1
"The molecular basis for demyelination induced by the neurotropic murine coronavirus JHM (JHMV or MHV4) is unknown. We have attempted to explore this issue by using neutralizing monoclonal antibodies specific for the major JHMV glycoprotein (E2) to select sets of neutralization resistant (NR) antigenic variant viruses. Monoclonal antibodies J.7.2 and J.2.2 bind to topographically distinct sites on E2. NR variants selected with J.7.2, like parental JHMV, predominantly cause a fatal encephalitis when given intracerebrally to mice, while J.2.2-selected NR variants cause a subacute disease characterized by paralysis and severe demyelination. We report here that consecutive selection with both J.2.2 and J.7.2 monoclonal antibodies results in NR variants which are markedly attenuated in both encephalitic potential and ability to induce demyelination. Analysis of the different variants suggests that the subregion of E2 bound by monoclonal antibody J.7.2 may be a critical viral determinant of paralysis and demyelination in this model system.",1
"Mouse hepatitis virus, strain JHM (MHV-JHM), causes a late onset, clinically apparent, demyelinating encephalomyelitis in 40% of suckling C57BL/6 mice born to immunized dams. Suckling mice born to unimmunized dams rapidly succumb to an acute encephalomyelitis. MHV-JHM can be isolated from the brains and spinal cords of maternal antibody-protected mice when the late onset disease becomes clinically apparent, showing that the virus must be present in these mice when they are still asymptomatic. To determine which cells of the central nervous system (CNS) were potential reservoirs for the virus during the asymptomatic period, tissue sections were assayed simultaneously by immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescence staining for the presence of viral antigen and for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker for astrocytes.2 The results indicate that 20% (range 0–52%) of the MHV-JHM infected cells in asymptomatic mice were astrocytes. In mice symptomatic with late onset hindlimb paralysis, a higher percentage of infected cells were astrocytes. These results indicate that astrocytes are a target cell in both symptomatic and asymptomatic mice persistently infected with MHV-JHM, and suggest that the astrocyte is a potential cellular reservoir for MHV-JHM in asymptomatic mice.",1
"MHV-A59 causes a chronic demyelinating disease in mice which is accompanied by persistence of viral genome in white matter. As part of the investigation into the mechanism of viral persistence, infection of glial cells, probable targets for chronic infection, was studied by the use of mixed glial, enriched oligodendrocyte and enriched astrocyte cultures. Following MHV-A59 infection in vitro, approximately 10% of oligodendrocytes and 30% of astrocytes expressed viral antigens in the absence of overt cytopathic effect. All cultures released infectious virus for the lifetime of the cultures, for at least 45 days in the case of mixed glial cultures. Cultures derived from previously infected mice were similar to those infected in vitro with respect to percentage of cells expressing viral antigen and levels of infectious virus produced. These results show (1) that glial cells are early sites of infection in vivo as well as sites of infection in in vitro cultures, and (2) that glial cells support a non-lytic but productive infection in vitro and thus may contribute to viral persistence in vivo.",1
"Wistar Lewis (WL), Long Evans (LE) and other rat strains develop complete resistance to CNS disease when inoculated intracerebrally with murine hepatitis JHM virus (JHMV) after the 10th day of age. 1 1 Sorensen O, Percy D, Dales S. In vivo and in vitro models of demyelinating diseases. III. JHM virus infection of rats. Arch Neurol 1980; 37: 478-84. Two types of studies were conducted to ascertain the involvement of the cellular immune system in development of resistance. Immunosuppression of WL rats with cyclosporin A (CsA) following onset of the age-related resistance demonstrated that this drug was partially able to abrogate resistance. In the other studies nude (rnu/rnu) rats, their heterozygous (rnu/+) litter mates and genetically related LE rats of various ages were challenged with JHMV. The rnu/+ and LE animals became completely resistant before the age of weaning, whereas some rnu/rnu rats, challenged as late as 70 days of age, showed disease symptoms—albeit after a long latent period. These observations indicated that the cellular immune system plays an important role in suppressing the disease process in the CNS. When the infection of nude rats was initiated on or after the 15th day of life, the histological lesions were generally small and present in both grey and white matter but were seldom seen in the spinal cord. Mononuclear infiltrates were evident throughout the CNS. In some nude rats there was massive mononuclear cell infiltration towards the meningies and into ventricular spaces. By contrast in rnu/+, LE and WL rats with late-onset disease symptoms, demyelinating-type lesions were confined to the white matter and only minor infiltration of mononuclear cells was evident. JHMV RNA was detectable by dot-blotting analysis in the CNS of both paralysed and asymptomatic rnu/rnu and rnu/+ rats, but less RNA was usually detected in heterozygous animals. In-situ hybridization with cDNA probes for JHMV RNA showed that neurons in the hippocampus and cerebellum, as well as cells in the white matter, were frequently infected. The present data indicate that in the rat T cells have an important function in maintaining resistance to the JHMV related disease process. However, even without a functional T cell compartment nude rats challenged after 15 days of age did not develop an acute encephalitis, suggesting that an age-dependent, non-immunological mechanism is also involved in restricting the spread of infection. It is possible that resistance in euthymic rats sets in because: (1) at the time of weaning the CNS matures, so that the number of targets available for infection is reduced, (2) T cells prevent the late-onset disease by clearing persistent, low grade infections from the CNS.",1
"Predominant enterobacteria from infants with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) were examined for an unusual ability to ferment lactose. One such isolate, a Klebsiella pneumoniae strain, was partially induced for lactose operon expression in tryptone containing media, and was also pathogenic in a rabbit ileal loop model for NEC. A spontaneous segregant of this strain was no longer partially induced for lactose operon expression, and was no longer pathogenic in the rabbit model. The gene responsible for this phenotype was cloned. The resulting plasmid was shown to cause both partially induced lactose operon expression and pathogenicity when introduced into a laboratory K. pneumoniae strain. A K. pneumoniae mutant deficient in lactose repressor synthesis was also pathogenic in the rabbit model. These results and previous studies on the intraluminal biochemistry of infants with NEC support the hypothesis that an increased ability for lactose fermentation may be a bacterial pathogenic trait with respect to NEC.",1
"In the present study we investigated age related effects of inoculum size and cellular immunity on the CNS disease caused by JHM virus (JHMV) in Wistar Lewis (WL) rats. Onset of resistance normally becomes evident by the 10th day when inoculation is made with 106 pfu or less. The resistance could be abrogated in 15 day old animals by increasing the dose two-fold, but with rare exceptions, in 35 day old rats an 80-fold increase in pfu fails to surmount resistance. However, treatment with the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A (CsA) abolished resistance, whereby rats challenged at 35 days of age were susceptible to JHMV. The histopathological evidence and disease symptoms in the CsA treated group resembled closely those observed in our previous study with athymic, nude rats. Microscopic examination of the CNS from untreated, infected rats revealed extensive inflammatory responses characterized by perivascular cuffing and mononuclear infiltrates into the neuropile. The parallel CsA treated group showed that inflammatory responses of this type in the CNS were either minimal or absent. From the present evidence, we conclude that JHMV infection, which involves both neuronal and oligodendrocytic elements, is kept in check by the cellular immune system. When cellular immunity is suppressed or absent the disease process is altered from one in which white matter demyelination predominates to another form of disease in which neuronal involvement is prominent.",1
"Prior infection of mice with a field strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) increased the early resistance of euthymic mice to virulent Salmonella typhimurium strain SR-11 infections (as defined by significantly fewer salmonella colony-forming units (cfu) present in spleens and livers 4 days after salmonella infection). This increase in salmonella resistance was observed when the interval between MHV and salmonella infections was 6 days, but not at 3, 10, or 14 day intervals. The mouse lty locus, which controls the number of intracellular salmonella, had a significant effect on the ability of MHV to induce resistance to salmonella. MHV caused an increase in resistance to salmonella in lty s (salmonella susceptible) mice at all doses of salmonella tested (100 to 10000 cfu). In the lty r (salmonella resistant) mice tested the beneficial effect of MHV on salmonella resistance was small and when observed, was only present at salmonella doses of 10000 cfu or greater. Neither the Lps d nor Xid mutations affected the ability of MHV to increase resistance to salmonella infection. In contrast to euthymic mice, MHV infection greatly decreased the resistance of athymic (nude) mice to salmonella infection. Since the Nu locus does not affect the resistance of mice to salmonella (at 4 days post salmonella infection), these results indicate that MHV infection and the nude phenotype interact to increase susceptibility to salmonella. These findings re-emphasize the importance of keeping laboratory mice used in research free of MHV and other immunomodulatory pathogens.",1
"Canine distemper virus (CDV) causes an encephalomyelitis in dogs which varies with the viral strain. The CDV Cornell A75-17 strain produces a delayed, subacute to chronic, demyelinating CNS disease. In contrast, the Snyder Hill (CDV-SH) strain-associated neurological disease is more acute in onset, is usually non-demyelinating and primarily produces lesions in the gray matter. In these studies we describe the effects of these two virulent and one avirulent CDV strain, Rockborn (CDV-RO), on astrocytes in dissociated canine brain cell cultures. In multiple replicate experiments, astrocytes were infected most rapidly by CDV-RO [100% of astrocytes were infected by 14 days post-inoculation (pi.)]. This strain caused severe cytopathic effect (CPE) and cytolysis. CDV-SH similarly produced a rapid infection of the astrocytes. In contrast, CDV A75-17 infected less than 25% of the astrocyte population during the first 28 days p.i. (± 7 days); after 28 days p.i., a rapid rise in astrocyte infection occurred. Both virulent viruses caused astrocytic syncytial formation but did not cause cytolysis of the astrocyte population as was observed with the attenuated virus. Titers of infectious virus, released into the supernatant fluid, reflected the degree of astrocyte infection. Virus released by the cultures late in CDV A75-17 infection showed enhanced ability to infect newly derived astrocytes; in contrast, brain cell passaged CDV-SH did not show increased growth in these cells. These results show that (1) there is a difference in growth rate, CPE and capacity for adaptation of three different CDV strains in astrocytes in vitro, and (2) some aspects of the disease (such as persistence in white matter) produced by the virulent strains in vivo may be related to the course of astrocyte infection observed in vitro.",1
"Mice infected with the JHM strain mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) develop a fatal encephalomyelitis with evidence of demyelination. It has previously been shown that the adoptive transfer of 5 × 107 nylon wool adherent (NWA) spleen cells from immunized donors to lethally infected recipients clears virus from the central nervous system (CNS) and prevents demyelination. Adoptive transfer of a smaller number (1 × 107) of NWA spleen cells from immunized donors also protects from death but does not significantly alter virus replication in the CNS during the acute phase of the infection. Moreover, these mice develop a transient non-fatal encephalomyelitis which occurs approximately 3 weeks post-infection. This delayed encephalomyelitis is associated with a mononuclear cell infiltration into the CNS but little or no evidence of virus replication or increased viral antigen. A virus-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response precedes this delayed onset of disease by 24 to 48 h. Resolution of disease correlates with a selective and permanent suppression of the JHMV-specific DTH reactivity. In addition, no virus-specific DTH is detected following adoptive transfer of viral-specific DTH effectors derived from immunized donors. In contrast, these mice respond to a heterologous antigen, KLH, suggesting that the resolution of the encephalitis is accompanied by a profound suppression in viral-specific DTH response.",1
"Intracerebral infection of C57BL/10SNJ mice with Theiler's virus results in acute encephalitis with subsequent virus clearance and absence of spinal cord demyelination. In contrast, infection of SJL/J mice results in acute encephalitis, virus persistence, and immune-mediated demyelination. These experiments examined the role of T-cell subsets in the in vivo immune response to Theiler's virus in resistant C57BL/10SNJ mice. Depletion of T-cell subsets with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed at CD3 (pan-T-cell marker), CD4+ (class II-restricted) or CD8+ (class I-restricted) T cells resulted in increased frequency of paralysis and death as a result of acute encephalitis. Neuropathologic studies 10 days after infection demonstrated prominent necrosis, primarily in the pyramidal layer of hippocampus and in the thalamus of mice depleted of T-cell subsets. In immunosuppressed and infected C57BL/10SNJ mice, analysis of spinal cord sections 35 days after infection demonstrated small demyelinated lesions relatively devoid of inflammatory cells even though virus antigen could be detected by immunocytochemistry. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are important in the resistance to infection with Theiler's virus in C57BL/10SNJ mice. However, subsequent spinal cord demyelination, to the extent observed in susceptible mice, depends on the presence of virus antigen persistence and a competent cellular immune response.",1
"Infection of mixed glial cell cultures with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-A59 results in an approximately six-fold increase in the level of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I mRNA. In situ hybridization of glial cell cultures infected with MHV-A59 again showed enhanced MHC mRNA expression, both in infected and uninfected cells. These results extend our earlier finding that MHC surface antigens are enhanced on astrocytes and oligodendrocytes after MHV-A59 infection and suggest that this enhancement is a result of an increase in the steady-state level of MHC mRNA. We further demonstrate that increases in MHC mRNA occur in the murine central nervous system (CNS) following infection in vivo. Northern blot analysis of RNA from the brains of infected animals showed transient expression of both MHC class I and class II mRNA over the first 14 days of infection. Expression coincided with viral replication and clearance. In situ hybridization of brain sections from infected animals showed that class I and class II expression was widespread throughout all portions of the brain and in uninfected as well as infected cells. Viral RNA, in contrast, was observed in small foci of cells and mostly within the limbic system. Thus enhancement of MHC mRNA was not restricted either to areas of infection or inflammation. The spatial relationship between viral and MHC expression supports our hypothesis that a soluble mediator is involved in the mechanism of the increase in MHC levels. The fact that MHC induction occurs in vivo as well as in vitro suggests MHC may be important in the mechanism of MHV-induced disease.",1
"The basis of the resistance of SJL/J mice to various strains of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) has been the subject of some debate, especially as it relates to the number and nature of the determinants involved. Our previous work demonstrated that resistance by primary SJL/J glial cultures may involve events subsequent to viral gene expression, possibly due to a defect in cell-to-cell spread of the infection. Since S, the virion's major spike glycoprotein, is known to facilitate the spread of infection due to its syncytiogenic properties, we decided to investigate the role of this viral structural protein in resistance by primary SJL/J glial cells. Variants possessing deletions within the S coding region were able to grow in SJL/J glial cells 10–100 times easier and fuse five-times more efficiently than wt virus. Induction of neurologic disease in SJL/J mice following intracranial inoculation with either wt JHMV or the S deletion variant, AT11f cord, was age-dependent, occurring only in animals inoculated under 4 weeks of age. Resistance in older animals to wt and variant viruses could be abrogated by immunosuppression with cyclosporin A. However, both disease incidence and viral brain titers were higher in animals receiving the JHM variant AT11f cord virus, suggesting that SJL/J resistance to neurologic disease may manifest itself through interactions between inefficient cell-to-cell spread of the infection and protective aspects of the immune response.",1
"To examine the genetic control of acute and late disease induced by a murine coronavirus, strain JHM (JHMV), BALB/cHeA, STS/A, F1 hybrids and 13 recombinant inbred (RI) strains between BALB/cHeA and STS/A mouse strains were inoculated intracerebrally with 100 pfu of JHMV. All the BALB/cHeA mice died within 2 weeks from acute encephalitis. In contrast, STS/A mice were shown to be partially resistant, with a mortality rate of 30%, longer survival times and lower rates of viral production. The mortality rates, survival times and viral titers of F1 hybrids and the RI strains varied, suggesting involvement of multiple genes. STS/A, F1 hybrid and RI mice surviving the acute infection occasionally developed severe paraparesis about 1 month post-infection. In these mice, vacuolar degeneration, astrocytosis, the absence of perivascular cuffing and minimal demyelination were found in the central nervous system. No infectious virus could be recovered from these mice. Although the paralysis of delayed onset was limited to STS/A, F1 hybrid and eight of the 13 RI strains, the incidence varied significantly among the RI strains. These results may suggest that JHMV-induced late disease is also under multifactorial control. The pathogenesis of JHMV infection is discussed.",1
"Previous investigations have revealed that in vivo use of diethylcarbamazine (N,N-diethyl-4-methyl-1-piperazine carboxamide; DEC), the mainstay of prevention and therapy for filariases, results in increased titers of antibody to feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA) in feline leukemia virus (FeLV)-infected cats.In the present study, the effect of in vitro DEC on detection of serum antibodies to retroviruses was investigated. The addition of DEC (5 mg ml−1, pH 7·3–7·4) to the serum diluent resulted in detection of antibody to FOCMA by indirect membrane immunofluorescence in five of five FeLV-infected cats, whereas samples from all five cats tested negative without the addition of DEC. In vitro DEC also increased the absorbance values generated by enzyme immunoassay human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) antibody testing of samples from (a) persons with AIDS-related disease; (b) persons with helper T-lymphocytes < 500 mm−3 blood; and (c) persons testing positive for antibody to HIV-1 env- but not gag-related antigens as determined by radioimmunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( RIP-SDS PAGE ). We conclude that in vitro as well as in vivo use of DEC may alter results of antibody testing for retroviruses.",1
"The role of viruses and bacteria in the development of respiratory tract infections causing acute deteriorations in lung function in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) was investigated. Over a period of 30 months, 29 viral respiratory diseases were proven serologically by testing 275 sporadically collected sera from 75 patients with cystic fibrosis. The influenza A virus was the most frequent responsible viral pathogen (11 × ), followed by adenovirus (8 × ), influenza B virus (5 × ), parainfluenza virus type 3 (3 × ), parainfluenza virus type 1 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (each of 1 × ). There was no serological evidence for infections with parainfluenza virus type 2, Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Coxiella burnetii. Deterioration of the clinical condition was found in 78% of the viral infections leading in 70% to hospital admission. Patients with cystic fibrosis and viral respiratory illnesses showed significantly more admissions to the hospital (3·2 ± 2·7) with a longer stay (90·6 ± 99·6 days). Nearly all viral episodes (93%) were accompanied or followed by a significant change of the microbial flora in the sputum especially by colonisation with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae. Seventy-two per cent of the viral infections occurred at home and 28% seemed to be hospital acquired. Our study emphasises the importance of improving antibacterial therapy at home to reduce the number of hospital admissions. Efforts for prophylaxis by vaccination or the use of chemotherapeutic agents should be made for the patients with cystic fibrosis.",1
"Seventy-two human and 72 bovine faecal specimens were tested for rotavirus by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), four commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Rotascreen, Wellcozyme, Rotazyme II and IDEIA) and two latex agglutination (LA) kits (RotaScreen and Wellcome). Specimens which were negative by PAGE but positive by one or more of the kits were further examined by direct and immuno-electron microscopy (DEM and IEM). If also negative by DEM and IEM the kit result was considered to be a false positive. Three kits (RotaScreen and IDEIA ELISAs and RotaScreen LA) had specificity and sensitivity greater than 90% on the human specimens but only two (RotaScreen ELISA and LA) had specificity and sensitivity over 80% on the bovine specimens. These kits can therefore be used with reasonable confidence for rotavirus diagnosis, but none of them has any advantage over PAGE other tha speed.",1
"An adenovirus (AV) group-specific latex agglutination test (LA) was assessed for its ability to detect AVs in faeces and to confirm the isolation of AVs in cell culture. It detected all of 62 strains belonging to subgenus F (AdF) but only 4 40 non-AdF serotypes. This is possibly due to the concentration of AdF strains in faeces being greater than non-AdF strains. No false positive reactions were found with 55 AV-negative faeces, 42 of which contained other viruses frequently found in faeces. Only one of the 157 specimens examined gave a non-specific reaction, i.e. test and control latexes both agglutinated. All of 14 AV isolates but none of the 12 isolates of other viruses were LA positive. It is concluded that LA would be useful for detecting AdF strain in faeces and for confirmation of AV isolates, especially if electron microscopic facilities were not available.",1
"A consensus sequence for the human long interspersed repeated DNA element, L1H8 (LINE or KpnI sequence), is presented. The sequence contains two open reading frames (ORFs) which are homologous to ORFs in corresponding regions of L1 elements in other species. The L1H8 ORFs are separated by a small evolutionarily nonconserved region. The 5′ end of the consensus contains frequent terminators in all three reading frames and has a relatively high GC content with numerous stretches of weak homology with AluI repeats. The 5′ ORF extends for a minimum of 723 bp (241 codons). The 3′ ORF is 3843 bp (1281 codons) and predicts a protein of 149 kD which has regions of weak homology to the polymerase domain of various reverse transcriptases. The 3′ end of the consensus has a 208-bp nonconserved region followed by an adenine-rich end. The organization of the L1H8 consensus sequence resembles the structure of eukaryotic mRNAs except for the noncoding region between ORFs. However, due to base substitutions or truncation most elements appear incapable of producing mRNA that can be translated. Our observation that individual elements cluster into subfamilies on the basis of the presence or absence of blocks of sequence, or by the linkage of alternative bases at multiple positions, suggests that most L1 sequences were derived from a small number of structural genes. An estimate of the mammalian L1 substitution rate was derived and used to predict the age of individual human elements. From this it follows that the majority of human L1 sequences have been generated within the last 30 million years. The human elements studied here differ from each other, yet overall the L1H8 sequences demonstrate a pattern of species-specificity when compared to the L1 families of other mammals. Possible mechanisms that may account for the origin and evolution of the L1 family are discussed. These include pseudogene formation (retroposition), transposition, gene conversion, and RNA recombination.",1
"cDNA, synthesized on bovine coronavirus (BCV) genomic RNA templates, could be used to detect very small quantities (i.e. 1 pg) of viral RNA by hybridization with either radioisotopic-labelled or biotinylated recombinant plasmids. Virus was optimally attached to nitrocellulose membranes when spotted in 1 × SSC, whereas 20 × SSC was superior for viral RNA. Denaturation and RNA fixation of both RNA, still encapsidated in virus particles and isolated genomic RNA, was achieved by baking of the blots in vacuum. Virus detection in the supernatant of infected HRT-18 cells was feasible, but improved significantly after proteinase K treatment. No homology was observed between virus cDNA with either plasmid DNA or nucleic acid isolated from non-infected HRT-18 cells. Hybridization with radioisotopic-labelled probes in higher formamide concentrations (up to 60%) increased the detection signals, possibly by reducing reassociation of the probe. Significant detection amplification (30–50 times) was achieved in the case of biotinylated probes by stimulation of hyperpolymer formation on already hybridized target sequences, by additional hybridization with biotinylated pUC-19. A detection amplification was also obtained when hybridization was done with two probes (pBC-52 and pBC-247), containing non-overlapping viral sequences. Although the detectability was surpassed by biotinylated probes, sensitivity was superior in radioisotopic virus detection.",1
"Molecular hybridization, previously optimized for purified bovine coronavirus (BCV), was adapted for detection of virus in clinical specimens. For this purpose, the accuracy of the existing tests had to be improved and suitable means for removal of extraneous molecules had to be established. Six radioactive probes were used to obtain adequate detection signals. These probes, containing the complete N and E1 gene sequences and other sequences, hybridized to about 1 4 of the total length of the viral RNA. Genomic RNA could be detected after direct spotting of samples, but prior Freo-nextraction or centrifugation of specimens on a cushion of sucrose improved considerably the positive identification of virus containing samples. RNA detection in positive clinical specimens was significantly better by hybridization than immunological detection of BCV by ELISA, although differences were slight after two passages of the virus on HRT-18 cell monolayers. Consequently, the reliability of positive and negative test results in hybridization tests on Freon extracted specimens was better than in ELISA. However, results after extraction with other organic solvents were inferior. The accuracy of ELISA was surpassed by hybridization assays. Background signals, due to vector homology were found to be negligible in all the samples analyzed.",1
"Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against herpes simplex virus (HSV)-coded glycoproteins gB, gC, gD and gE were employed in an in vitro model of neuroinvasiveness using sensory neurons from rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells. The neurons were cultured in a two-chamber system allowing infection via the neuritic extensions exclusively. The effects of 30 MAbs on viral replication of the encephalitis-derived HSV-1 strain 2762 and its less neuroinvasive variant 2762p11 were assayed in this model. One MAb reactive with gD gave a nine-fold reduction of the virus yields of both strains. One MAb directed against gB gave an enhanced virus yield of strain 2762, but not of the 2762p11 variant. Another gB-reactive MAb decreased the virus yield of strain 2762p11, but not of 2762 after neuritic infection. The findings indicate that an alteration of gB has occurred during the passage of the strain 2762. Mutants of the same strain were derived by infecting hybridomas producing MAb reactive with gB, gC, gD and gE, respectively. The gB hybridoma mutant showed a significantly lower neuroinvasiveness in the DRG model, and was non-virulent after snout infection of mice. We suggest that the structure of gB of the strain 2762 is of importance for the neuroinvasiveness of this strain.",1
"A temperature-sensitive mutant of vesicular stomatitis virus was inoculated intranasally into infant Sprague Dawley rats aged 9 to 17 days. Rats receiving the virus at 9 days of age had an extensive spread of infection throughout the brain and the animals died after a few days. Rats inoculated at day 11 postnatally survived and the infection was limited to the olfactory pathways, hypothalamus, diagonal bands and the anterior raphe nuclei. Stereological measurements showed that the volume of infected neurons constituted 67 ± 10% of the total neuronal volume in the dorsal raphe nucleus. Double-labelling experiments revealed that both 5-hydroxytryptamine- and substance P-immunoreactive neurons contained the virus antigen. The motor stimulant effect of amphetamine was studied at 3 months post infection. The increase in amphetamine-induced frequency and duration of rearing was significantly attenuated in infected rats and the amphetamine-induced locomotion was slightly reduced.",1
"There is evidence supporting spinal cord nitric oxide (NO) production in the mechanisms underlying hyperalgesia, presumed to arise from the activity of neuronal nitric oxide synthase type I (NOS I). Intrathecal administration of interleukin-1β and interferon-γ to rats results in a thermal hyperalgesia which peaks at 2 h post-injection but which is undetectable 8 h post-injection. Expression of mRNA for nitric oxide synthase type II (NOS II) was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction followed by Southern hybridization utilizing specific oligonucleotides in spinal cord tissue from animals 4 h and 8 h after cytokine injection, but not at longer time points. NOS II protein was detected in soluble fractions of spinal cords from animals 4 h and 8 h after cytokine injection. In situ hybridization for NOS II mRNA revealed positive cells bilaterally in the spinal cord 4 h after cytokine injection in a perivascular distribution and scattered throughout the gray and white matter. Immunohistochemistry for NOS II showed a similar distribution which could only be partially accounted for by macrophages/microglia. These results provide evidence for induction of NOS II expression under conditions producing thermal hyperalgesia and suggest a possible role in this behavior for the production of NO by a variety of cell types in the CNS.",1
"3,3′-Iminodipropionitrile (IDPN) has been reported to disrupt learning and memory in rats (24). The present work addressed the effects of IDPN on tasks requiring the use of spatial information. Separate groups of male rats were dosed with IDPN (IP, in 1 ml/kg saline) for 3 consecutive days and tested in the following procedures: (a) step-through passive avoidance conditioning (0, 100, 150, and 200 mg/kg/day); (b) Morris water maze (MWM) acquisition and retention (0, 125, 150, 175, and 200 mg/kg/day); (c) radial arm maze (RAM) acquisition (0, 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg/day); (d) RAM steady-state performance (0, 200, and 400 mg/kg/day); (e) repeated acquisition in the RAM (0, and 200 mg/kg/day). The vestibular toxicity of IDPN resulted in alterations in spontaneous behavior or swimming deficits in 5 of 8 rats treated with 175 mg/kg/day and in all the animals dosed with 200 or 400 mg/kg/day. IDPN increased step-through PA latencies at 200 mg/kg/day but not at lower doses. In the MWM, no performance deficits were observed at the dose levels preserving the swimming ability of the animals. In both the acquisition and the steady-state RAM tasks, IDPN (400 mg/kg/day) induced an increase in both choice errors and perseverative errors. In the RAM repeated acquisition paradigm, IDPN (200 mg/kg/day) induced performance deficits that included a decreased rate of within-session reduction in errors. The present data show that IDPN disrupts performance of tasks requiring spatial learning and memory and indicate that these deficits can be in part caused by an acquisition deficit.",1
"To study the effect of cell type-restricted hamster PrP expression on susceptibility to the hamster scrapie agent, we generated transgenic mice using a 1 kb hamster cDNA clone containing the 0.76 kb HPrP open reading frame under control of the neuron-specific enolase promoter. In these mice, expression of HPrP was detected only in brain tissue, with highest levels found in neurons of the cerebellu, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebral cortex. These transgenic mice were susceptible to infection by the 263K strain of hamster scrapie with an average incubation period of 93 days, compared to 72 days in normal hamsters. In contrast, nontransgenic mice were not susceptible to this agent. These results indicate that neuron-specific expression of the 1 kb HPrP minigene including the HPrP open-reading frame is sufficient to mediate susceptibility to hamster scraple, and that HPrP expression in nonneuronal brain cells is not necessary to overcome the TSE species barrier.",1
"An intradermal injection of Freund's incomplete adjuvant oil (FIA) without further additives was shown to induce erosive polyarthritis in dark Agouti (DA) rats, but not in Lewis rats. Histological examination revealed joint inflammation, first with polymorphonuclear cells and synovial hyperplasia, and subsequently, with multinucleated giant cells. Both constituents of FIA, mineral oil and Arlacel® A, as well as Pristane oil were arthritogenic, whereas vegetable oils were not. Re-administration of adjuvant oil after recovery failed to induce arthritis, thus making possible a role of specific immunity in this new form of arthritis in rats.",1
"A cross-sectional study was carried out in a dairy goat herd, investigating the presence of rotavirus by means of ELISA, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and two latex agglutination tests in feces of 63 goat kids younger than 1 month, with and without diarrhea, and in feces of 19 adult goats during the first few days after parturition. All animals belonged to a herd located in the mountains of the León province (NW Spain). Rotaviruses were found in 18 out of 63 goat kid fecal samples but no significant association between shedding of rotavirus and presence of diarrhea could be established. Rotaviruses were found in kids aged 6 to 21 days, and more frequently between 6 and 10 days. No shedding of virus was detected in any of the adults. Considering ELISA as the reference test, PAGE and both latex agglutination tests were less sensitive. One of the latex tests was also highly non-specific. All PAGE-positive samples showed the typical electropherotype of group A rotavirus. Feces were also screened for other pathogens including Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens and Cryptosporidium parvum. C. parvum oocysts were detected in the feces of six out of 45 goat kids tested, all six suffering from diarrhea. This paper represents the first description of rotavirus infections in goats in Spain. The possible mechanisms of viral diffusion within the herd and its role as pathogen in goats are discussed.",1
"Porcine blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were shown to produce interferon-α (IFNα) following incubation with cells infected by a coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) with specificities for leukocyte subsets and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens were used to characterize IFNα producer cells. The production of IFNα was found to be a function of non-phagocytic, non-adherent, non-T, non-B, CD4+ (and to a lesser extent CD8+) MHC-class-II-positive cells. Furthermore, addition of anti-MHC (class II) mAb during PBMC incubation with virus-infected cells reduced IFN yields, suggesting that masking of these surface antigens alters PBMC responsiveness to IFN induction.",1
Experimental and clinical evidence is presented which supports the hypothesis that CD8+ T lymphocytes aimed at suppressing HIV replication in infected CD4+ T cells may have an important role in the pathogenesis of AIDS by directly causing a decrease in CD4+ T lymphocyte numbers. Possible models to test this hypothesis are discussed.,1
"Summary Porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which secrete IFNα in response to a coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, were detected by a filter immunoplaque assay (ELISPOT). IFNα-producing cells (IPC), which are present at a low frequency in the blood, could be enriched up to 100-fold by sequential depletion of plastic-adherent cells and cell fractionation on metrizamide density gradients. IPC were present in the non-adherent low-density cell subpopulation. Cell selection experiments using antibody (Ab)-coated immunomagnetic beads revealed that porcine IPC could be positively selected by anti-CD4 or -SLA-class-II Ab, but not by anti-CD2 or -CD8 Ab. The estimated IFN yield per IPC was found to increase when IPC were assayed at higher concentrations. These data suggest that IPC represent a unique and distinct cell population in the blood, which could secrete higher amounts of IFN following its accumulation at a site of viral infection.",1
"Translational errors are necessary so as to allow gene expression in various organisms. In retroviruses, synthesis of pol gene products necessitates either readthrough of a stop codon or frameshifting. Here we present an experimental system that permits quantification of translational errors in vivo. It consists of a family of expression vectors carrying different mutated versions of the luc gene as reporter. Mutations include both an in-frame stop codon and 1-base-pair deletions that require readthough or frameshift, respectively, to give rise to an active product. This system is sensitive enough to detect background errors in mammalian cells. In addition, one of the vectors contains two unique cloning sites that make it possible to insert any sequence of interest. This latter vector was used to analyse the effect of a DNA fragment, proposed to be the target of high level slippage at the gag-pol junction of HIV. The effect of paromomycin and kasugamycin, two antibiotics known to influence translational ambiguity, was also tested in cultured cells. The results indicate that paromomycin diversely affects readthrough and frameshifting, while kasugamycin had no effect. This family of vectors can be used to analyse the influence of structural and external factors on translational ambiguity in both mammalian cells and bacteria.",1
"Clones from the bovine enteric coronavirus (F15) cDNA library were cloned in pBR322 and sequenced by the method of Sanger and Coulson. This led to the identification of a sequence of 1,300 bases which contained a single open reading frame of 690 bases yielding a protein having properties of the matrix protein (M). It was comprised of 230 amino acids with a molecular weight of 26,376 Da. It was hydrophobic and had a net charge of +8 at neutral pH. Analysis of its secondary structure could not establish a simple transmembrane arrangement of the amino acids. Comparison of its nucleotide sequence with that of BECV Mebus strain showed only a two-base change resulting in a 100% homology between the two amino acid sequences. Furthermore, a very conserved structure of M appeared on comparison with the Dayoff optimal alignment of MHV-A59, MHV-JHM, TGEV, IBV Beaudette and IBV 6/82M amino acid sequences. As the two strains of BECV, F15 and Mebus present some antigenic differences, this led us to reconsider the role of M in viral antigen specificity. A hypothesis is that, as it seems to possess the necessary information on its transmembrane region, it is an ideal candidate for the viral budding process.",1
"The administration of a hypercholesterolaemic (HC) diet rendered genetically resistant A/J mice susceptible to mouse hepatitis 3 (MHV3) infection. The animals died cf acute hepatitis with high viral titres in the liver accompanied by many necrotic foci and high serum transaminase levels. Resistance to virus was re-established by refeeding HC mice with a normal diet for 2 weeks. This of modification by pathogenesis was accompanied by an increase in the susceptibility of hepatocyte cultures from HC mice to MHV3 and could be explained by an enhancement in virus adsorption. We hypothesize that the incorporation of cholesterol into the plasma membranes of hepatocytes of HC mice, thereby decreasing the membrane fluidity, may lead to an increase in the availability of virus receptors.",1
"Les bronchiolites à VRS sont fréquentes, épidémiques et nécessitent parfois l'hospitalisation des nourrissons, voire une réanimation. Le déterminisme des lésions pulmonaires est complexe, lié au virus et à la réaction immunitaire. Le traitement est symptomatique, et l'utilisation de la ribavirine est limitée aux formes sévères. Le diagnostic virologique doit être rapide, et la recherche immunologique directe des protéines virales est la technique la plus utilisée",1
"Macrolides have enjoyed continued use for over 40 years, being increasingly usedfor the treatment of respiratory tract infections. Newer macrolides have been introduced that show improved absorption after oral administration, better gastrointestinal tolerance, and delivery of increased amounts of drug to the infection site. Macrolides are commonly used in community-acquired pneumonia, as well as in atypical pneumonia and legionellosis. The newer macrolides, in comparative studies, have been shown to be as effective as the conventional therapies for treating acute otitis media, acute sinusitis and acute pharyngitis, with a low incidence of side-effects. However, dosing can be simplified because of their unique pharmacokinetic properties. Limitations in the use of macrolides for respiratory infections include rather marginal activity in the most severe cases of Haemophilus influenzae infections, lack of activity against Klebsiella and other coliforms, which precludes their use as single agents in the therapy of pneumonia in patients with significant underlying disease or in the elderly, and development of resistance in streptococci and staphylococci.",1
Biological response modifiers (BRMs) are agents which can modify the immune response to cancer or invasion of the organism by infectious agents. An explosive appearance of new BRMs has resulted from the development of recombinant gene technology and the availability of monoclonal antibodies. Colony-stimulating factors first became available for the prevention of neutropenia but may also have a role in the treatment of infections. Interleukin-1 is being tested as a modular of hematopoiesis and may be useful as a helper factor for T- and B-cell function. Immunoglobulins are being used against viral and bacterial infections while interferons can prevent viral upper respiratory infections and suppress or irradicate some viral hepatitides. Other BRMs which show promise include chemical agents and traditional herbal medicines.,1
"In vitro interferon production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 50 children suffering from recurrent upper respiratory tract infections was examined, and compared with that of 50 healthy children. Five respiratory pathogenic viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were used as inducers. Cells from every child responded to at least three out of the six inducers by interferon production. As a group, cultures prepared from patient cells showed decreased production of IFN when stimulated with adeno, rhino, corona or RS viruses or with the mycoplasma. Similar trend between the two groups of children was seen as regards influenza A virus induced IFN production in leukocyte cultures. These results corroborate our previous findings that relative deficiency in interferon production appears to be inducer-specific, and suggest that this phenomenon may have a role in the pathogenesis of recurrent respiratory infections.",1
"Background: Detection of respiratory viruses by time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay based on monoclonal antibodies were developed in our laboratories in the late 1980s and they have been successfully used in daily diagnosis for more than seven years. Later, similar Biotin-EIAs were developed but the sensitivities were unsatisfactory. Objectives: Further optimization of monoclonal Biotin-EIAs and comparison of the optimized assays with TR-FIAs. Study design: Variations in test format, diluents, incubation times and temperatures, and different monoclonal antibodies were tested, and the final comparisons were made with TR-FIA using stored nasopharyngeal aspirates. Results: The improvements in Biotin-EIA featured four changes which increased sensitivity in the assay: (a) test diluent contained diethylenetriamino-pentaacetic acid; (b) antigen and biotinylated detector antibody were added simultaneously; (c) reaction time was extended from 1 h at 37°C to overnight at 4°C; (d) from the thirteen monoclonal antibodies used in TR-FIA, ten were optimal also in Biotin-EIA, but in the parainfluenza 1 and 2 assays other monoclonals proved more sensitive. Out of 257 originally positive specimens tested in the comparison studies, 192 (74.7%) were again positive and 54 (21.0%) were negative in both assays; nine were negative in TR-FIA but positive in Biotin-EIA, while two specimens were negative in Biotin-EIA but positive in TR-FIA. The overall agreement between the two assays was 95.7%. Conclusions: All monoclonal Biotin-EIAs can be optimized to the same sensitivity as TR-FIAs for the detection of respiratory viruses. Laboratories which have no TR-FIA expertise may use Biotin-EIA in the diagnosis of acute respiratory infections.",1
"Background: The diagnosis of respiratory infections by detecting viral antigens has received considerable attention using immunofluorescent assays (IFA) and enzyme immunoassays (EIA). Time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TR-FIA) has been developed for several viruses. Objectives: To prepare monoclonal antibodies to coronavirus strains, to incorporate them into a TR-FIA, and test the assay on clinical specimens. Study design: Monoclonal antibodies were prepared to the N nucleoprotein of the two human respiratory coronaviruses, HCV strains 229E and OC43. Monoclonals to both viruses were completely type-specific; they did not cross-react between themselves or with multiple strains of other respiratory viruses. These antibodies were configured into optimized EIA and TR-FIA tests. The all-monoclonal tests were then compared to polyclonal EIA tests in terms of their ability to detect virus in clinical specimens. Results: The all-monoclonal TR-FIA was uniformly the most sensitive, detecting virus in all 13 229E-positive specimens compared to 69% for the monoclonal EIA and 54% for the polyclonal EIA test. Similar results were obtained for 10 OC43-positive specimens: 100% in TR-FIA, 90% in monoclonal EIA, and 80% in polyclonal EIA. For 229E in TR-FIA, mean positive/negative (P/N) ratios were 143 for 229E-positive human embryonic lung fibroblast (HLF) cell culture fluids and 10 for positive nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens; for OC43 in TR-FIA, mean P/N values were 964 for OC43-positive rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cell culture fluids and 174 for positive NPA specimens. The sensitivities of the TR-FIA were determined with purified virions to be 0.308 ng virus per well for HCV-229E and 0.098 ng virus per well for HCV-OC43. Conclusions: This rapid and sensitive test appears to be much more sensitive than traditional antigen detection assays but will require more extensive field testing on clinical specimens.",1
"Hypotheses: (i) Flow cytometry has the potential for rapid detection of respiratory viral antigens. (ii) This technique can be applied to viral diagnosis in clinical samples. Objectives and study design: (i) To study the identification of six common respiratory viral pathogens by flow cytometry, in virus infected and uninfected cultured cells, as models of positive and negative clinical samples. (ii) To compare flow cytometry with the established techniques of viral isolation and immunofluorescent microscopy in the diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus infection in 68 naso-pharyngeal aspirates taken from children and sent to the virology laboratory for routine virological diagnosis. Results: (i) For each virus analysed, populations of infected and non-infected cells were clearly discernable, confirming potential for this method in rapid viral diagnosis in clinical samples. (ii) Two definitions were employed for a sample to be positive by flow cytometry, these were compared with the combined established techniques. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of flow cytometry were 41%, 98%, 92% and 71% for the first definition and 74%, 88%, 80% and 84% for the second definition respectively. Conclusions: As tested in this study, flow cytometry is less sensitive than established techniques as well as recently developed rapid diagnostic techniques for the diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus infection. Further evaluation of the potential of flow cytometry in rapid viral diagnosis is warranted.",1
"Background: Lowered yields of virus-induced interferon (IFN) by leukocyte cultures were previously suggested to be associated with recurrent respiratory infections in children (Pitkäranta et al. (1993) Clin. Diagn. Virol. 1, 101–108) Objectives: To investigate if the observed lowered IFN producing capacity was secondary to the underlying disease and, consequently, would be normalized after recovery of the child from the chain of infections. Study design: Forty-eight 3–12-year-old children suffering from recurrent upper respiratory tract infections (acute otitis media included) were followed-up for 2 years. Their clinical condition and virus-induced interferon production in cultures of peripheral blood leukocytes were examined at the beginning and end of this period. Results: In 24 children the health improved strikingly during the follow-up, in 12 children a mild improvement took place, while 12 children remained constantly ill. IFN yields in cultures stimulated with corona- and respiratory syncytical viruses improved along with the clinical situation of the children. Parallel cultures induced with adeno-, influenza A or rhinoviruses did not show a similar correlation. Conclusion: These results suggest that the relationship between interferon production by leukocyte cultures and recurrent infections is complex and may be virus-specific.",1
"Background: Advances have been made in selecting sensitive cell lines for isolation, in early detection of respiratory virus growth in cells by rapid culture assays, in production of monoclonal antibodies to improve many tests such as immunofluorescence detection of virus antigens in nasopharyngeal aspirates, in highly sensitive antigen detections by time-resolved fluoroimmunoassays (TR-FIAs) and biotin-enzyme immunoassays (BIOTH-E), and, finally, in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of respiratory virus DNA or RNA in clinical specimens. All of these advances have contributed to new or improved possibilities for the diagnosis of respiratory virus infections. Objectives and study design: This review summarizes our experiences during the last 15 years in the development of diagnostic tests for respiratory virus infections, and in use of these tests in daily diagnostic work and in epidemiological studies. Results: Immunofluorescence tests based on monoclonal antibodies, all-monoclonal TR-FIAs, and biotin-enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) have about the same sensitivities and specificities. They compare well with the sensitivity of virus culture. PCR followed by liquid-phase hybridization is a sensitive method for detecting adenovirus DNA and enterovirus and rhinovirus RNA in clinical specimens. IgG EIA on paired acute and convalescent phase sera is the most sensitive serological test for respiratory virus infections and is a valuable reference method when evaluating the sensitivity of new diagnostic tests. The IgG avidity test can distinguish primary infections from re-infections at least in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. IgM antibody assays, on the other hand, had low sensitivities in our studies. Conclusions: The choice of diagnostic methods for respiratory virus infections depends on the type and location of the laboratory, the number of specimens tested, and the previous experience of the laboratory. Virus culture, whenever possible, should be the basic diagnostic method; the results, including identification of the virus, should be available no more than 24 h later than the results of rapid diagnostic tests. In small laboratories, especially in hospitals where specimen transportation is well organized, immunofluorescence may be the best choice for antigen detection with the provision that an experienced microscopist and a good UV microscope are available. If the laboratory receives a large number of specimens and has previous experience with EIAs, then biotin-EIAs or TR-FIAs may be the most practical techniques. Their advantages include the stability of the antigens in clinical samples since intact, exfoliated epithelial cells are not required, treatment of specimens is practical, testing of large numbers of specimens is possible, and reading the printed test result is less subjective than reading fluorescence microscopy. The larger role of PCR in the diagnosis of respiratory virus infections depends on future developments such as practical methods to extract DNA or RNA and to purify the extracts from nonspecific inhibitors, plus further improvements to minimize cross-contamination. Group-specific detection of enteroviruses and rhinoviruses is an example of the potential for PCR technology. In experienced laboratories. EIA IgG antibody tests should be available. Recombinant antigens may be a useful part of such assays.",1
"Background: Acute infectious diarrhea in young children is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Even in developed countries, infectious enteritis is second only to respiratory infections as a cause of morbidity in early childhood. Objective: To nominate the various viral agents that cause enteritis, discuss the pathogenesis, clinical features, epidemiology and diagnostic procedures employed. Study design: Pertinent literature was reviewed and the findings of investigations carried out on viral enteritis by various colleagues recalled. Results: The viruses causing gastroenteritis include: Rotaviruses; Adenoviruses-especially Ad 31, Ad 40 and Ad 41; members of the Caliciviridae, e.g. Norwalk virus, Hawaii virus, Snow Mountain virus, Taunton virus, Southampton virus, Toronto virus (formerly mini-reovirus) and others; Astrovirus; Coronavirus; Torovirus; Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and possibly Picobirnavirus. Enteritis-producing viruses replicate in columar epithelial cells in the distal parts of villi of the small intestine. Two mechanisms are addressed to explain why diarrhea occurs. Clinically, the main expression of illness is a watery diarrhea that lasts 24 h to about 7 days. Vomiting is of shorter duration and may not always accompany the diarrhea. Fever is generally ⩽ 38.5°C. Virus is shed in the stool for about 3–7 days. Diagnostic procedures employ electron microscopy (EM), immune electron microscopy (IEM), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TR-FIA), latex agglutination, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Conclusion: In developed countries viral enteritis among young children may be up to three times more common than bacterial gut disease. With the exception of CMV enteric involvement, the stool is characteristically not bloody and white blood cells are not found. Patient management may involve the employment of IV replacement therapy to counter dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Milder cases may be managed with oral rehydration.",1
"Livestock wastes contain many pathogenic microorganisms including bacteria, viruses and protozoa. Following the application of these wastes to land the potential exists for environmental contamination. Plants, soil and ultimately water courses which may subsequently be used as catchments for public water supplies may all be affected. Research attention is now being focused on this possibility, especially in the case of protozoan pathogens which may be the most important as they are often resistant to current methods used in public water treatment. In this review we highlight some of the many factors that are likely to influence the degree of pollution by their effect on both the vertical and horizontal transport of microorganisms through soil. Soil pH, temperature, the presence of plants, microbial surface properties, type of waste, soil type and soil water content and flow may all affect the rate and extent of vertical transport, with the latter two generally considered to be the most important. Lateral movement is a particular problem in soils with impermeable substrata or in waterlogged conditions and in these cases the major factors affecting movement include rainfall rate, topography of the land and the rate at which microorganisms partition into the runoff.",1
"Diarrhoeal diseases are among the most important health problems in the world today. While they are generally mild, nuisance illnesses in the developed world, where clean water and sanitation are adequate, these diseases are the most common cause of death in young children in the developing world, where clean water is not available and sanitation is inadequate. In these areas, up to 25% of children may never reach their fifth birthday. In addition, although the impact on growth and nutritional status is difficult to quantify, the cumulative toll on overall child health is enormous. A wide variety of infectious agents are implicated in the aetiology of acute diarrhoeal illness, many of which were unknown 20 years ago. The epidemiology, pathogenic mechanisms and clinical presentation of the common bacterial and viral pathogens, as they are currently understood, will be discussed in this chapter.",1
"Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIP) is a clinical syndrome characterized by symptoms and signs of intestinal occlusion, in absence of any mechanical obstruction of the gut lumen. It causes impaired transit of intestinal contents and is determined by abnormalities of motor activity. The term CIP is used to indicate a heterogeneous group of disorders with many different pathogenic mechanisms. The defect in the regulation of intestinal transit can be at any level of motility control. Two main types of CIP are recognized, termed respectively myogenic (when smooth muscle cells are affected) and neurogenic (caused by abnormalities of extrinsic and/or intrinsic nervous supplies). Both types may be secondary to a variety of recognizable diseases or idiopathic. In myogenic CIP, intestinal transit is impaired because of lack of propulsive strength; in the neurogenic form, contractions are powerful but not sufficiently co-ordinated to propel intestinal contents aborally in an organized fashion. CIP belongs to the large and loosely defined group of digestive functional disorders. These disorders probably share common pathogenic mechanisms but with different expressiveness. The reasons why only some patients present recurrent symptomatological bouts resembling mechanical occlusion has not been clarified. This aspect is of great clinical relevance and deserves attention, as CIP patients, unlike other patients with severe functional disorders, may undergo repeated, useless and potentially dangerous operations. The diagnosis of CIP may be suggested by clinical features and is based on radiological, endoscopic, manometric, and histological findings. Recent technological improvements facilitate the recognition of this intriguing syndrome. In particular, manometric recording of the small bowel motility, which has long been considered an important research technique, can now also be regarded as a useful diagnostic tool.",1
"Increased knowledge has been gained into the aetiology and pathogenesis of viral gastroenteritis during the past two decades. There are now thought to be four major subclassifications of gastroenteritis-causing viruses; these include rotavirus, enteric adenovirus, calicivirus, including Norwalk and Norwalk-like viruses, and astrovirus. The association of these agents with gastroenteritis has been made by their electron microscopic detection in stool and intestinal biopsy specimens from affected patients, the inability to detect the viruses after recovery from disease, and the subsequent development of immunoglobulin responses after infection; in some instances disease transmission was achieved in human volunteers. The association of these viral agents with gastroenteritis has facilitated the study of classification, epidemiology, immunity, diagnostic tests, methods of treatment and, most importantly, disease prevention strategies such as vaccine development for rotavirus. This chapter highlights the major features of these agents, with special attention being given to the pertinent molecular biology as well as current and future prospects for vaccination. Enteric viral infections of the gastrointestinal tract in patients with AIDS are also discussed.",1
"Recent neuropathological studies of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis have focused attention on the high number of cells in the lesions that show typical morphological features of apoptosis. Surprisingly, it has turned out that the vast majority of apoptotic cells are T lymphocytes and that they actually represent the antigen-specific T-cell population responsible for the induction of the disease. Taken together, these data suggest that clearance of autoimmune inflammation in the nervous system is accomplished by the destruction of the antigen-specific T-cell population within the lesions. This may explain the low level of central nervous system specific T-cell memory formation, as well as previously unexplained phenomena of ‘epitope spreading’, in autoimmune inflammation of the nervous system",1
New examples of high-level ribosomal frameshift and readthrough events have been described over the past year and a half. These include −1 frameshifiting at tandem codons and + 1 frameshifiting at neighboring slow codons. Several bizarre examples of ribosome jumping and multiple stop-codon readthrough continue to perplex investigators in this field.,1
"The recent identification of an endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment has added to the complexity of the structural and functional organization of the early secretory pathway. Protein sorting along the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi pathway depends on different signals and mechanisms, some of which guarantee recycling from various levels of the Golgi apparatus to biosynthetically earlier compartments.",1
The past year has seen significant advances in the field of protein translocation: the roles of the signal recognition particle and its receptor have been understood in greater detail; many membrane components responsible for translocation have been identified; and insight has been gained into how proteins cross membranes.,1
"Recent cloning of genes encoding membrane proteins of the Golgi complex has allowed investigation of protein targeting to this organelle. Targeting signals have been identified in three glycosyltransferases, a viral envelope protein and several proteins of the trans-Golgi network. Interestingly, the targeting signals for membrane proteins of the Golgi stacks seem to be contained in transmembrane domains. Information in the cytoplasmic tails is required for the targeting of trans-Golgi network proteins. Mechanisms involving both retention and retrieval have been invoked.",1
"Resident proteins of the exocytic pathway contain at least two types of information in their primary sequence for determining their subcellular location. The first type of information is found at the carboxyl terminus of soluble proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and in the cytoplasmic domain of some ER and Golgi membrane proteins. It acts as a retrieval signal, returning proteins that have left the compartment in which they reside. The second type of information has been found in the membrane-spanning domain of several ER and Golgi proteins and, though the mechanism by which it operates is still unclear, it acts as a retention signal, keeping the protein at a particular location within the organelle. The presence of both a retrieval signal and a retention signal in a trans-Golgi network resident protein suggests that more than one mechanism operates to ensure correct localization of resident proteins along the exocytic pathway.",1
"The long-standing biophysical question of how water crosses plasma membranes has been answered by the recent discovery of the aquaporins. Identification of this large family of membrane water-transport proteins has generated new questions about the physiological functions, tissue distributions, and regulatory mechanisms of individual aquaporins. The fast pace of developments in this field has also resulted in major discrepancies in published reports which warrant resolution.",1
Successful recovery of RNA viruses and functional RNA replicons from cDNA has greatly facilitated molecular genetic analyses of viral proteins and cis-regulatory elements. This technology allows the use of RNA virus replication machinery to express heterologous sequences. Both positive-strand and negative-strand animal RNA viruses have been engineered to produce chimeric viruses expressing protective epitopes from other pathogens and for transient expression of heterologous sequences.,1
"During the past year, several examples of cellular mRNAs have been described in which translational initiation occurs by internal ribosome binding, a mechanism hitherto thought to be restricted to picornaviral RNAs. New insights into the molecular mechanism of internal ribosome entry have been provided by the structural and functional analyses of both the internal ribosome entry sites and the protein factors that stimulate translation mediated by these elements.",1
"The outcome of a viral infection within the nervous system depends on a complex interplay between the virus, its target cell and the immune system. Recent research has elucidated a variety of mechanisms involved in these interactions and their role in the production of disease.",1
"Far from being simple hydrophobic anchors, it is now clear that the transmembrane α-helices of integral membrane proteins can participate in strong, specific interactions that are important in their folding and oligomerization. Crystallographic studies of 21 such helices have indicated that these interactions are similar to those described for soluble proteins. Helix-helix interactions are also important in the oligomerization of a number of proteins that have a single transmembrane α-helix. The interactions are rather specific, involving interhelical salt bridges, hydrogen bonds or precise packing interactions. In some cases, such oligomerization is required for exit from the endoplasmic reticulum. The transmembrane helices of some Golgi-residing proteins also contain sufficient information to ensure their retention in this compartment. Finally, interactions between transmembrane α-helices may be important in the mechanism of transmembrane signalling by a number of membrane-bound receptors.",1
"RNA pseudoknots result from Watson-Crick base pairing involving a stretch of bases located between paired strands and a distal single-stranded region. Recently, significant advances in our understanding of their structural and functional aspects have been accomplished. At the structural level, modelling and NMR studies have shown that a defined subset of pseudoknots may be considered as tertiary motifs in RNA foldings. At the functional level, there is evidence that the realm of functions encompassed by RNA pseudoknots extends from the control of translation in prokaryotes, retroviruses and coronaviruses to the control of catalytic activity in ribozymes and the control of replication in some plant viruses.",1
"The transmembrane region of many integral membrane proteins is made up of a bundle of hydrophobic α-helices. Such a structure could result from a two-stage folding process, during which preformed transmembrane helices with independent stability pack without topological rearrangement. This view was originally prompted by experiments in which fragments of transmembrane regions were separately refolded into lipid bilayers and subsequently brought together to yield a functional protein. Other lines of evidence, including the existence of ‘one-helix’ miniproteins, gene-fusion experiments, helix-driven oligomerization of bitopic proteins, and sequence rearrangements in the course of evolution support this view. Although it forms a useful basis for structural predictions, the limitations of the two-stage folding hypothesis are not clearly defined, and the proportion of integral membrane proteins to which it applies remains uncertain. The papers discussed in the present review illustrate recent progress along these lines.",1
"Viruses causing infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN) and infectious hematopoietic necrosis (IHN) were first isolated in Japan during the 1970s and these two diseases remain among the most serious problems affecting cultured salmonids in Japan. In addition to IHN and IPN, four other viral diseases cause major economic losses among cultured fishes in Japan. These include viral pancreatic hepatic necrosis of yellowtail, rhabdovirus infection of Japanese flounder and black rock fish, Kuchishiro-sho of tiger puffer fish, and epidermal hyperplasia or necrosis of Japanese flounder. Over the years, a number of other viruses have been isolated from, or have been observed by electron microscopy, in moribund fish. Members of 10 of the existing families of animal viruses are represented in this group. Their importance to the aquaculture industry in Japan is reviewed here.",1
"A number of new virus isolates from finfish have been reported in the scientific literature during the past five years. These include nine aquareoviruses, eight picornaviruses, six iridoviruses, five herpesviruses, three rhabdoviruses, three retroviruses, a paramyxovirus, and a coronavirus. Not all of these agents have been isolated in cell culture or established as etiologic agents of disease by controlled transmission studies. The burgeoning number of fish viruses is a reflection of the increased interest in fish diseases, particularly those occurring in aquaculture facilities, and the number will surely grow as fish farming intensifies on a global scale. This review chronicles the new virus isolates and lists them with other members of their virus family where appropriate.",1
"Worldwide, the number of communicable diseases of animals raised in aquaculture continue to increase. Viral infections of cultivated shellfish, crustacea, and finfish have been frequently recognized in the past few years. In the Asian regions, penaeid shrimp and several teleost fish underwent epizootics associated with heavy losses in aquaculture. Baculoviruses are particularly harmful to shrimp and prawns. Herpes-, irido-, reo-, or rhabdovirus-like agents can cause outbreaks in fish farms. Viral diseases are important limiting factors in the expansion of aquaculture. However, studies on viral infections of aquatic animals have been focused primarily on economically important farmed fish. Therfore, certain viral diseases of teleost fish are relatively well understood. In contrast, our knowledge of viral infections of farmed aquatic invertebrates is still very spare. Although a great number of viruses have been detected in farmed molluscs and crustaceans, the pathogenicity and epizootiology of most of the agents is not known.",1
"The diverse forms and functions of cellular organelles are, presumably, a consequence of their particular molecular compositions. The generation and maintenance of this diversity is achieved by the targeting of newly synthesized proteins to specific locations and their subsequent retention there. Sequences that retain proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) have been identified at the C-termini of resident ER proteins, where they are readily accessible to potential receptors. By contrast, recent results have demonstrated that retention of proteins in the Golgi complex involves sequences located within transmembrane domains. This suggests the novel possibility that the membrane composition of the Golgi complex plays a role in retention of resident Golgi proteins.",1
"Mycoplasmas excel as infectious agents, despite their very small genomes. In one mycoplasma species, adaptive flexibility is enhanced by an elegant genetic system that diversifies the membrane surface through a set of variable lipoproteins (Vlps). A family of vlp genes supplies divergent coding sequences and undergoes high-frequency mutations, thus creating large repertoires of surface mosaics and structural variants.",1
The novel role of antibody in clearing virus from the central nervous system without the help of other immune effectors is an important phenomenon that has only recently been documented. Possible routes for antibodies across the blood-brain barrier and how they work in the CNS are discussed here.,1
"Viral tissue tropism in a susceptible host is often determined by virus-receptor interactions. Nevertheless, closely related viruses utilizing the same receptor molecules can display striking differences in tropism, or a virus can cause a localized infection despite the widespread occurrence of the receptor. These events are now explained by another mechanism of tropism, in which host proteases play a major role by activating viral fusion glycoproteins.",1
"Certain enveloped viruses are known to assemble on membranes of the Golgi complex. Intracellular budding is facilitated by targeting of the viral glycoproteins to this organelle. It is likely that these viral glycoproteins are retained in the Golgi by the same means as are endogenous Golgi proteins. Consequently, the study of Golgi-specific viral proteins has provided important clues to the nature of Golgi retention signals.",1
Plant viruses transmitted by invertebrate vectors either reversibly bind to vector mouthparts or are internalized by the vector and later secreted. Viral proteins mediate the binding of plant viruses to vector mouthparts and the transport of virus across vector-cell membranes. Both mechanisms probably involve conformational changes of virus proteins during their association with the vector.,1
"The replication of JHM, a murine coronavirus, provides a useful model of the assembly and dissemination of viral components in neuronal cells. Involvement of microtubules in virus trafficking is an important feature which may explain dissemination of the infection from primary cell targets at olfactory, hippocampal and cerebellar sites within the central nervous system, resulting in severe neuropathies.",1
"Despite extensive documentation of prolonged antibody responses following vaccination or acute viral infection, the mechanisms behind long-term antibody production are not fully understood. We propose the hypothesis that long-lived plasma cells are an important, yet largely overlooked, component of long-term humoral immunity.",1
"The ability to genetically manipulate viruses has led to extraordinary advances in understanding virus biology and to the establishment of useful vector systems. Initially confined to DNA viruses and retroviruses, RNA viruses have more recently become attractive candidates for expression of heterologous genes and offer promising perspectives for biomedical applications.",1
Fatty acids are covalently attached to many membrane glycoproteins during their biosynthesis.,1
"The two glycoproteins of coronavirus envelopes have different functions in intracellular budding, cytopathic effects and virus infectivity, and have markedly different biochemical properties.",1
Enveloped viruses exploit the existing routes of membrane traffic to enter and leave the host cell. The similarity between viral envelopes and cellular membranes has allowed the use of animal viruses as probes to examine aspects of intracellular traffic.,1
The gag and pol genes of most retroviruses occur in different reading frames and their translation as a single polypeptide is carried out by ribosomal frameshifting in the −1 direction. The alignment of the different reading frames occurs by overlapping reading in response to at least two signals within the RNA: one is a heptanucleotide stretch at the frameshift site and the other is a stem-loop structure which occurs just downstream of the first signal.,1
"Two species of histones in sea urchin sperm (Sp H1 and Sp H2B) are chimeric molecules whose highly basic amino-terminal domains are dephosphorylated at the last stage of sperm cell differentiation, and rephosphorylated immediately following fertilization. The phosphorylated regions consist largely of repeating tetrapeptides with two basic residues flanking Ser-Pro residues (‘SPKK’ motifs) and are predicted to have β-turn secondary structures. Alteration of the charge and structure of the SPKK sites may play a role in the unusually dense DNA packaging of the mature sperm chromatin. The motif resembles the target site of cell-cycle-associated cdc2 kinases and is found in several other proteins whose nucleic acid affinities may be altered during the cell cycle.",1
"A survey of the available ultrastructural data on physiologically and pathologically occurring and virally-induced multinucleate giant cells (MNGCs) is presented. Emphasis is initially placed upon the bone osteoclast, the skeletal muscle myotube and the placental syncytiotrophoblast. The widespread occurence of MNGCs in a range of pathological situations is discussed, with emphasis upon the broad involvement of the macrophage in inflammatory responses. Many viruses produce cell fusion in vivo and in vitro when cell cultures are infected. Several examples are given. A clear distinction is drawn between viral fusion from “without” and viral fusion from “within” the cell. The cytopathic effect (CPE) of the animal and human retroviruses is discussed in considerable detail. The in vivo and in vitro formation of lymphocytic and macrophage MNGCs by HIV-1 is given extensive coverage. The possible significance of the presence of brain MNGCs of macrophage/microglial origin as a cellular feature of AIDS dementia is discussed. A new hypothesis is advanced relating to the possible role of endogenous C-type retrovirus in the physiological fusion of the invasive placental cytotrophoblasts to create the syncytiotrophoblast. The evolutionary and developmental significance of such an event in relation to the evolution of the placental mammals is discussed. The possible importance of MNGC formation in the depletion of the CD4+ population of T-lymphocytes in vivo in the clinical progression of the AIDS-related complex and AIDS is related to the potent fusogenic effect of HIV-1 when cell cultures are infected.",1
"Recent results have provided increasing evidence for the existence of an intermediate membrane compartment between the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex which seems to function in protein sorting and the regulation of membrane traffic in the early part of the exocytic pathway. Localization of resident marker proteins has shown that this compartment consists of both peripheral and central elements. The aim of the present review is to combine the data on the pre-Golgi compartment with previous ideas of membrane traffic at the ER-Golgi interface. We propose a model which describes how mobile, endosome-like elements of the pre-Golgi compartment function in the generation of the compositional and functional boundary between the widely distributed ER and the more centrally located Golgi stacks.",1
"In this review we discuss five groups of viruses that bud into, or assemble from, different compartments along the biosynthetic pathway. These are herpes-, rota-, corona-, bunya- and poxviruses. Our main emphasis will be on the virally-encoded membrane glycoproteins that are responsible for determining the site of virus assembly. In a number of cases these proteins have been well characterized and appear to serve as resident markers of the budding compartments. The assembly and dissemination of these viruses raises many questions of cell biological interest.",1
"Both host defense and viral genetic factors influence the development of viral infection and disease. Due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier, infection of the central nervous system creates additional complexities in interactions between a virus and its host. Stages in viral pathogenesis defined as (1) virus entry, (2) spread, (3) tropism, (4) virulence and injury to the host, and (5) the outcome of infection are discussed for viral infections in general and those aspects unique to infections of the central nervous system. Information about neuronal physiology and function has also been revealed through studying virus infection. An increased understanding of viral pathogenetic mechanisms and host response to infection raises interesting possibilities for vaccine development and for basic studies in neurology and neurobiology.",1
"In immunological terms the CNS is at a severe disadvantage in its ability to respond to infection by virus. First, both glial and neuronal cells normally do not express molecules of the major histocompatibility complex. Second, the most efficient cells for stimulating an immune response (leucocyte dendritic cells) are not present in the healthy CNS; and third, there is no specialized lymphatic drainage from the CNS to lymph nodes to enable the immune system to be quickly informed of the presence of an infection. Nevertheless, the immune system apparently copes with the vast majority of viral infections in the CNS. This is clearly evidenced by the reactivation of latent CNS viral infections in some immunosuppressed patients and the dramatic increase in the seventy of CNS disease in young or otherwise immunologically incompetent experimental animals infected with neurotropic viruses. The routes by which the CNS and the immune system may communicate and the varied ways in which an immune response may affect the outcome of a viral infection of the CNS are discussed.",1
"Theiler's virus strains GDVII and FA cause an acute encephalitis when injected intracerebrally into mice, whereas strains To, BeAn and DA establish a persistent infection and produce a chronic demyelinating disease. The chronic infection is also dependent on the mouse strain used, with susceptibility linked in part to the D locus of the MHC. The region of the virus genome associated with neurovirulence maps to the P1 region, encoding the capsid proteins, and to the 5′ non-coding region. There is evidence that BeAn DA virus persists in oligodendrocytes, where it reactivates to initiate demyelinating disease. Host factors are involved in the development of the lesion, including CD4+ T cell responses. These lymphocytes most probably mediate damage through activation of macrophages leading to local destruction of glial cells. Another possible pathological role for the immune system is the recognition of nerve cell antigens and the initiation of autoimmune disease. Such a virus-triggered phenomenon may well underlie human CNS diseases such as multiple sclerosis.",1
"Both clinical and experimental studies indicate that viruses can interact with the developing nervous system to produce a spectrum of neurological damage and brain malformations. Following infection of the pregnant woman, virus may indirectly or directly involve the fetus. Direct involvement is generally due to transplacental passage of the virus and invasion of fetal tissue. Resultant disease is determined by a variety of virus-host factors, including the developmental stage of the fetus at the time it is infected, the neural cell populations which are susceptible to infection, the consequent virus-infected cell interactions, and the mechanism and timing of viral clearance. There is a growing list of human viruses which injure the developing nervous system. There are also several experimental models in which congenital viral infections have been shown to result in a variety of brain malformations but with no evidence of the prior infection remaining at the time of birth.",1
"While glial cells of the central nervous system do not constitutively express class I or II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, astrocytes and microglial cells can be induced by a variety of factors to express these antigens. Oligodendrocytes have inducible class I but not class II elements. There are considerable differences in regulation of MHC antigen expression between glial cells from rodent and human brains, both in situ and in vitro. The consequence of glial cell MHC expression for immune interactions in the CNS is discussed in the context of glial cell antigen presentation capacity and neural cell susceptibility to cell-mediated immune effector mechanisms.",1
"A quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to detect and measure antibody to bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1) in cattle sera. The optical density produced from a single dilution of test serum was compared with a standard curve and the results were read and printed out from a computer interfaced to a multichannel ELISA reader. The printed results were expressed in ELISA units. The ELISA results obtained on 370 cattle sera were compared with those of the serum neutralisation test (SNT). An agreement of 90·5% was obtained when reciprocal SNT titres equal to or greater than 4 and IgG ELISA units equal to or greater than 50 were taken as indicative of a specific reaction. Of the 370 sera, 35 gave discrepant results of which 21 were SNT positive/IgG ELISA negative and 14 were SNT negative/IgG ELISA positive. When the SNT positive sera negative in the IgG ELISA were tested in an IgM ELISA, 19 were found to be positive. Thus, when the IgG and IgM ELISA results were combined the overall agreement between the ELISA and SNT increased to 95·7%. The IgG ELISA had a sensitivity of 82·4% and specificity of 94·4% relative to the SNT, whereas the combined IgG and IgM ELISA results gave a sensitivity and specificity of 98·3% and 94·4% respectively. There was a good positive correlation between the two tests (r = 0·86).",1
"The objective of this study was to apply the pertinent findings from gamma inactivation of virus infectivity to the production of high quality diagnostic reagents. A Gammacell 220 (Atomic Energy of Canada, Ltd., Ottawa, Canada § § Use of trade names is for identification only and does not imply endorsement by the Public Health Service or by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. ) was used to subject 38 viruses grown in either susceptible tissue cultures or embryonated chicken eggs to various doses of gamma radiation from a cobalt-60 source. The radiation required to reduce viral infectivity was 0·42 to 3·7 megarads (Mrad). The effect of gamma treatment on the antigenic reactivity of reagents for the complement fixation (CF), hemagglutination (HA) and neuraminadase assays was determined. Influenza antigens inactivated with 1·7 Mrad displayed comparable potency, sensitivity, specificity and stability to those inactivated by standard procedures with beta-propiolactone (BPL). Significant inactivation of influenza N1 and B neuraminidase occurred with >2·4 Mrad radiation at temperatures above 4°C. All 38 viruses were inactivated, and CF or HA antigens were prepared successfully. Antigenic potency remained stable with all antigens for 3 years and with 83% after 5 years storage. Influenza HA antigens evaluated after 9 years of storage demonstrated 86% stability. Gamma radiation is safer than chemical inactivation procedures and is a reliable and effective replacement for BPL in preparing diagnostic reagents.",1
"RNA pseudoknot structural motifs could have implications for a wide range of biological processes of RNAs. In this study, the potential RNA pseudoknots just downstream from the known and suspected retroviral frameshift sites were predicted in the Rous sarcoma virus, primate immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV), equine infectious anemia virus, visna virus, bovine leukemia virus, human T-cell leukemia virus (types I and II), mouse mammary tumor virus, Mason-Pfizer monkey virus, and simian SRV-1 type-D retrovirus. Also, the putative RNA pseudoknots were detected in the gag-pol overlaps of two retrotransposons of Drosophila, 17.6 and gypsy, and the mouse intracisternal A particle. For each sequence, the thermodynamic stability and statistical significance of the secondary structure involved in the predicted tertiary structure were assessed and compared. Our results show that the stem-loop structures in the pseudoknots are both thermodynamically highly stable and statistically significant relative to other such configurations that potentially occur in the gag-pool or gag-pro and pro-pol junction domains of these viruses (300 nucleotides upstream and downstream from the possible frameshift sites are included). Moreover, the structural features of the predicted pseudoknots following the frameshift site of propol overlaps of the HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 retroviruses are structurally well conserved. The occurence of eight compensatory base changes in the tertiary interaction of the two related sequences allow the conservation of their tertiary structures in spite of the sequence divergence. The results support the possible control mechanism for frameshifting proposed by Brierley et al. [1] and Jacks et al. [2, 3].",1
"Some clinical reports and epidemiological data suggest that a virus may play a role in the etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Following intracerebral injection of a neurovirululent strain of influenza A virus into mice, the virus was found to be particularly localized in neurons of the substantia nigra and hippocampus. Although efforts to detect virus particles in the brains, or antibodies in the serum or CSF of patients with PD have been generally unsuccessful, recent immunohistochemical work has revealed the presence of complement proteins and the interferon-induced MxA in association with Lewy bodies and swollen neuronal processes. Although a viral etiology for PD is not now widely accepted, we proposed such an hypothesis. Neurovirulent influenza A virus is a candidate, but some other viruses or complex infection of these viruses may be responsible for the formation of Lewy bodies and the later death of nigral neurons.",1
"Astham is recognized as the most common treatable chronic disease of the lung, afflicting over 100 million people of all age groups yet, despite therapeutic advances, there has been little impact on the rising morbidity and mortality from the disease. This article discusses ways in which molecular medicine can inform public health policy and clinical practice in the management of asthma. It focuses on the recognition that asthma is an inflammatory disorder, and that the public health burden of the disease can be reduced by identifying environmental factors that may trigger asthma in genetically susceptible individuals.",1
"The past 10 years has seen the rise of large numbers of small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) engaging in some or many of the aspects of drug research. Few of these companies have been able to take candidate drugs to market due to development costs not being met by funding opportunities, but those companies that have been able to challenge traditional big pharma in the marketplace. Most SMEs have instead supplied traditional pharma with pipeline candidate drugs, either by licensing them or by the large companies actually acquiring the whole of the SME which owns the intellectual property. Many other companies engage in providing traditional big pharma or other SMEs with technologies and services. Hundreds of such companies have arisen, many clustered around centres of academic excellence on the coasts of the USA, or in certain regions in Europe and Asia – such clustering of scientific prowess has changed the location of where even big pharma tends to perform its research. By 2006, a large proportion (but generally less than 50%) of new drugs could be track to an origin in an SME, trends indicate that the proportion will rise even though the common prediction that large pharma will abandon internal research in favour of in-licensing from SMEs remains far from reality.",1
"The use of drugs to treat human disease is a pursuit that extends back into our evolutionary ancestors. Drugs are powerful substances with a great capacity to cause harm if misused or overused. Even when used correctly, pharmaceuticals can elicit disputes about their relative harms and benefits in specific situations. The establishment of modern intermediaries – physicians or pharmacists – in the allocation of the most powerful drugs increases the potential for conflict between those who control the resource and those who desire access to it. The size and influence of the pharmaceutical–industrial complex places disproportionate power in those whose interests lie in promoting and expanding pharmaceutical use in society. The expense of certain drugs complicates equitable allocation, and the concentration of pharmaceutical power in Western, industrialized countries promotes research and drug discovery disproportionately for diseases that are prevalent in the wealthier nations. The increasing sophistication of drug action challenges the traditional model of using drugs as a means to treat pathological conditions and processes, and raises the specter of lifestyle and enhancement uses of pharmaceuticals. New means of drug discovery – such as the use of stem cells – have elicited debate about the relative values placed on the status of the embryo and the potential treatment for intractable conditions that could result from stem cell research. Finally, the overall emphasis on drugs as the first line defense against what ails us has provoked some societal soul-searching. In this chapter, we review some of the ethical issues attendant to drug production and distribution, including issues of safety, justice, economic inequality, and the changing demands for drugs that exceed therapeutic uses. Suggestions are made to make pharmaceutical companies more responsive to these issues and to make oversight bodies more responsible for their roles.",1
"Computational and experimental high-throughput screening are frequently used to discover new leads for drug design. Although novel ligands have been identified by these methods, it has become clear that screening hit lists are plagued by false positives. These nuisance compounds are ultimately found to be developmental dead-ends and are abandoned, often after considerable effort has been invested in them. Much work over the last decade has been devoted to exploring the origins of false-positive screening hits, and ligand promiscuity has emerged as one such cause. Well-known mechanisms of promiscuity include reactive species and privileged substructures. More recently, it has been found that some nonspecific screening hits form aggregates of 30–1000nm in diameter. It has been proposed that these aggregate particles are responsible for the promiscuous behavior of many false positives and that aggregate-forming compounds may be widespread among screening hits. This chapter will review the known mechanisms of ligand promiscuity with an emphasis on the recently described model of aggregation. Experimental and computational methods for identifying promiscuous compounds will be described, and some outstanding questions in the field will be considered.",1
"More than 40 compounds have been formally licensed for clinical use as antiviral drugs, and half of these are used for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. The others have been approved for the therapy of herpesvirus (herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV)), hepadnavirus (hepatitis B virus (HBV)), hepacivirus (hepatitis C virus (HCV)), and myxovirus (influenza, respiratory synctural virus (RSV)) infections. New compounds are in clinical development or under preclinical evaluation, and, again, half of these target HIV infections. Yet, quite a number of important viral pathogens (i.e., human papilloma virus (HPV), HCV, hemorrhagic fever viruses) remain in need of effective and/or improved antiviral therapies.",1
"In this perspective, we begin by describing the comparative protein structure modeling technique and the accuracy of the corresponding models. We then discuss the significant role that comparative prediction plays in drug discovery. We focus on virtual ligand screening against comparative models and illustrate the state of the art by a number of specific examples.",1

"Bronchiolitis is a common respiratory tract infection usually affecting infants and young children during annual epidemics. It is characterized by wheeze, respiratory distress, and poor feeding. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause for bronchiolitis and is amongst the most important pathogens causing respiratory infection in infants worldwide. The healthcare burden of bronchiolitis is large, due to large numbers of hospitalized infants and the high risk of nosocomial spread during epidemics. Most children will suffer only mild, short-lived symptoms. A small proportion will need admission to hospital, where treatment is generally supportive until the illness resolves. Some will require ventilatory support for which mortality can be up to 10%. Infants at high risk of severe disease include those born prematurely, those with chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised infants. RSV infects ciliated epithelial cells, causing sloughing of the epithelium, cytokine and inflammatory mediator release, increases in mucus production, and interstitial edema. Clinical manifestations of bronchiolitis are a combined result of viral toxicity and the immune response to infection. Innate immune responses are important to the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis, as severe infection tends to occur after maternal antibody protection has waned and before the infant's adaptive immune responses have matured. Immunoprophylaxis, in the form of intramuscular anti-RSV IgG1, is effective in reducing rates of hospitalization for high-risk infants.",1
"This overview describes the main categories of specific occupational disorders and it covers also how work exposures are potential determinants of common respiratory conditions. Acute inhalation injuries may present as inhalation fever or as acute tracheobronchitis and pneumonitis. Occupational asthma is the most frequent work-related respiratory disease. It may be caused by allergic sensitization to macromolecules of biologic origin or to chemicals of low molecular weight, as well as by (heavy) exposure to workplace irritants. The pneumoconioses are caused by the accumulation of dust particles or fibres in the lungs. They include silicosis, coal workers’ pneumoconioses, asbestosis and other less common pneumoconioses. Chronic beryllium disease is caused by a cell-mediated sensitization to beryllium and resembles sarcoidosis. Hard-metal lung disease is caused by sensitivity to cobalt and resembles hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Extrinsic allergic alveolitis or hypersensitivity pneumonitis is generally caused by sensitization to aerosolized biological antigens. Several types of infections may be related more or less specifically to work. Chronic obstructive lung disease is mainly caused by cigarette smoking, but exposure to dusts and gases contribute to its incidence. Similarly, bronchopulmonary cancer is not only caused by smoking, but also by occupational agents, most notably asbestos. Asbestos is also a cause of nonmalignant and malignant pleural disease.",1
"Pneumonia is the infection of the distal lower respiratory tract, principally the alveolar space, including the small bronchi and bronchioles. Pneumonia results from the proliferation of microorganisms at these sites in combination with the host response to the presence of microorganisms. A variety of pneumonia syndromes can be defined based on microbial etiology, underlying host defenses, clinical presentation, and site of acquisition. Because of the non-specific nature of the signs and symptoms, the diagnosis of pneumonia rests disproportionately on the presence of an infiltrate on chest radiograph. The frequent lack of a microbiologic diagnosis and the non-specificity of signs, symptoms, and radiographic infiltrates leads to frequent consideration of pneumonia in the differential diagnosis of many other pulmonary diseases. The etiologic spectrum of all types of pneumonia always includes the common community-acquired pathogens, with the spectrum broadening in response to either increasing immunocompromise or greater exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics. While new or previously unrecognized pathogens can play a role in management decisions, the major issue in pneumonia is the appearance of antibiotic resistant strains of known common bacterial pathogens. Lack of even minimally effective agents is more the issue for nonbacterial pneumonias. Immunomodulation, in the form of less immunosuppressive cancer and transplant chemotherapy, immunization, or specific immunomodulatory drugs holds some hope for improving pneumonia outcome in the future.",1
"‘Atypical pneumonia’ refers to a clinical syndrome associated with pneumonia (typically mild, nonlobar) and diverse upper respiratory tract and extrapulmonary manifestations. Clinical features overlap with bacterial pneumonia, and co-infection with both typical (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae or other bacteria) and atypical pathogens may occur. ‘Atypical’ pathogens include Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella spp. In large epidemiological studies, Mycoplasma pneumoniae has been implicated in 2–18% of community-acquired pneumonias; Chlamydia pneumoniae, in 2–8%; Legionella sp., 1–4%. Atypical pathogens lack cell walls and are resistant to β-lactam antibiotics but are usually susceptible to tetracyclines, macrolides, ketolides, and fluoroquinolone antibiotics. In this article, we also review other unusual causes of pneumonia which are transmitted by insects or vectors (e.g., Rocky Mountain spotted fever, cat scratch fever, Q fever, ehrlichiosis, Lyme disease, and tularemia). These diverse organisms are not found on Gram stain, and diagnosis requires special culture techniques or serological assays. We review the salient clinical and laboratory features of these various disorders, and discuss diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",1
"Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the number one cause of death from infectious diseases in the US, and the patient population that is affected is becoming increasingly more complex due to the presence of chronic illness which is commonly managed in outpatients who are at risk for pneumonia. The number one pathogen causing CAP is pneumococcus, which is commonly resistant to multiple antibiotics, thus complicating management. Other common pathogens include atypical organisms (Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae), Hemophilus influenzae, enteric Gram-negatives (especially in those with chronic illness and aspiration risk factors), and Staphylococcus aureus. Successful management requires careful assessment of disease severity so that a site-of-care decision can be made (outpatient, inpatient, intensive care unit), appropriate samples for diagnostic testing collected, and antibiotic therapy initiated in a timely and accurate fashion. Initial antibiotic therapy is empiric, but even with extensive diagnostic testing, less than half of all patients have an etiologic pathogen identified. All patients with CAP require therapy for pneumococcus, atypical pathogens, and other organisms, as dictated by the presence of specific risk factors. Because pneumonia has both short-term and long-term impact on mortality, it is also important to focus on prevention of this illness, which requires smoking cessation, and giving at-risk individuals both pneumococal and influenza vaccines.",1
"Viral infection accounts for a substantial proportion of cases of acute pneumonia especially among young children and the elderly, the immunocompromised, and those with comorbidities. Influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus are by far the most common causes of viral pneumonia followed by adenovirus, parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3, and influenza B. Other less common agents include picornaviruses, varicella-zoster virus, herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, and hantavirus. The newly identified human metapneumovirus also plays a role. Zoonotic infections caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus and avian influenza A/H5N1 are examples of acute ‘atypical’ pneumonia with epidemic and pandemic potentials. In general, there are no reliable clinical or radiological features to distinguish viral from other causes of pneumonia. Respiratory viruses often show seasonality and a predilection for certain host groups. These epidemiological features are helpful in gauging the differential diagnoses. Confirmation of infection relies on laboratory investigations based on conventional approaches including direct viral antigen detection by specific monoclonal antibodies, virus isolation, and serology, as well as modern molecular approaches to amplify viral nucleic acid present in clinical specimens. The available spectrum of antiviral agents and the window for effective application are narrow. Treatment of viral pneumonia is primarily supportive. Vaccines for general use are only available for influenza A and B.",1
"The cystatins comprise a superfamily of proteins related primarily by virtue of DNA and amino acid sequence homology. The superfamily consists so far of four distinct types of molecules ranging from the simpler low-molecular-weight type I and II cystatins, which function primarily to inhibit lysosomal cysteine proteinases (CPs), to the higher-molecular-weight type III and IV cystatins, which possess additional latent functions expressed only during episodes of injury and inflammation, or have evolved entirely novel inhibitory functions. The role cystatins play in respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD is poorly understood. However, they do modulate the immune response by acting directly on neutrophils, macrophages, and antigen presenting cells. It is also clear that they do not function independently of other proteolytic pathways involved in remodeling of the lung. Limited proteolysis inactivates cystatins allowing lysosomal CP activity to directly contribute to lung tissue degradation and also liberates kinins which signal through G-protein-coupled receptors to cause both constriction and dilation of the bronchioles, pain via stimulation of sensory nerves, mucus secretion, cough, and edema.",1
"Vaccines are preparations of weakened or killed viruses or viral subunits that trigger specific protective immunity. Vaccination is the single most effective tool for preventing communicable disease, highlighted by the achievements of the smallpox and poliomyelitis eradication programs and the rise in infections for which no effective vaccine is available: human immunodeficiency virus, malaria, worms, and tuberculosis. World Health Organization initiatives target acute respiratory diseases in infancy and early childhood with novel immunization approaches. Effective vaccines are needed urgently for viral respiratory diseases, but progress has been disappointingly slow. Vaccine candidates often show reduced efficacy in infancy, in partially immune adults, the immunocompromised, and the elderly. However, several promising vaccines are in clinical trial, and it is likely that vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza will be licensed within the next 5–10 years. Mucosally delivered influenza vaccine is now available, and novel adjuvants offer the prospect of better immunogenicity. Ideally, multivalent mucosal vaccines will be developed that provide protection against a spectrum of respiratory infections in specific target age groups.",1
"Respiratory viruses include rhinoviruses and enteroviruses (Picornaviridae), influenza viruses (Orthomyxoviridae), parainfluenza, metapneumoviruses and respiratory syncytial viruses (Paramyxoviridae), coronaviruses (Coronaviridae), and several adenoviruses. With the exception of adenoviruses, all possess an RNA genome. They are usually transmitted by direct hand to surface to hand contact and/or aerosol inhalation, and replicate in both upper and lower airways. Cellular and humoral immunity are both activated in response to respiratory viral infections as well as neural pathways, which contribute to distant inflammatory effects. Respiratory viruses are responsible for a wide variety of clinical syndromes including the common cold, acute otitis media, laryngitis, sinusitis, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, influenza, and exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Diagnosis of respiratory viral infections is primarily clinical and is further supported by laboratory techniques such as antigen detection, culture, serology and more recently nucleic acid detection. Preventive strategies are based on avoidance of risk factors and vaccination when indicated. Treatment modalities include over-the-counter and non-specific remedies along with a small number of specific antiviral medications such as the influenza neuraminidase inhibitors.",1
"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a condition characterized by lower respiratory tract symptoms, airflow obstruction, and airway inflammation. The natural history of COPD is punctuated by episodes of acute deterioration in respiratory health termed exacerbations. Exacerbations are responsible for much of the morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs associated with COPD, and also affect the rate of decline in lung function. Most exacerbations are caused by episodes of tracheobronchial infection. The clinical features comprise a worsening in symptoms beyond usual day-to-day variation. Examination may reveal tachypnea and signs of respiratory failure. Pathologically, exacerbations are associated with an increase in airway and systemic inflammation which, at least in more severe disease, is predominantly neutrophilic. Simple investigations are indicated to exclude differential diagnoses and assess exacerbation severity. Treatment aims to support respiratory function whilst drugs aimed at the underlying cause are able to act. The cornerstone of therapy is inhaled bronchodilators, with oral corticosteroids in all but the mildest exacerbations. Antibiotics are indicated if there has been a change in the character of the sputum. Some patients with respiratory failure will require supplemental oxygen or assisted ventilation. Strategies to prevent exacerbations include inhaled corticosteroids, long acting bronchodilators, and influenza vaccination.",1

"Mother’s milk delivered naturally through breast-feeding has been the sole source of infant nutrition in mammalian species for millions of years. Since human beings learned to domesticate cattle about 10,000 years ago, nonhuman mammalian milk also has been used to supplement or replace maternal milk in the human infant. The development and widespread use of commercially prepared infant formula products have been phenomena of the 20th century and notably of the past 6 decades. Additional information acquired during the last several years has reinforced existing concepts on the role of breast-feeding in protecting the infant against infections, in providing an ideal source of infant nutrition, in modulating infectious immune responses, and in suppressing the evolution of neoplasms and autoimmune disease later in life. 1 Over the past few decades, the immune responses on intestinal and respiratory mucosal surfaces to local infections have been intensely studied. These investigations have led to the development of concepts of immunity on mucosal surfaces of gastrointestinal, respiratory, and genitourinary tracts and identification of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) and local mechanisms of defense that are distinct from the internal (systemic) immune system. This chapter reviews existing information on major aspects of the physiologic, nutritional, immunologic, and anti-infective components of the products of lactation. Also discussed is the most recent evidence on the contribution of human milk to the development of immunologic integrity in the infant and its influence on the outcome of infections and other host-antigen interactions in the neonate.",1

"Since a long time, tourism education has been a topic of debate in academia and numerous studies have been published about the theme in some of the major international specialised journals (see e.g. Jafari & Ritchie, 1981; Airey & Johnson, 1999; Tribe, 2002). Some parts of the world, however, have been left out of the discussion for several years, as is the case of Latin America, only more recently addressed by Pizam (1999). Also, only a limited number of researchers have approached the topic of tourism education provision in countries of the region, such as Charles (1997), who wrote about the past and future development of tourism and hospitality education and training in the Caribbean region and Knowles, Teixeira, and Egan (2003) who presented a comparison of tourism and hospitality education in Brazil and in the United Kingdom (UK).",1
"As tourism is an important sector of the service economy and is a creator of jobs, there is a need to examine tourism education in relation to careers and employment. This is not to detract from the value of tourism as an area of academic study in its own right, but the vocational element of tourism education necessitates that it is considered in the wider labour market context. It is not sufficient to examine tourism education without considering the progression of individuals that undertake tourism studies with a possible view to entering employment and developing their careers in the industry. Furthermore, given the amount of employment opportunities available in the various tourism sectors and the ability of tourism development to generate jobs, tourism education is often the starting point in the training and development of human capital to undertake these occupations. Therefore, tourism education is closely related to employment and careers in the industry from both an individual perspective in terms of their personal career development and opportunities, and an organisational perspective in terms of the supply of labour available for the industry.",1
"Mobility and movement are of concern to academics working across the social sciences, and this article provides a critical evaluation of current geographical research on mobility. Mobilities are fundamental to our daily lives and to the functioning of societies and economies, and the article begins by examining how geographers have approached mobility and fixity during the past half century and why there appears to have been a resurgence of research on mobility in the past decade. Mobilities are entwined with complex power relationships and the article examines how governments and businesses have attempted to encourage and facilitate the movements of people and things, while controlling and regulating mobilities which are deemed to be threatening, out of place, and uncontrolled – such as the mobility of gypsies and illegal immigrants. The article examines how mobilities have frequently been pushed into the background in accounts of landscape and place, before showing how geographers have more recently begun to take account of movement, change, and dynamism in conceptualizing place and landscape. The final section examines how human geographers and social scientists have been paying increasing attention to the social and cultural dimensions of travel and transport, and focuses on recent work on the geographies of the car and driving.",1
"Geographically, disease distribution or occurrence can be perceived either as the locations where cases are found or as the places where the necessary circumstances for causing illness are prevalent. Spatial diffusion theory distinguishes between two dimensions of a diffusion process. On the one hand, the routes may be determined by proximity – spreading to nearby places – or by hierarchical levels – spreading between places in a stepwise manner. On the other hand, the structure of diffusion appears as either expansion or relocation. The geographical context of health and disease can be conceived as epidemiological landscapes or landscapes of exposure. These are dynamic, i.e., their contents and extensions will change over time. The epidemiological transition might appear as a spatial diffusion of diseases, but is rather the outcome of changing ecological preconditions for disease and disease determinants. Increasing spatial connectivity has radically altered the routes and speed of diffusion. Global and local environmental changes alter the prospects for health. In the future, climatic change might affect the living conditions for agents and vectors involved in disease ecology. Understanding the geographical diffusion of diseases is important for predicting and containing diseases. GIS can be very useful tools for public health surveillance, simulation, analysis, and early warning.",1
"This article examines the spatial distribution of leading infectious causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Beginning with simple models explaining the spatial pattern of infectious diseases, the epidemiologic transition, and disease ecology models, the article focuses on HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, polio, SARS, and influenza as well as sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea. It addresses the problem of disease strain mutation and especially drug resistance, and argues for the application of genotyping in medical geography research. The article emphasizes how migration and increased global interaction are producing a globalization of infectious diseases while at the same time, ethnic residential segregation is producing spatial concentrations of infectious disease or different strains of disease.",1
"Our conception of society–space determines the vantage point from which we critique and transform the social world; the subjects and processes we deem significant; and their relation to a social whole. This article treats four broad frameworks engaged by geographers, each providing distinct conceptual insights about society and space. In the first, a Marxist view of inequity, society–space is a ‘structured coherence’ – a sociospatial formation, whose territorial boundaries approximate politicojuridical boundaries. Geographers' work on the sociospatial dialectic, spatial fix, and time–space compression have leavened understandings of the spatial dynamics in this approach. The second, a post-structuralist/Foucauldian approach, sees society–space as a ‘strategic field’. Space forms part of the technology of governance that constitutes subjects either as normal/abnormal, legal/illegal, or through states of exception – such as the enemy noncombatant or the illegal alien. In the third, a post-structuralist/feminist approach, society–space is seen as a ‘performative field’ in which subjects negotiate doubled positions and paradoxical spaces – affording insights into larger societal constructs such as the gendering of public/private spheres; racialized people's passing in a white world; or transsexuals performance of sexuality. In the fourth, a Deleuzian approach, society–space is an ‘immanent field’ in which subjects continuously transform themselves, hybridizing, engaging in acts of conjunction, connection, or collaboration with their milieu. Society–space is understood as stabilizing from the composite lattice of practices that are coded and channeled into a kind of social machine.",1
"Rapid progress in the synthetic application of benzotriazole derivatives in the last 20 years has resulted in over 1000 scientific papers on the subject. This fact is reflected in Section 5.01.7, which involves almost a half of the volume of this chapter. The section is arranged according to hybridization of the C-α atom and atomic numbers of the atoms in positions β and γ to allow an easy access to the material of interest. Recent discovery of copper catalysis in [3+2] cycloadditions of azides to acetylenes, the so-called ‘click chemistry’, which boosted application of the 1,2,3-triazole derivatives, especially in medicinal chemistry, is presented in Section 5.01.9. From the point of view of practical applications, Section 5.01.11 is organized according to the number, position, and combination of the substituents at the aromatic rings. Another novel feature that has no precedence in the previous editions of Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry is an addition of triazole and benzotriazole complexes with various transitions metals to Section 5.01.4.",1

"Many tissues, including the brain, contain all components of the renin–angiotensin system and generate angiotensin peptides independent of the systemic, circulating system. Within the brain renin, some questions remain as to how the precursor, angiotensinogen, and its processing enzymes interact to produce the active compounds, angiotensin II/III, because they are rarely localized to the same brain nucleus let alone the same cell. These questions aside, there is clear evidence for actions of angiotensin peptides in regions behind the blood–brain barrier. Receptors for angiotensin peptides, including AT1 and AT2 receptors, are distributed in a characteristic pattern throughout the brain, with many of these sites behind the blood–brain barrier. Stimulation of these receptors affects multiple physiological functions – actions which often complement the physiological roles established for the systemic renin–angiotensin system. These include effects on fluid and electrolyte homeostasis, autonomic and neuroendocrine regulation, and modulation of sensory function. Moreover, administration of selective receptor antagonists attenuates several of these functions when they are activated in response to physiological stimuli, such as dehydration. Together, these observations point to important roles for brain-derived angiotensin peptides in a wide range of physiological functions.",1

"Publisher Summary This chapter provides a brief historical introduction and the distinction between hydrolysable and condensed tannins, a description of their chemistry and a short historical review on their use in leather tanning, the more recent developments in tannins for adhesives with and without the use of any aldehyde-yielding compounds, even without the use of any hardeners. Examples of the use of tannins for other industrial, nonleather, applications are reported. In particular, this chapter focuses briefly on their new intended use in the medical and pharmaceutical fields. New data on their antiviral effectiveness against a great number of different viruses compared to their higher, lower, or absent cytotoxicity are also presented.",1
"This article summarizes current knowledge about the migratory behavior of temperate and tropical bats. A close association between migration and hibernation exists in temperate, but not in tropical, bats. Compared with birds, bats are relatively short-distance migrators, with maximum migration distances being <2000km; intercontinental migration is likely to be uncommon in bats. Migratory bats have lower levels of population subdivision and larger genetically effective population sizes than nonmigratory bats. A variety of methods, including banding, genetic analyses, stable isotope analyses, and tracking with radio or satellite transmitters, are currently being used to study bat migration. The conservation of migratory bats poses special challenges that require national and international efforts. Migratory bats sometimes harbor pathogens that can be transmitted to humans. Overall, the beneficial aspects of migratory bats, including control of insect populations and dispersal of pollen and seeds over broad areas, far outweigh their negative aspects.",1
"While epidemiological models have traditionally assumed that diseases spread by the mass action principle, actual contact networks within social groups do not meet this assumption. Theoretical models have shown that disease dynamics could vary considerably under different types of contact networks, but these models face challenges in terms of their evaluation due to the difficulty of collecting empirical data. The honeybee colony with its elaborate social organization and large repertoire of diseases provides an ideal setting to explore how the structure of the contact network contributes to the transmission of a disease.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter presents a brief overview of how new drug discovery projects begin, some of the science and business decisions that go into them, what types of projects researchers can expect to see, and how targets are identified and validated. Projects tend to have some commonalities that allow most of them to be divided up into several bins, if the bins are made large enough.. The term target validation can mean different things to different people. To a chemist proposing a new project it might refer to affirmative evidence from a mouse knockout or even just an RNA interference experiment in cells. To a clinician it probably means no less than proven statistically significant efficacy by a drug in large-scale, controlled human trials. Target validation, that is, systematically building up evidence that the interaction of a proposed target with an agent like a small molecule or a monoclonal antibody (mAB) can have a therapeutic effect in a human disease state, is often far from trivial. It represents an ongoing, labor-intensive process that can be rate-limiting, but is necessary to avoid disastrous losses in time, money, and manpower that occur when a clinical drug fails to work because its target is not at all crucial to disease progression or symptoms. Target identification, in this case the process whereby a new target is first proposed based on some minimal evidence, is less cumbersome but still requires devoted resources. The beauty of working on a project based upon an already established target is that both of these steps can be skipped.",1

"A large body of evidence points to the existence of a close, dynamic relationship between the immune system and the male reproductive tract, which has important implications for our understanding of both systems. The testis and the male reproductive tract provide an environment that protects the otherwise highly immunogenic spermatogenic cells and sperm from immunological attack. At the same time, secretions of the testis, including androgens, influence the development and mature functions of the immune system. Activation of the immune system has negative effects on both androgen and sperm production, so that systemic or local infection and inflammation compromise male fertility. The mechanisms underlying these interactions have begun to receive the attention from reproductive biologists and immunologists that they deserve, but many crucial details remain to be uncovered. A complete picture of male reproductive tract function and its response to toxic agents is contingent upon continued exploration of these interactions and the mechanisms involved.",1
"The house-building industry has three main functional sectors: residential land development, housing production, and house marketing and sales. It also has close links with hundreds of upstream and downstream industries in an economy. While the house-building industries in North America and Western Europe are relatively mature, those found in many parts of the Asia-Pacific region are still under development. Despite their short average history, the house-building industries in the region are growing fast and have been the engines for economic development in the region. This overview of the house-building industries in Japan, South Korea, Singapore, China, Thailand, and Malaysia focuses on important differences in the maturity and pace of development across jurisdictions. Fast economic growth in the less developed countries has offered opportunities for intensive development in the industry. Yet, issues like quality assurance and environmental sustainability have posed challenges to the house-building sector in the region.",1

"Publisher Summary Carbohydrates are essential biological molecules carrying important biological information. Carbohydrates are prominently displayed on the surface of cell membranes and expressed by virtually all secretory proteins in bodily fluids. This is achieved by the events of posttranslational protein modification called glycosylation. Importantly, expression of cellular glycans, in the form of either glycoproteins or glycolipids, is differentially regulated. Cell display of precise complex carbohydrates is characteristically associated with the stages or steps of embryonic development, cell differentiation, as well as transformation of normal cells to abnormally differentiated tumor or cancer cells. Sugar moieties are also abundantly expressed on the outer surfaces of the majority of viral, bacterial, protozoan, and fungal pathogens. Many sugar structures are pathogen specific, which makes them important molecular targets for pathogen recognition, diagnosis of infectious diseases, and vaccine development. Exploring the biological information content in carbohydrates is one of the current focuses of postgenomic research and technology development. Biophysical, biochemical, and immunological methods have proven very valuable in studying carbohydrate–carbohydrate and carbohydrate–protein interactions. Many well established immunochemical methods have been applied to determine the specificity and cross-reactivity of carbohydrate–antibody and carbohydrate–lectin interactions. A pressing need is, thus, the establishment of high-throughput technologies to enable the large-scale, multiplex analysis of carbohydrates and their cellular receptors. These include especially the characterization of immunological properties of carbohydrates that are important for medical applications of carbohydrate antigens and interactions of carbohydrates with other biomolecules or intact cells that play key roles in establishing comprehensive biological functions of essentially all existing living organisms.",1

"Although viruses are simple biological systems, they are capable of evolving highly efficient techniques for infecting cells, expressing their genomes, and generating new copies of themselves. It is possible to genetically manipulate most of the different classes of known viruses in order to produce recombinant viruses that express foreign proteins. Recombinant viruses have been used in gene therapy to deliver selected genes into higher organisms, in vaccinology and immunotherapy, and as important research tools to study the structure and function of these proteins. Virus-like particles (VLPs) are multiprotein structures that mimic the organization and conformation of authentic native viruses but lack the viral genome. They have been applied not only as prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines but also as vehicles in drug and gene delivery and, more recently, as tools in nanobiotechnology. In this article, basic and advanced features of viruses and VLPs are presented and their major applications are discussed. The different production platforms based on animal cell technology are explained, and their main challenges and future perspectives are explored. The implications of large-scale production of viruses and VLPs are discussed in the context of process control, monitorization, and optimization. The main upstream and downstream technical challenges are identified and discussed accordingly.",1
"Proteases are ubiquitous in biosystems where they have diverse roles in the biochemical, physiological, and regulatory aspects of cells and organisms. Proteases represent the largest segment of the industrial enzyme market where they are used in detergents, in food processing, in leather and fabric upgrading, as catalysts in organic synthesis, and as therapeutics. Microbial protease overproducing strains have been developed by conventional screening, mutation/selection strategies and genetic engineering, and wholly new enzymes, with altered specificity or stability have been designed through techniques such as site-directed mutagenesis and directed evolution. Complete sequencing of the genomes of key Bacillus and Aspergillus workhorse extracellular enzyme producers and other species of interest has contributed to enhanced production yields of indigenous proteases as well as to production of heterologous proteases. With annual protease sales of about $1.5–1.8 billion, proteases account for 60% of the total enzyme market. Detergent proteases, with an annual market of about $1 billion account for the largest protease application segment. Subtilisin Carlsberg and related subtilisin serine proteases represent the first generation of detergent proteases with pH optima of 9–10. The second generation, having higher pH optima (10–11) and greater temperature stability, is produced from alkalophilic strains including Bacillus clausii and B. halodurans. The third generation consists of detergent proteases whose active sites and/or stability have been modified by protein engineering. The principal applications of proteases in food processing are in brewing, cereal mashing, and beer haze clarification, in the coagulation step in cheese making, in altering the viscoelastic properties of dough in baking and in production of protein hydrolysates. In organic synthesis, proteases have application in synthesis and/or hydrolysis of peptide, ester, and amide bonds involving carboxylic acids and are effective tools for resolution of pairs of enantiomers. Proteases have applications in nutrition as digestive aids and in therapy in thrombosis and cancer treatment. Hyperproteolytic endogenous activity may play significant roles in abnormal physiological functioning as well as in microbial and viral pathophysiological conditions and this has created substantial momentum for development of protease inhibitors as therapeutic agents against disease-causing proteases.",1

These need to be addressed in the near future to promote the development of genomic medicine.",1
"Main-group element compounds were among the first developed in the modern era as pharmaceutical preparations for the treatment of a wide variety of human ailments; it is now recognized that many of these elements exist in traditional medicine of many societies, for example, arsenic. The use of main-group element compounds in contemporary medicine continues for the treatment of, for example, depression (Li), stomach ulcers (Bi), cancer (As and Ga), and leishmaniasis (Sb). Not surprisingly, new compounds of these elements, and other main-group elements, continue to be investigated for their potential use in new therapies. In this chapter, the use of main-group elements as therapeutic agents is outlined and also, where understood, comments on biological targets and mechanisms of action. Further, key advances in new potential applications of main-group element compounds in medicine are evaluated.",1
"Our lives depend upon a constant supply of clean air to breathe, in the home, city, countryside or at our place of work. Air is also consumed in huge volumes for the production of power. Any particulate matter in this air will affect the efficiency and cleanliness of combustion and reduce the lifetime of engine or turbine parts. The off-gases downstream from combustion present a huge environmental problem, either in the local environment or in terms of their impact regionally or even globally. This section reviews the techniques and equipment used to purify air.",1
"This chapter synthesizes current knowledge on phytochemistry, bioactivity, molecular phylogeny, and omics of Polygoneae medicinal resources. Many species in the seven genera of Polygoneae are traditional and popular medicinal herbs. Anthraquinones and stilbenes are characteristic medicinal compounds of Polygoneae, while other useful constituents, such as alkaloids, glycosides, flavonoids, volatile oils, tannins, resins, coumarins, and lignans, have also been isolated from Polygoneae species. Among versatile bioactivities of Polygoneae compounds, their effects on the cardiovascular and nervous systems and their anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiparasitic, insecticidal, anticancer, and antioxidant activities are highlighted. Interspecific hybridization and the following polyploidization play a major role in Polygoneae diversification. Nuclear ITS and chloroplast DNA sequences are retrieved to resolve the interspecific relationship and reassign some taxa to the appropriate genus. Omics study of Polygoneae is at the budding stage, which will revolutionize the sustainable utilization of Polygoneae medicinal resources.",1

"Cross-contamination is an increasingly important risk factor in food safety. Cleaning and disinfection regimens are essential components in its prevention but need to be validated, monitored, and verified. This in turn requires the implementation of protocols for surface sampling and the assessment of residual contamination. Visual assessment although widely used, in isolation, is ineffective but can be useful as part of an integrated approach. Microbial and nonmicrobial methods of sampling and testing are compared. Nonmicrobial assessment methods, especially ATP, are effective at monitoring residual surface soil. Traditional specific, and nonspecific, microbial methods indicate residual microbial contamination but not surface soil. Recent advances in molecular microbial methods and bioluminogenic tests are discussed. There is no single ideal surface test method and how, when, and where to sample are discussed within the framework of suggested guidelines, an integrated approach, and the use of trend analysis.",1

"The use of textiles in transportation may be associated with the need to combine comfort and functionality. The evolution of each mean of transportation along with the increased awareness about the importance of passengers' safety pushed research and development forward towards a larger use of lightweight, fire-resistant, nontoxic, and durable textiles in transportation. This in turn led to the development of test methods assessing the different aspects of textiles in transportation. This chapter starts with a presentation of the transportation textile market. Then, different aspects of textile testing relevant to the transportation industry are discussed: safety, flammability, hygiene, performance of composite parts, and durability. The chapter ends with considerations regarding future trends for textiles in transportation.",1
"Raising replacement dairy kids begins with prenatal care of the doe. The doe needs to be properly vaccinated before kidding, be in proper body condition, and have good nutrition, including vitamins and minerals. A program to prevent caprine arthritis encephalitis must be instituted, which involves removal of the kid from the doe at birth, feeding heat treated colostrum the first day of life, and feeding with milk replacer, heat treated milk, or a mixture thereafter. Milk should be fed generously (3 times a day) to 2weeks of life. Milk consumption can become limited by feeding 0.5l per feeding, twice a day. More milk can be fed, by feeding 3 times a day or using acidified or cold milk procedures. A high-quality starter feed should be fed beginning the second week of life. A kid must be a minimum of 6weeks of age to be weaned, weigh at least 10kg, and have a starter intake of at least 250gday−1. Kids can be transitioned to weaning by reducing milk feeding to one time a day. After weaning, the kid should be fed 360g of starter feed per day and all of the high-quality hay they can eat. The kid should gain 150gday−1 from birth and weigh 35kg by 7months of age when they can be bred. Kid health problems can be prevented by consumption of adequate colostrum, well-ventilated environment, avoiding crowding, and good sanitation. Attention needs to be given to making gradual changes in feeding.",1
"Replacements are the future of the dairy industry. Focusing on improving health management of replacements will yield tremendous returns through decreased losses of animals with the greatest genetic potential on the dairy, decreased costs of medication, improved growth rates, improved feed efficiency and earlier entry into the milking herd. Health management begins before replacements are born with attention to the nutrition of lactating and dry cows, the vaccination of lactating and dry cows, control of length of the dry period and both control of the disease status of the dams and the cleanliness of the calving environment. Greater attention must be paid to animal and environmental biosecurity to prevent introduction of diseases into the herd and to digestive disorders such as diarrhea, internal parasites and appropriate vaccination programs for the calves. Health management of replacements is often overlooked because producers do not see the immediate returns for their efforts. Common sense management in cattle, historical facts, experience based practice cultural and social aspects, combined with research, would depict that having adequately optimised balanced diets for the replacements, without producing excessive body conditions, could achieve a production of healthy replacements with superior levels of milk production. Continual video monitoring of the herd, modern thermal infrared imaging of the dry cows and calves body parts to identify early symptoms, and overall animal health and biosecurity risk analysis could achieve a sustainable and efficient replacement management practice in cattle industry.",1
"Domestic buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) of swamp type (for draught) and river type (for milk) dominate the tropical Asia with slightly more than 169.4 million. They breed throughout the year and produce two calves every 3 years and are fed mainly on straw, crop residues, and mineral supplements. Assisted reproductive technologies such as artificial insemination and embryo transfer have also been introduced and implemented in buffalo production with less success due to difficulty in detecting estrus. Providing good feed and feeding remain a challenge in buffalo husbandry due to limited feed resources. With improved management and proper breeding, the milk production from buffaloes has increased from 1500 to 5000l per lactation. The river type buffalo currently produces about 73.2 million tonnes of milk annually.",1
"The buffaloes reared in the Mediterranean region are the Asian buffalo or water buffalo, that is, Bubalus bubalis. This species includes two types: (1) the river type, with 50 chromosomes, with an adult male weighing between 450 and 1000kg and with an annual milk production of 1000–3000kg; and (2) the swamp type, with 48 chromosomes, with an adult male weighing between 325 and 450kg and with an annual milk production of up to 600kg. The river buffalo is reared mainly for milk, whereas the swamp buffalo is reared mainly for draught. Only 3% of the world buffalo population is reared in the Mediterranean region. Significant numbers of buffaloes are at present found only in Italy, Romania, Egypt, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Iraq and Iran. In all these countries, buffaloes represent only a very small portion of total livestock, except in Egypt, where buffaloes are more numerous than cattle. Because of the strong market demand for buffalo cheese, the number of buffaloes has increased in Italy and there is a preference for buffalo dairy products compared to cows' milk products in a few countries. Major morphological differences between the buffalo populations of different countries include (1) the variable size, ranging between a minimum of 280 and 300kg liveweight for adult females and males, respectively, in Egypt to a maximum of 900 and 1000kg in Iraq, the most frequent weights being 600 and 800kg; (2) the shape of the horns; and (3) the coat color, from dark gray and dark brown to black, showing white spots in some cases.",1

It opens with a survey of how the People's Republic has deployed the internet as part of a transition into a globalized capitalist economy. Although the state has enjoyed some successes such as telemedicine, much e-government is designed to legitimate and enhance the authoritarian rule of the Communist Party, and/or to improve economic efficiency. China has a rich array of municipal e-government programs, led by Shanghai and Beijing. The chapter notes China's severe internet censorship. In contrast, Hong Kong and Taiwan provide sophisticated e-government models that promote citizen participation and enhance the daily quality of life.",1

In spite of the corporatization, China’s publishing houses were never intended to be pure business entities, and many continue to rely on monopolistic profits or government subsidies for their financial viability. The digital transformation in publishers is heavily shaped and constrained by the institutional problems of the publishing industry.",1

"The unique characteristics of polyolefins make them the best candidates in single use healthcare products, medical textiles, and water filters. Most medical textiles and polymeric materials used in hospitals and hotels are good media for cross-transmission of diseases since most microorganisms can survive on fibrous materials for several hours to several months. Use of medical devices with antimicrobial functions has been considered as a major avenue to fight against microbial infections. In addition, suitable packaging can slow the deterioration rate, and hence, extend the shelf-life of food. Physical and chemical incorporation of antimicrobial agents into polyolefins can be implemented in common polyolefin processing. In this chapter, antimicrobial polyolefins are summarized based on processes that were studied to incorporate biocides into the polymers. These processes include blending, coating, and chemical modifications.",1

"Fueled by globalization and human behavior, communicable diseases pose a serious threat to humankind despite unparalleled technological advances. New viruses and devastating communicable diseases such as Ebola and Zika are emerging; diseases previously considered eradicated such as measles are reemerging, while antibiotic resistance is increasing to dangerously high levels worldwide. Increased human population and accelerated global travel make local outbreaks instant global threats. Researchers are concerned that an avian influenza outbreak could kill many more people when it emerges because of the absence of immunity and human travel interaction patterns. Yet the threat of communicable disease varies by geographic location—where you live matters. This entry examines the spatial patterns of familiar communicable diseases, including the syndemic of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis, as well as new diseases such as Ebola, Zika, and dengue. It highlights the huge potential of mapping communicable disease genotypes while raising the alarm on the urgent need for effective global disease surveillance systems and new tools for fighting communicable diseases. Because communicable diseases do not respect political boundaries, global cooperation is vital to prevent this threat to humankind.",1
"Emerging and infectious diseases have persisted as leading causes of global morbidity and mortality. Caused by pathogens including bacteria, viruses, parasites, or fungi, they are known to pose serious health threats to the world's population dating back to ancient Egypt. In the 14th Century alone, infectious diseases were responsible for decimating 20–45% of the world's population. The discovery of vaccines, coupled with improved sanitation, hygiene, and health care, witnessed the eradication of several infectious diseases, although some have resurfaced or are resurfacing since the latter part of the 20th Century. While geography partly define hotspots for emerging and infectious diseases, low socioeconomic development, poverty, and underfunded health care systems remain driving forces for the reoccurrence of these diseases among vulnerable populations who experience material deprivation. To eradicate infectious diseases, a global response will have to prioritize the allocation of resources by way of expertise and technology to areas that are most affected. Furthermore, an effective surveillance system, and a rigorous vaccine deployment regime targeting vulnerable persons and regions is desirable in mitigating the impacts of these diseases.",1
"Interdisciplinarity employs multiple academic fields of knowledge in order to create a comprehensive understanding of a globally relevant phenomenon, a region, or its people, and to find solutions to concrete problems. Interdisciplinarity evolved in the 20th century in response to the institutionalization and segmentation of academic research and major transitions in society. Many geography departments have interdisciplinary profiles, but the daily practice of interdisciplinarity depends on the networks of individual academics. The results of interdisciplinary collaboration include research books, textbooks, and journal articles, the market of which continues to diversify. Authors of interdisciplinary textbooks and teachers of interdisciplinary classes must pay special attention to teaching philosophy and communication skills in order to satisfy the needs of a heterogeneous body of students interested in interdisciplinary learning. Interdisciplinarity means different things in different contexts, and practices and challenges vary. Some see interdisciplinarity as an exciting opportunity, while others feel threatened by the downsides of crossing disciplinary boundaries.",1

"Medical waste is a source of generation of hazardous biomedical waste. Medical waste generation and disposal is an important aspect, especially in countries with poor hygiene and high population. Medical centers including hospitals, clinics, and places where diagnosis and treatment are conducted generate wastes that are highly hazardous and put people under risk of fatal diseases. Policies should be framed to avoid spread of infections by providing specification for handling waste for generation, segregation, collection, storage, transportation, and treatment. Awareness should be created at all levels of society through various means of communication and education, so that the risks of spreading the health hazards could be minimized. This chapter deals with medical waste, principles of waste management program, categories of health-care waste, parameters to be monitored in health-care waste, finances to be managed, and national plans for health-care waste.",1
"Biologically mediated inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) are considered as a green, cheap, and environmental-friendly materials, which connect the nanotechnology and biomedical sciences. Metallic NPs such as gold and silver NPs, synthesized using natural materials are an important branch of inorganic NPs with catalytic functionalities and a diverse range of biomedical applications such as antimicrobial application. Polysaccharides are excellent candidates to stabilize and control the size of NPs during the synthesis process. These polymers possess multiple binding sites, which facilitate attachment to the metal surface. As a result, polysaccharides can effectively create an organic-inorganic network of the metal NPs and confer a significant protection against aggregation and chemical modifications. This chapter discusses the methods of the preparation of polysaccharide-mediated NPs and reviews various types and diverse applications for these novel materials.",1
"Conventional disinfection methods are limited by reliance on the operator to ensure appropriate selection, formulation, distribution, and contact time of the agent. Automated room disinfection (ARD) systems remove or reduce reliance on operators and so they have the potential to improve the efficacy of terminal disinfection.

"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the structure feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and pathogenesis of lymphomas and leukemias BY FeLV. FeLV is quite similar to the better-studied murine leukemia viruses in structure and genetic map. The virus particles bud from cytoplasmic membranes into either extracellular spaces or into vacuoles. FeLV has long been considered a typical noncytopathogenic, longlatency leukemia virus based on its behavior in fibroblasts in vitro. Recent evidence suggests that its in vivo behavior in critical target hemolymphatic tissues is as likely to be cytopathic as transforming. The type of FeLV-related disease that occurs and the disease-free interval probably are influenced by viral envelope proteins and glycoproteins and the consequences of proviral integration. FeLV subgroup specificity apparently determines when and what type of disease will occur. The ecotropic FeLV-A is the most frequent subgroup found in pet cats and is transmitted contagiously. Immunosuppression is the most frequent and the most devastating manifestation of FeLV viremia in clinical and experimental studies. It seems that multiple cell types and multiple processes are involved in the development of feline retrovirus-induced immunosuppression. Although no solid evidence is available for the malfunctioning of cat T helper cells because of the paucity of T-cell specific markers, the circumstantial evidence provided thus far indicates an impaired T helper function in FeLV-infected cats similar to that observed in humans infected with HIV. Studies on the pathogenesis of FeLV-induced immunosuppression might provide a valuable mode for a better understanding and means of control of human AIDS.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter reviews the development of some of vaccines and their use in controlling such major diseases as diphtheria, rinderpest, Newcastle disease, smallpox, pertussis, yellow fever, rabies, etc. Park–Williams Number 8 (PW8) strain is used to make diphtherial toxoid for vaccines. As a source of toxin, it is rendered nontoxic by incubation with formalin under alkaline conditions. The product's retention of antigenicity, enabling it to induce antitoxin antibodies, makes it an excellent pediatric vaccine. Vaccine against Rinderpest Virus was developed by Koch in 1897 by administering bile from infected cattle. Animals that survived were permanently immune. Formalin- and chloroform-inactivated vaccines were developed using tissues from the infected animals. For the control of Newcastle disease, a number of attenuated live-virus vaccines have been developed which are widely used to control the disease. The Bl strain, the LaSota strain, and the F strain are used to immunize birds of all ages by different routes, including by addition to drinking water and by spraying. Protection against rabies correlates with SN antibody, which can be assessed by a number of tests. Pasteur's classical vaccine, developed from infected spinal cord tissue dried at room temperature for 3–14 days, was given in a series of 21–28 inoculations beginning with material dried the longest and progressing through material dried for only 3 days.",1

"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the infections caused by DNA viruses and also RNA viruses. The chapter focuses on the detection, diagnosis, risk assessment, and decision-making regarding viral infections. Several infections caused by DNA viruses are parvoviruses, rat cytomegalovirus, poxviruses, adenovirus, and papovavirus. Several RNA viruses and infections caused by these viruses are coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses, rotavirus and reovirus, and picornaviruses. Monitoring for viral infections should cover at least three venues: animals in established breeding and experimental colonies, animals held in entry quarantine, and animal tissues and products destined for in vivo use. For established colonies, monitoring should be tailored to local conditions. Effective monitoring should encompass sampling on a pre-arranged schedule, which can be intensified if evidence or suspicion of viral infection emerges. Because viral infections of rats can spread insidiously, early detection and epidemiologic “staging” should employ a detection matrix that includes clinical observation, appropriate sampling, and sensitive and specific diagnostic testing.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter reviews the basic principles of medical management of rat colonies and diagnostic approaches to detect infectious diseases of rats. Due to the fact that a comprehensive colony health monitoring program is so vital in protecting the validity and reproducibility of experimental research data, it must be devoted an appropriate priority in terms of budget, personnel, and other resources. The policies and practices should be defined in written plans, and agreement with the principles set forth should be secured by the scientific and administrative leadership of the institution, as well as by the veterinary and animal care group. Programs should be designed to monitor individual animal health through the use of direct methods such as close observation and physical examination. A program created to monitor the overall health status of a colony population often utilizes more indirect methods. Routine testing of selected representative animals (even in the absence of any signs of illness or disease) can provide valuable information regarding the viral, parasitic, and bacterial agents that such animals are either currently harboring or have been exposed to in the past. Risk analysis should be done by any institution planning on holding rodents, a process that should involve a discussion of the relative costs and benefits of the various options available for routine health monitoring as well as quarantine isolation and testing.",1

"Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on the tissue distribution, structure, and functions of the leucocyte antigen CD13. CD13 is expressed by granulocytes and monocytes and their precursors. CD13 is a marker for most acute myeloid leukaemias and a smaller proportion of acute lymphoid leukaemias. Various nonhematopoietic cells express CD13, including epithelial cells from renal proximal tubules and intestinal brush border, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, brain cells, bone marrow stromal cells, osteoclasts, and cells lining the biliary caniculae. CD13 is a member of a group of type II integral membrane metalloproteases that includes the leucocyte antigens CD10, CD26, CD73, and BP-1. The CD13 glycoprotein has a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane region that functions as a signal peptide, and a large C-terminal extracellular region that contains 11 N-linked glycosylation sites and also O-linked glycosylation. CD13 is a receptor for coronaviruses, RNA viruses that cause respiratory diseases in humans and several species of animals. The binding site on CD 13 for the swine coronavirus TGEV (transmissible gastroenteritis virus) is distinct from the enzymatic site. CD13 is a zinc-binding metalloprotease that plays a role in cell surface antigen presentation by trimming the N-terminal amino acids from MHC Class II-bound peptides.",1

"Publisher Summary Wheezing with respiratory infections is extremely common in early childhood. It is estimated that the prevalence of wheezing during the first five years of life varies from 30–60%. In the majority of children who experience wheezing with respiratory infections, these episodes of wheezing become less frequent as the child grows older. However, determining whether the initial episode of wheezing with a viral respiratory illness is an important factor in the eventual development of asthma is an important question. Although a significant body of information suggests an association between respiratory tract illnesses in early life and the later development of airway dysfunction, this relationship is difficult to establish and indicates the complexity of factors that surround the development of bronchial hyperresponsiveness and eventual expression of asthma. A similarly important issue to resolve is the relationship between respiratory infections and the pathogenesis of airway hyperresponsiveness. It is apparent that viral, not bacterial, upper respiratory infections (URIs) trigger asthma attacks. With the use of more sensitive techniques to identify respiratory viruses, the relationship between respiratory infections, particularly viral URIs, and asthma has become even more convincing and important.",1
"Publisher Summary Infection, in particular by respiratory viruses, plays an important role in triggering exacerbations and has also been implicated in the etiology of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This chapter reviews the epidemiological evidence that implicates infectious pathogens as triggers. The chapter also discusses the mechanisms of interaction between the host-pathogen response and preexisting airway pathology resulting in an exacerbation. Much of the treatment of infective exacerbations for both asthma and COPD is symptomatic, consisting of bronchodilators or supportive in the form of oxygen, and in severe cases it includes noninvasive or invasive ventilatory measures. The current therapy for virus-induced exacerbations of asthma and COPD relies on increased treatment of preexisting disease. Antibiotics are indicated for bacterial infections. The effective use of antiviral agents, particularly for influenza viruses, requires viral diagnosis, commencement of treatment early in the course of an exacerbation, or the targeting of high-risk groups for prophylaxis. Alternative strategies for drug development involve the identification of key factors common to exacerbations induced by a range of different viruses. Increased knowledge of the host–virus interaction can help in designing treatments that can increase virus clearance and minimize immunopathology.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the bacterial pathogens that cause infective exacerbations, trials of antimicrobial therapy, individual antimicrobial agents, and guidelines for their use in the treatment of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The relationship between respiratory tract infection, especially viral infection, and exacerbations of airway diseases is very well established. However, research is required to find new ways to distinguish between the colonization and infective exacerbations of COPD to gain a better understanding of the role of infection in the disease. With advances in molecular biology, the antigenic structures of bacteria and the evaluation of the antibody response to antigens can become the basis for identifying an acute exacerbation of COPD (AECB). Most clinical trials of antibiotics were performed for licensing, and patients with pathogens resistant to different antimicrobials were excluded. Future studies of new antimicrobials should examine clinical efficacy more stringently based on a classification system that would help select patients most likely to benefit from an antibiotic. These studies should also include well-defined prospective economic analyses and quality-of-life assessment to ascertain the cost utility of the antibiotic in question.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter explains the exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and its causes, mechanisms, and treatment approaches. COPD exacerbations are an important cause of the significant morbidity and mortality related to COPD. These COPD exacerbations increase with severity of the disease, and frequent exacerbations impact the patient's quality of life and activities of daily living. These exacerbations are also associated with considerable physiological deterioration and increased airway inflammatory changes caused by a variety of factors such as viruses, bacteria, and some common pollutants. Exacerbation of COPD results in an increase in airflow obstruction, which further increases the load on the respiratory muscles and increases the effort in breathing, thereby leading to respiratory failure in severe cases. Treatment approaches include the use of corticosteroids, antibiotics, inhaled bronchodilator therapy in certain cases, and ventilatory support. Increased patient education about detecting and treating exacerbations early in the natural history of COPD can be significantly beneficial. Following an exacerbation, the patient's condition should be constantly reviewed, giving attention to risk factors and compliance with therapy.",1

"Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on the structural chemistry of membrane alanyl aminopeptidase (mAAP). The early history of mAAP relates to its role as Cys-Gly dipeptidase or cysteinyl-glycinase. It was proposed that this peptidase activity present in apparently purified RNA preparations contributed to polypeptide biosynthesis by acting in reverse in a sequential fashion. mAAP has a broad substrate specificity removing N-terminal amino acids (Xaa-Xbb-) from almost all unsubstituted oligopeptides and from an amide or arylamide. mAAP is a type II integral membrane protein located on the plasma membrane as an ectoenzyme. The pI is approximately 5. mAAP is widely distributed among species and tissues although it is of greatest abundance in brush border membranes of the kidney, in the mucosal cells of the small intestine and in the liver. It is also present in the lung where it is identical to the pI46 type II alveolar epithelial cell antigen and is located on endothelial cells in blood vessels. On polarized epithelial cells, mAAP is localized to the apical domain and is targeted there through an apical sorting signal thought to be located in the catalytic head group region of the protein.",1

"Publisher Summary Vaccines are considered to be one of the most significant medical interventions against infectious diseases. Despite this success, major obstacles remain in developing vaccines for pathogens against which vaccines do not exist or against emerging pathogens and improving suboptimal vaccines. Key elements needed to design effective vaccines include identification of protective antigens against which a robust and durable adaptive response must be generated, compounds that can stimulate the innate immune responses, and optimal delivery systems which carry and dispense the antigenic and immuno stimulatory cargo to the appropriate cells of the immune system. The mechanistic understanding and the tools to manipulate this system are growing and it is likely that novel immune potentiators and delivery systems can make a significant impact on vaccine development in the near future. Thus, selecting the optimal platforms for development and identifying the key cellular and molecular targets of the innate immune system can trigger the safest and most effective immune responses against diverse pathogens which should be the long-term goal.",1

"Publisher Summary Communication is an essential part of life in science. It is about explaining the importance of work to grant panels, funding agencies, and project reviewers; publishing research; and informing and educating the public. It is also involved in building relationships, bringing and keeping teams together, and becoming recognized. This chapter highlights the essentials of communication. The ability to communicate effectively is not an innate quality that one either does or does not possess. It is a set of skills that can be learned and developed, regardless of one's starting point. While some people seem more naturally adept than others, through conscious effort, practice, and constructive feedback, everyone can improve. Being able to speak knowledgeably and fluently is important for effective communication, especially at the beginning of any conversation or presentation because it sets the tone, and can positively influence self-confidence. An important strategy for increasing preparedness and effectiveness as a communicator is to commit to the continual development of skills. Another way to influence how to communicate successfully is to understand the audience—the “receivers” of the message—and to use the information to make the best “connection.”",1

"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the frequently occurring pitfalls in hospital preparedness and response. Significant systemic constraints make hospitals reluctant partners in preparedness and generate ineffective responses. Such a condition has been highlighted by the antiterrorism training and preparedness programs over the past few years. The results of numerous such exercises and actual responses across the United States indicate a list of pitfalls—such as communications, hospital security, and hospital staff management—which are related to the inherent system limitations that hinder the effective disaster operations in hospitals. Hospitals are required to have and exercise emergency-preparedness plans. An all-hazard approach can allow for preparedness and a measured, flexible response to a variety of potential incidents. Generally, plans may contain annexes for specific hazards, but an all-hazard plan should obviate a separate plan for each hazard—for example, an earthquake plan and a terrorism plan.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter reviews the response to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which can serve as a prototype for combating acts of bioterrorism, in the setting of a Hong Kong acute-care hospital. After overcoming the onslaught of SARS, the Hong Kong community has become aware that emerging infections can occur at any time. This is reinforced by the recent avian influenza outbreaks, which act as a reminder of this looming threat. Hospitals have to evaluate their levels of preparedness against bioterrorism, which can simulate infectious disease outbreaks. The priority areas for improvement include community involvement, staff education, improved information technology, disease surveillance, and additional equipment and staff. Multidimensional and flexible-response plans require strong leadership and clear directions to be effective, and such plans must also consider human frailties during great stress, when every resource is stretched to its utmost limit. The chapter concludes by discussing the various infection-control measures implemented in Hong Kong.",1

"Publisher Summary This chapter introduces basic concepts of virology and exemplifies the usage of current technology for identifying and tracking viral pathogens. Virus structure, lifestyle, replication strategies, classication, the varied modes of transmission, infection, and disease manifestations are focussed upon in the chapter. Viruses are extremely simple “life” forms without metabolic capacity, organelles, translational machinery, or autonomous replicative potential; the essential elements of a virus are consequently minimal. A virus enters the host through any opportunistic opening of the body—; such as minute breaks in the skin barrier or mucosal linings of the eye, nose, etc. Antibodies produced during an infection often have the ability to bind the virus and reduce infectivity. An immediate question to solve during a virus outbreak is the mechanism by which the virus spreads. Viruses frequently infect animal or insect vectors that serve to pass the virus to humans. By identifying the virus through sequence analysis, a hypothetical reservoir can be predicted by the placement of the sequence on the phylogenetic tree‥ The varied modes of transmission, infection, and disease manifestations as they relate to the different diagnostic methods for virus identification are highlighted. Examples of naturally emerging viruses; such as Sin Nombre, Nipah, West Nile conclude the chapter. New technologies that allow the creation of manmade or “engineered” viruses, new frontiers in viral diagnostics, and a few thoughts on the future of virology are also presented. The global eradication of smallpox ranks as one of humankind's greatest accomplishments yet many viral challenges remain. HIV, hepatitis B and C, influenza, dengue, rotavirus, and many other viral diseases continue to affect tens of millions.",1
"Publisher Summary Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states or events in specied populations and the application of this study to control health problems. It reflects that diseases are not randomly distributed in the population and that individuals have certain characteristics that predispose to, or protect against, a variety of different diseases. Disease is the result of an epidemiological triad, where disease results from the interaction of: the human host, an infectious agent or toxin, and the environment that promotes the exposure. This chapter focuses on the use of epidemiology to identify the source of diseases caused by microorganisms or toxins. Microorganisms are very efficient at infecting humans, using a number of different strategies and mechanisms. The deliberate dissemination of a biological agent by many of these mechanisms presents the latest challenge to public health. It requires a careful epidemiologic investigation to determine whether an outbreak of infectious disease is because of the intentional release of an agent, or is naturally occurring. A number of molecular techniques have been developed for sub typing bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa, which will facilitate this investigation as well as identify clusters of related microorganisms.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter presents the elements of the host response in a simplified fashion. Microbial forensics aims at identifying: the biological agent, its source, and the individuals responsible for a biothreat event. Analytic approaches differ when the suspected biothreat agent is encountered in a container or the environment, as opposed to a human or an animal. However, once the microbe or its toxin is in the living host, all the preceding items except the microbial nucleic acid cannot be analyzed. Nevertheless, the host response to the biological agent is available for analysis. The host response to a foreign substance is often a well orchestrated series of events designed to protect the individual from any harm. Modern techniques help to elucidate the pathways and components of the host response. Similar to a live microbe, vaccines can also provoke an antibody response. A vaccine can compose of: a live or attenuated microbe, a whole nonproliferating microbe, or an antigenic part of the microbe. Regardless, the intent of the vaccine is to produce protection, often by protective antibodies. It is likely that the future understanding of the immune system and evolving technologies; such as microarrays will enhance analytic power.",1

"Publisher Summary This chapter examines nuclear programming of somatic cells by cell hybridization with pluripotential stem cells. This chapter describes a practical procedure for electrofusion to produce hybrid cells between pluripotential stem cells and committed somatic cells without the use of virus or chemicals to mediate the fusion. One is required to culture exponentially growing ES cells on the inactivated PEFs with changes of culture medium once or twice a day. Carry out subculturing of the ES cells every 2 days by a 1:4 split. Trypsinize ES cells and remove excess trypsin quickly. Add 3 ml of ES medium to inactivate the trypsin and dissociate the cells into a single-cell suspension by gentle pipetting. Plate them on a new gelatin-coated 60-mm culture dish. Use the automatic operation switch to initiate AC followed by DC. AC is utilized to induce an inhomogeneous or divergent electric field, resulting in cell alignment and pearl chain formation.",1
"Publisher Summary Distinct pathways of membrane glycoprotein transport exist in polarized epithelial cell monolayers, differing in their sensitivity to monensin, a sodium ionophore. Monensin blocks the transport of secretory and membrane glycoproteins at the level of the Golgi complex, which appears dilated as an effect of the drug. Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein continues to be transported to the surface of monensin-treated cells, is cleaved into HA1 and HA2 and is incorporated into budding influenza virus particles. On the other hand, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) glycoprotein appears to accumulate in the membranes of the dilated Golgi apparatus of monensin-treated cells. This chapter discusses the effects of monensin on the kinetics of transport of viral membrane glycoproteins to the cell surface. It also discusses the effect of the ionophore on the directional transport of viral glycoproteins in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells doubly-infected with influenza virus and VSV and on the replication of viruses that are assembled at intracellular membranes.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the production systems of adenoviral vectors. Particular attention is paid to the generation and use of complementation cell lines that carry the El genes and emphasizes on the PER.C6 cell line, which was developed to prevent generation of replication-competent adenovirus (RCA) during propagation of El-deleted adenoviral vectors. Further, safety issues with respect to the use of the cell line for making clinical grade material are also addressed in this chapter. The PER.C6 cell line is the best substrate for the production of adenoviral vectors for gene therapy or vaccines. PER.C6 permits extensive analysis for adventitial agents and other safety concerns and thus is less hazardous than short-lived primary cell cultures for which testing must be repeated for each newly established culture.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the utility and safety of xenogenic vectors for vaccination or gene delivery. The properties and behavior of these vectors in heterologous situations are also discussed. Ideally, vectors for gene transfer into human cells should be capable of transgene expression without replication or detrimental expression of viral genes. Infection of human cell lines with intact xenogenic adenoviruses established the principle that these viruses are replication defective at the inputs tested, although the molecular basis for defective replication is not understood. Most work with xenogenic vectors is still firmly based in the laboratory and while this is appropriate to demonstrate the utility of a vector the amount of work required for eventual exploitation of a vector in the clinic should not be underestimated. Understanding the biology of these vectors will ultimately lead to an increased choice of gene delivery vectors, providing more options in therapeutic strategy and design.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter describes the agency requirements and guidelines for drug development of adenoviral-containing products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) assessment of safety and ultimately effectiveness of adenovirus containing products involves thorough evaluation of the information contained in the Investigational New Drug Application (IND), and any supporting information cross-referenced to another IND or drug master file. Many factors contribute to development of FDA recommendations and requirements for characterization of adenovirus vectors. The FDA receives input and feedback from a variety of sources in formulating recommendations regarding adenovirus manufacturing and characterization. The recommendations may change with advances in technology and through accumulating experience. FDA considers the potential risks and benefits of each vector product and each proposed clinical trial when making its recommendations. The FDA is cognizant of the need for flexibility in its recommendations and will consider many factors, including the intended target population, the seriousness of the disease under study, the potential benefits and risks from the investigational product, when advising sponsors about their adenovirus development program.",1
"Publisher Summary Diseases caused by microbial infections are present throughout human evolution. Large proportions are the result of virus infections. A commonly cited example of resurgent or recurrent disease is the yearly appearance of new antigenically different influenza viruses. These new variants are able to evoke disease in their host while causing the centuries-old symptoms of influenza. However, conventional virological techniques have failed to identify the agent, even though evidence suggested non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH) is caused by a blood-borne, small enveloped virus, readily transmissible to chimpanzees. Modern molecular biology techniques are used to identify completely new viruses. These viruses can be associated with a new disease or associated with a well-characterized disease present in humans for many years. In identifying an emerging virus, one is often presented with epidemiological data and clinical specimens that have no reactivity with diagnostic reagents available for known pathogens. The primary aim therefore is to identify any new infectious agent and build a body of data to support the existence of a causal link between organism and disease.",1

"Publisher Summary The cell surface is covered with protein molecules that are held in the membrane by hydrophobic transmembrane segments or glycosyl–phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. Antigens found on cell surfaces comprise not only those encoded by the cell itself but also the products of intracellular parasites. Soluble ligands may be bound to receptor structures on the cell membrane or lectin-like molecules bound to cell-surface carbohydrate structures. The molecules that form an integral part of the cell surface may be proteins, glycoproteins, or glycolipids. They subserve one of three major functions: adhesion, antigen recognition, or receptors for soluble mediators. However, many cell-surface molecules possess more than one function—for example, molecules involved in cell–cell or cell–extracellular matrix adhesion can also themselves be involved in signal transduction. The cell-surface antigens of leukocytes have been intensively studied because of ease of access to this cellular compartment.",1

"Publisher Summary RNA's unprecedented ability to act both as a template for information storage and as an enzymatic molecule has led to the proposal that primitive living systems were based on RNA, with protein synthesis and DNA templates for information storage added later. This chapter reviews the current knowledge about RNA rearrangement and recombination in viruses, and cites evidence for various mechanisms catalyzing these events. RNA recombination can occur in a spontaneous manner, and such a potential, even at low frequency, would expand opportunities for RNA conjunction. The chapter also outlines the significance of work on viroid-like pathogens, circular RNA replication, and their potential relation to early RNA; and relates the early emergence of RNA mosaics to developments leading to today's DNA-based systems of viral gene expression.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter argues that the vast majority of genetic changes or mutations fixed by RNA viruses are essentially neutral or nearly neutral in character. In molecular evolution one of the remarkable observations has been the uniformity of the molecular clock. An analysis of proteins derived from complete potyvirus genomes, positive-stranded RNA viruses, yielded highly significant linear relationships. These analyses indicate that viral protein diversification is essentially a smooth process, the major parameter being the nature of the protein more than the ecological niche it finds itself in. Synonymous changes are invariably more frequent than nonsynonymous changes. Positive selection exploits a small proportion of genetic variants, while functional sequence space is sufficiently dense, allowing viable solutions to be found. Although evolution has connotations of change, what has always counted is natural selection or adaptation. It is the only force for the genesis of a novel replicon.",1
"Publisher Summary The discovery of viruses heralded an exciting new era for research in the medical and biological sciences. It has been realized that the cellular receptor guiding a virus to a target cell cannot be the sole determinant of a virus's pathogenic potential. Comparative analyses of the structures of genomes and their products have placed the picornaviruses into a large “picorna-like” virus family, in which they occupy a prominent place. Most human picornavirus infections are self-limiting, yet the enormously high rate of picornavirus infections in the human population can lead to a significant incidence of disease complications that may be permanently debilitating or even fatal. Picornaviruses employ one of the simplest imaginable genetic systems: they consist of single-stranded RNA that encodes only a single multidomain polypeptide, the polyprotein. The RNA is packaged into a small, rigid, naked, and icosahedral virion whose proteins are unmodified except for a myristate at the N-termini of VP4. The RNA itself does not contain modified bases. The key to ultimately understanding picornaviruses may be to rationalize the huge amount of information about these viruses from the perspective of evolution. It is possible that the replicative apparatus of picornaviruses originated in the precellular world and was subsequently refined in the course of thousands of generations in a slowly evolving environment. Picornaviruses cultivated the art of adaptation, which has allowed them to “jump” into new niches offered in the biological world.",1

"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the basic principles of molecular biology regarding genome science and describes the major types of data involved in genome projects, including technologies for collecting them. Genome science is heavily driven by new technological advances that allow for rapid and inexpensive collection of various types of data. The emergence of genomic science has not simply provided a rich set of tools and data for studying molecular biology. It has been the catalyst for an astounding burst of interdisciplinary research, and it has challenged long-established hierarchies found in most institutions of higher learning. The next generation of biologists needs to be as comfortable at a computer workstation as they are at the lab bench. Recognizing this fact, many universities have already reorganized their departments and their curricula to accommodate the demands of genomic science.The chapter discusses practical applications and uses of genomic data. For example, in the foreseeable future, are gene therapies that can repair genetic defects.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter provides an overview of the metabolism of bradykinin (BK) by peptidases in health and disease. The enzymatic breakdown of kinins affects the duration of their biological actions as the plasma half-life of intravenously injected BK is in the range of seconds. Kinins are cleaved in vitro and in vivo by enzymes that belong to families, such as zinc-metallopeptidases, astacin-like metallopeptidases, and catheptic enzymes. Vane noted the importance of the pulmonary circulation in the metabolism of vasoactive substances, such as BK as well as angiotensin 1 and 5- hydroxytryptamine. It is clear after decades of research that angiotensin 1-converting enzyme (ACE) on the vascular endothelial cell surface is the most important inactivator of blood-borne BK. BK may act primarily in an autocrine and paracrine fashion, establishing the importance of local regulation of its activity by enzymes on cell surfaces. Thus, the assortment of other enzymes that can inactivate BK is important in a variety of physiological and pathological situations. Most physiological systems have redundant pathways of metabolism so that the abolishment of one pathway is compensated for by the presence of others. This is demonstrated by the pharmacological inhibition of ACE in hypertension.",1

"Publisher Summary Viral taxonomists have developed a system of classification and nomenclature that embraces all viruses. From the operational point of view, viruses are divided into those that affect vertebrate animals, insects, plants, and bacteria. The chapter discusses the viruses of vertebrate animals, although some of these viruses, the arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses), also replicate in insects or other arthropods. Several hundred species of viruses have been recovered from humans, who are the best-studied vertebrate hosts and new ones are still occasionally discovered. Somewhat fewer have been recovered from each of the common species of farm and companion animals and from the commonly used laboratory animals. To simplify the study of this vast number of infectious agents, these are sorted into groups that share certain common properties. The most important criteria for classification are the physical and chemical characteristics of the virion and the mode of replication of the virus. The chapter explains a formal viral taxonomy, which is based on these criteria.",1
"Publisher Summary Although some viruses can infect and cause disease in many species, many are host specific. Within a susceptible host species, there is often a striking difference between individual animals in their levels of resistance. Within susceptible species, resistance varies not only with the genetic constitution of the host but also with age, nutritional status, stress, and many other factors. These genetic and physiological factors determine what is called the nonspecific or innate resistance of the host, in contrast to the immunologically specific resistance that results from the operation of the immune response. Genetic differences in susceptibility are most obvious when different animal species are compared. Common viral infections often tend to be less pathogenic in their natural host species than in certain exotic or introduced species. Immunological responsiveness to particular antigens differs greatly from one strain of mouse to another, being under the control of specific immune response (Ir) genes. There are many of these genes, most of them situated in the region known as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC).",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the ways in which viral replication damages tissues and organs and the ways in which the body's own responses may cause damage. It presents examples illustrating the pathogenesis of four basic kinds of acute viral infection: respiratory, intestinal, generalized, and neurological. As the immune system plays a key role in protection against infections, viral damage to its components can exacerbate the severity of disease or predispose to superinfection with other viral or nonviral agents. Both specific acquired immunodeficiency and generalized immunosuppression can occur in viral infections. The immune response to viral infection may itself frequently contribute to the pathology of the disease. Inflammation with accompanying cellular infiltration is a regular feature of viral infection. Such common signs as erythema, edema, and enlargement of lymph nodes have an immunological basis. There are viral diseases in which the cardinal manifestations are caused by the body's immune response. Immunopathological (hypersensitivity) reactions are traditionally classified into types 1, 2, 3, and 4. For most viral infections, it is not known whether immunopathological effects make a significant contribution to disease and if so then as to which of the four classical hypersensitivity reactions is implicated. It is instructive to speculate about the possible involvement of different kinds of hypersensitivity reactions in viral diseases.",1
"Publisher Summary Coronaviruses are ssRNA viruses that infect a wide range of mammalian and avian species; they are important causes of respiratory and enteric disease, encephalomyelitis, hepatitis, serositis, and vasculitis in domestic animals. In humans, coronaviruses are one of several groups of viruses that cause the common cold. The prototype of the family, avian infectious brochitis virus, is one of the most infectious of all viruses and causes an acute respiratory disease, which in young chicks can cause very high mortality. Outbreaks can be explosive, involving nearly every bird in the flock at about the same time, because of respiratory transmission and a very short incubation period. In many ways, transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine and mouse hepatitis virus behave similarly, affecting young animals most severely, spreading very quickly to all animals at risk, and causing major economic losses before control strategies can be put into place. The strategy of expression of the coronavirus genome is unique. The input virion RNA molecule is translated directly, one of the products being an RNA polymerase that then transcribes a full-length (—) sense copy RNA, from which in turn is transcribed a 3′-coterminal nested set of subgenomic mRNAs. The nested set comprises six overlapping species of mRNAs that extend for different lengths from a common 3′ terminus. Only the unique sequence toward the 5′ end, which is not shared with the next smallest mRNA in the nested set, is translated, each product, therefore, being a unique protein.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter presents tables that list the most important diseases and syndromes caused by viruses in each domestic animal species with their etiological associations. This listing is neither meant to substitute for a textbook of veterinary medicine or infectious diseases nor is it intended to be used for differential diagnosis, where viral and other etiologies must be considered together. Such a tabulation inevitably involves oversimplification, but page numbers have been provided to direct the reader to appropriate pages for detailed coverage of each of these viral infections. In these tables, each disease is ascribed to a measure of its importance as viewed from the perspective of veterinary medicine in countries with modern agricultural practices. There is an arbitrary element in relation to the group of diseases to which certain infections are allocated. For example, most generalized skin diseases result from generalized blood-borne infection but they have been listed as skin diseases. Where viruses cause generalized signs and also signs of particular importance in some system or in the newborn, they have been entered in both categories.",1

"ABSTRACT The murine coronavirus JHM induces in weanling rats different types of central nervous diseases ranging from an acute panencephalitis to a late demyelinating encephalomyelitis. The occurrence and rate of these different disease types is associated with the virus variant used for inoculation.

The relationship of these coronaviruses to JHM was investigated by cross neutralization and oligonucleotide maps of their genomic RNA.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses three virus infections affecting the digestive system of mice and their properties: (1) epizootic diarrhea of infant mice (EDIM), (2) reovirus 3 infection, and (3) murine hepatitis virus infection (MHV). All three infections may cause serious, debilitating, and sometimes fatal diarrheal disease in nursling and weanling mice. Mice of all ages can be infected by the EDIM virus but overt disease is restricted to animals up to about 12–13 days of age at the time of first exposure. The EDIM virus is worldwide in distribution. Its prevalence is difficult to estimate because serologic tests have not been readily available, and it is not customary to sacrifice animals for the purpose of examining the appearance of their intestinal tract or for electron microscopic visualization of fecal contents. The acute disease of reovirus 3 infection affects mainly sucklings and weanlings, whereas the chronic disease is encountered in animals over 28 days of age. The MHV virus, on the other hand, has been found to affect cotton rats, rats, and hamsters.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses known or potential zoonotic agents and the disease manifestations produced in man by exposure to infected mice. It also discusses other health hazards that may be encountered when working with mice, such as bites and allergies. Selected transmission of human infectious agents to mice is also briefly described in the chapter. Of the many latent viruses present in the mouse, only the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCM) naturally infects man. A review of the literature attests to the ease with which the LCM can be transmitted from animals to man. Although its expression can vary greatly, the LCM virus infection appears most frequently as a mild influenza-like syndrome, with or without apparent involvement of the central nervous system. In one epidemic of the non-meningitic LCM virus infection caused by exposure to infected hamsters, an influenza-like illness was described with typical symptoms of retro-orbital headache, severe myalgia, malaise, anorexia, and aching pain in the chest. A variety of rodent hosts are included in the transmission cycle of the rickettsial disease in nature. The house mouse is the natural host of Rickettsia akari, which is the causative agent of rickettsialpox and a member of the spotted fever group of rickettsiae. Another rickettsial disease—murine typhus or endemic typhus—is transmitted to man by rat fleas; rats and mice are its natural reservoirs. Rickettsia mooseri—the causative agent—has not been isolated from natural infections in laboratory mice. Clinical signs, diagnosis, and control in man are similar to those described for rickettsialpox.",1

"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the psychosocial influences on immunity and infectious disease in humans. There is evidence for the plausibility of psychosocial influences on infectious disease in humans as well as evidence for a role of stress in determining susceptibility for a small number of infectious agents. Little is known about the characteristics of psychosocial factors that increase or decrease risk of disease onset and progression and of the nature of behavioral, endocrine, and immune changes that are responsible for psychosocial-induced changes in disease risk. Until there is more empirical evidence for specific mechanisms linking psychosocial factors to infectious disease, there would be little real understanding of the extent to which evidence deriving from present work generalizes to other disease models. It is likely that the following years would result in an understanding of the relations between psychosocial factors and immunity, the mechanisms that link psychosocial influence to immune change, and the range of immune function that is subject to alteration.",1

"Publisher Summary This chapter provides an overview of the human and animal viruses. Viruses held to a low number of passages in animals or cell cultures represent a viral population that is similar to that found in nature, and freezing these pools guards against genetic mutations that occur during subsequent passage. Aliquots of viral stocks frozen at a designated passage level can then be used for multiple and repeatable experiments with the same viral population. Furthermore, it is important that consistency should be maintained during the production of viral vaccines; new lots of final product are prepared with frozen viral seed stocks that consistently reproduce the desired immunogenic and attenuation characteristics. To better appreciate the requirements for freezing and freeze drying of human and animal viruses, some consideration is given to understanding the structural and functional organization of this diverse group of microorganisms. The classification of viruses is based on morphological and physiochemical properties. Thus, viruses are divided into those with DNA or RNA genomes and subdivided into families based on size and structural properties. Several methods for preservation of viruses are included in the chapter.",1

"Publisher Summary Rabies in terrestrial animals, primarily carnivores, is caused by the classic genotype 1 rabies virus. Even though the widespread vaccination of domestic dogs has been the one most effective factor in the reduction of human rabies, the number of human deaths worldwide is greater than that of the combined deaths from polio, meningococcal meningitis, Japanese encephalitis, yellow fever, severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenze (bird flu).Tools are available in highly efficacious and safe animal and human vaccines. Multiple factors can, however, prevent their use effectively in many areas of the world. For several decades, virtually all rabies nerve tissue origin (NTO) vaccines were inactivated with phenol using the method described by Semple. The NTO vaccines currently in use for mass vaccination campaigns in Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean are primarily produced from rabies virus-infected suckling mouse brains or lamb brains. These vaccines are shown to be effective in campaigns. However, NTO-killed vaccines for dogs and other animals have often, in the past, resulted in post-vaccinal nervous system reactions that could result in the death of the vaccinated animals.",1

"Dramatic improvements in the control of infectious diseases in developed countries owing to socioeconomic changes, vaccines, and antibiotics during the first seven decades of the 20th century led to the mistakened concept that infectious diseases would no longer be a concern. Since the declaration of victory in the war against infectious diseases in 1967, approximately 50 new disease agents have been identified. Nearly every type of etiologic agent and clinical manifestation have been involved including acute respiratory infections (e.g., H5N1 influenza A, SARS, hantaviral cardiopulmonary syndrome, and Legionnaires’ disease), central nervous system involvement (e.g., West Nile encephalitis, Nipah virus encephalitis, and prion diseases), enteric infections (e.g., Helicobacter pylori gastric and duodenal diseases, cryptosporidiosis, microsporidioses, and Shiga toxin diseases), systemic bacterial diseases (e.g., Lyme disease, six new rickettsioses, three new human ehrlichioses, bartonelloses, and staphylococcal and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome), viral hemorrhagic fevers (e.g., Marburg, Ebola, Lassa, Bolivian, Argentine, and Venezuelan hemorrhagic fevers), human retroviral infections (e.g., HIV1 and 2 and HTLV-I and II), new human herpesviruses (HHV6, HHV7, and HHV8), and the viral agents of hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E. There are the reciprocal threats that a bioterror agent (e.g., smallpox virus) could cause a newly emerging infectious disease (EID) and that an agent of emerging infections (e.g., SARS-coronavirus or Rift Valley fever virus) could be disseminated by terrorists. Vaccines offer a critically important potential countermeasure against the effects of these and future EIDs. An aggressive approach to developing prototype vaccines against each new class of etiologic agent must be driven by public health initiatives because commercial interests will not undertake these projects. The microbe must be completely characterized biologically, molecularly, and genetically. An accurate animal model of the human infectious disease should be developed. The mechanisms of vaccine-induced protective immunity must be elucidated and the antigens that stimulate these mechanisms of protective immune memory identified. Preclinical testing of vaccine candidates should then be completed in the animal models. It would be most effective if subunit vaccine platforms were developed in which new antigen cassettes could be inserted and FDA approval obtained using one or more prototypes. Experience in manufacturing and a track record of effectiveness and safety for vaccines against numerous emerging infectious agents could be achieved for veterinary diseases caused by organisms that also cause emerging human infections (e.g., West Nile virus and ehrlichioses). In the United States, these approaches are driven currently by individual investigator initiative in pursuing the scientific questions through grants from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Progress occurs, but not at the desired level. An emerging infection with high transmissibility (e.g., R o=10) and a case-fatality rate of 15% would cause global devastating effects at a level on the order of magnitude of a nuclear war. Our efforts to prepare for EIDs fall far short of nuclear attack preparedness during the Cold War.",1
"The risk posed by viruses as biological threat agents is discussed primarily from a public health perspective, with the potential occurrence of significant morbidity and mortality as a result of infection via natural or intentional exposure. Parameters of risk associated with the spectrum of viruses considered as biological threat agents are discussed, to include examples of intentional use. In consideration of the threat posed by viruses, mitigating illness and preventing death are the principal goals of medical countermeasure development efforts. The existence of safe and efficacious vaccines is critical to establishing a robust posture of preparedness to address the spectrum of viral threat agents.",1
"Traditional vaccine development platforms such as live-attenuated virus, killed virus, or recombinant subunit-based vaccines are often effective in eliciting long-term immunity to a number of infectious human pathogens. However, for many human pathogens, vaccine platforms such as these are unsuitable for human use due to safety concerns, poor efficacy, or simple impracticality. As a result, much work has focused on the use of recombinant virus vectors as a means for vaccination against human pathogens. Viral vectors can express foreign proteins at high levels in host cells, resulting in strong, long-lasting immune responses against the target proteins. This chapter describes the use of virus vectors in the context of vaccination against human pathogens. Various vector platforms are discussed, compared, and contrasted.",1
"Continued improvements in vaccination technologies have led to remarkable progress in the control of human infectious diseases. Our fundamental view of the nature of a vaccine was changed with the discovery of DNA immunization in the early 1990s when it was determined that the genetic material that encodes for antigens, rather than the actual antigens themselves, can be effective in eliciting an immune response. Given the ever increasing threat of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases and a renewed concern regarding the use of biological agents for bioterrorism purposes, the opportunities that DNA vaccine technology provides could not have come at a more critical time in history. Since its inception, DNA vaccination technology has undergone significant advancements and many candidate human vaccine formulations have already been developed. Improved modes of administration, the use of codon and antigen gene optimization, and the implementation of vaccination DNA prime/boost regimens have led to the quick progression of DNA vaccines from research laboratory benches to human clinical trials. Significant progress has been made in developing DNA vaccines against various biodefense and emerging infectious disease targets, such as HIV-1, influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Ebola, the viral encephalitides, anthrax, plague, and botulism, among others with some already moving into early phase clinical trials with promising results. Having the ability to respond to a potential bioterrorism threat or to some other emerging infectious disease outbreak is crucial and the advancements associated with DNA vaccination technology will allow us to do so in a prompt and rational matter.",1
"The world was struck by surprise when a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic started in 2003 in China. This disease had never been observed in man before; the SARS-Coronavirus causing the disease was unknown. With the uncertainty about the future impact of this epidemic, an important international collaboration started spontaneously sharing scientific knowledge and reagents. Resources became quickly available, and public and private efforts were undertaken to develop rapidly a vaccine. We will discuss here the importance of the international collaboration and the availability of funding. Moreover, we will review the most important and challenging steps during the industrial development of the SARS vaccine highlighting the difficulties in terms of safety working with such a highly pathogenic, unknown virus. We will emphasize the industrial perspectives on inactivation and decontamination experiments, the selection of the most promising vaccine candidate, the production process and the choice and use of animal models in such a pressing and difficult situation. Finally, we will briefly review the unique regulatory environment created during this period for the development of a SARS vaccine.",1
"The development of safe and effective vaccines for the prevention and control of emerging and neglected infectious diseases is an international priority, as is the development of similar control measures for bioterrorist threats. International standards have been established to ensure the protection of human subjects and the scientific integrity of clinical trial study design and data collection. A general overview of the history of the regulatory guidelines and ethical principles underpinning the vaccine development process is provided, with an emphasis on clinical trials conducted in the United States. The contemporary vaccine development process involves sequential assessment of safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy in phase1, 2, and 3 clinical trials. The process is not always linear or straightforward, and adaptive flexible clinical trial designs can increase the likelihood of a successful outcome. Because the efficacy of vaccines for a number of the diseases discussed in this volume cannot be tested directly in humans, alternative approaches have been developed to address this challenge. The major elements of typical clinical trial protocol are discussed, and a checklist of essential documents supporting the trial is provided. As novel vaccine approaches and technologies emerge, the regulatory and ethical considerations will need to be revisited and adapted to respond to the ever-changing landscape.",1
"The majority of vaccines licensed for controlling infectious disease of veterinary species today are based on technology that was introduced by Jenner using live vaccines and Pasteur using killed whole organism vaccines 200 and 100 years ago, respectively, yet this former technology has not stopped several successful vaccination programs from being developed. Much of veterinary vaccinology is driven by the realities that exist in raising production animals or working in veterinary practice, where making a living depends on keeping the animals healthy, because it is an industry where vaccines are like insurance policies—protection from events that one hopes never happen. For example, the USDA recognizes these varying levels of protection in the way that they allow label claims: (1) “aids in disease control,” (2) “for the prevention of disease,” and (3) “for the prevention of infection.” Additionally there may be indirect protection, or herd immunity, that results from vaccination of sufficient numbers of animals in a given population resulting in the reduction of the ability of a disease to transmit through the vaccinated individuals. The perception that vaccines provide sterilizing immunity, where the disease agent does not establish an infection, while widely held, is generally unfounded and largely unrealistic. Recent advances, especially in the last 15 years in genomics, proteomics, biotechnology, immunology, pathogenesis, and vaccine formulation and delivery have dramatically changed our approach to vaccine development. When used optimally, vaccines have been shown to prevent disease, reduce the need for pharmaceutical intervention, and improve the health and welfare of animals, and indirectly people as well. The challenge in developing an optimal vaccination program is in dealing with the great diversity that exists within the animal world, and as such there probably is no single optimal program for all occasions. While there is no magic solution to optimizing vaccination programs for animals, nonetheless, a solid understanding of the animal’s innate and environmental risk factors as well as the variables such as stress will enable the development of tailored vaccination schedules that best meets the needs of the animal. The use of vaccines in animal health is not restricted to the protection of morbidity and mortality of the animal hosts themselves, but they are regularly employed as key elements in public health programs. When appropriate biopreparedness, management modeling strategies, and contingency plans of the future are linked with (1) protective DIVA vaccines against zoonoses, (2) effective predictive modeling, and (3) deployable implementation policies, control, and prevention of serious zoonotic diseases of man and animals will become more achievable at local, state, and national levels.",1
"Measles is a highly contagious disease characterized by a prodromal illness of fever, cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis followed by the appearance of a generalized maculopapular rash. Measles virus is a nonsegmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus and a member of the Morbillivirus genus in the family of Paramyxoviridae. Although RNA viruses have high mutation rates, measles virus is an antigenically monotypic virus and the surface proteins responsible for inducing protective immunity have retained their antigenic structure. The public health significance is that measles vaccines developed decades ago from a single measles virus strain remain protective worldwide. Prior to the development and widespread use of measles vaccine, 30 million cases of measles were estimated to occur each year, resulting in more than 1 million deaths. Several live, attenuated measles vaccines are available, either as single-antigen vaccines or in combination with rubella and mumps vaccines (MR and MMR vaccines). Most of the currently used measles vaccines were derived from the Edmonston strain of measles virus that was isolated by Enders and Peebles in 1954. Measles vaccines are recommended for all susceptible children and adults for whom the vaccine is not contraindicated. Despite progress in reducing measles mortality, measles remains a major cause of vaccine-preventable death and an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children, particularly sub-Saharan Africa and in Asia. The ideal measles vaccine would be inexpensive, safe, heat-stable, immunogenic in neonates or very young infants, and administered as a single dose without needle or syringe. A number of vaccine candidates with some of these characteristics are undergoing preclinical studies, including DNA vaccines and various viral and bacterial vectored vaccines. The high infectivity of measles virus is a characteristic suitable to a biothreat agent. However, increasingly high levels of measles vaccination coverage throughout the world as part of accelerated measles control efforts would protect many from the deliberate use of measles virus as a biothreat agent. Genetic engineering of a measles virus strain that was not neutralized by antibodies induced by the current attenuated measles vaccines would likely have reduced infectivity, as suggested by the fact that wild-type measles viruses have not mutated to alter their neutralizing epitopes. Measles virus meets many of the biological criteria for disease eradication. Measles virus has no nonhuman reservoir, can be accurately diagnosed, and measles vaccination is a highly effective intervention. Where measles virus differs from smallpox and polio viruses is that it is more highly infectious, necessitating higher levels of population immunity to interrupt transmission. It remains unclear whether the threat from bioterrorism precludes stopping measles vaccination after eradication, but provision of a second opportunity for measles vaccination likely could be stopped following eradication.",1
"Five years after the first severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, several candidate SARS-coronavirus (CoV) vaccines are at various stages of preclinical and clinical development. Based on the observation that SARSCoV infection is efficiently controlled upon passive transfer of antibodies directed against the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV, vaccines containing the S protein have been formulated. Animals immunized with inactivated whole virus vaccines or live-recombinant vaccines expressing the SARS-CoV S protein (e.g., using rabies virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, bovine parainfluenza virus type 3, adenovirus, or attenuated vaccinia virus MVA as a vector), as well as mice immunized with DNA vaccines expressing the S protein gene all developed neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV and were protected against SARS-CoV challenge. Although much effort has been focused on developing a SARS vaccine, the commercial viability of such a vaccine for SARS-CoV will ultimately depend on whether the virus re-emerges in the near future. This vaccine should induce highly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies to protect against newly emerging viruses related to SARS-CoV and protect both the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract in the absence of significant side effects. Given the fact that in the previous outbreak mainly the elderly succumbed to the infection, special attention should be given to vaccines that are able to efficiently protect aged individuals.",1

"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the pathogenesis and progression of infectious diseases. Agricultural and industrial development has resulted in the increased density of humans living in close proximity to each other. This lifestyle change from more rural existence has brought humans in closer proximity to wild animals that harbor potential future human pathogens. Most diseases are transmitted by insect vectors. Molecular diagnostic tests can be divided into two primary groups. The first are tests designed to detect the presence of mutations in the human genome that are associated with specific diseases. These tests need to be performed only once in a specific individual’s lifetime. The second group of molecular diagnostic assays is designed to detect infectious agents or the recurrence of a mutation specifically associated with a tumor the patient has had in the past. Bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic infections can be eradicated and recur at a time in the future requiring repetition of the same molecular assay for detection. Minimal residual disease detection refers to the analysis of tissue/cells in a patient previously diagnosed with a malignancy to evaluate if therapy was completed successfully or if rare malignant cells are present.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the molecular detection of multiple respiratory viruses. Respiratory infections are very common. They are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality and are costly in terms of lost time from work, inappropriate use of antibiotics, and lengthy hospital stays. Laboratory detection of causative agents can influence treatment and allow appropriate infection control measures, potentially saving time and money, promoting quicker recovery for the patient, and lowering the risk of nosocomial transmission of the organism. Molecular testing may be the most sensitive method of detecting respiratory viruses. These methods have been shown to detect multiple viruses in a single sample more often than any of the other methods described and, in addition, can detect viruses that are difficult or impossible to grow. The detection of nonviable organisms may provide additional insight into disease but provides its own challenges in terms of determining clinical significance of positive results. Like many areas of clinical medicine and microbiology, the increasing use of molecular diagnostics for detection of respiratory viruses raises many new questions for the laboratory and the clinical diagnostician, but also promises many benefits as these methods become increasingly available for routine use.",1

"Publisher Summary This chapter attempts to provide an overview of the important aspects of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) experimental biology while emphasizing the virus as a naturally occurring mouse pathogen. Even this is complicated, as it is impossible to generalize with this virus, due to marked differences in the biologic behavior of the myriad virus strains, plus the marked effects of a large number of host factors. It is now known that the MHV group is represented by numerous variants that are constantly mutating, and that these viruses can be biologically separated into respiratory (polytropic) MHVs and enterotropic MHVs, with distinctly different patterns of tissue tropism. This dichotomy is emphasized for discussion, but biology is never absolute. Many of the early MHV isolations are made as a result of contamination of biological materials that correlated with their polytropic biologic behavior. Their stated tropisms frequently were the result of the investigators' research interests and many have therefore been subjected to selective passage that favors a particular tissue tropism. All MHV isolates are related genetically and antigenically, but isolates can be differentiated by genetic sequencing, cross-serum neutralization, or with monoclonal antibodies. Genetic and antigenic relationships are not predictive of biologic behavior.",1
"Publisher Summary Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) is a mouse arterivirus, unusual in its extreme host specificity and its persistence in the circulation of the infected host that naturally infects wild mice. Although, probably not as frequent in laboratory mouse colonies as it used to be, LDV infection may affect experimental results, primarily through its effects on the host immune responses. On the other hand, because of its unique properties, LDV infections serve as a good animal model for viral persistence, virally induced immunomodulation, and pathogenic infection of neurons in the central nervous system. However, the inability of LDV to infect in transformed cell lines and to cause a detectable cytopathic effect in cell cultures in which it replicates, such as mouse peritoneal exudate cells, represents technical obstacles to the further analysis of this virus. Identification of the cell receptor utilized by LDV would constitute a major advance, since this might lead to the creation of a cell line permissive to LDV infection. Whereas LDV is a natural and sometimes pathogenic infectious agent of the mouse, it does not currently represent a major threat to animal facilities. The virus is not very contagious and there are a number of easy methods available to detect infected mice. Moreover, further study of the interaction between relatively silent viruses, such as LDV, and their host species should lead to new insights into the mechanisms by which viruses can establish and maintain relatively harmless, persistent infections in their hosts.",1
"Publisher Summary Zoonoses refers to the infectious diseases and infestations that are transmissible directly from an animal host to humans. The biomedical literature contains numerous reports of zoonotic diseases and parasitic infestations from laboratory mice and their wild counterparts. The extended maintenance of the laboratory mouse over a number of generations under controlled and increasingly sophisticated laboratory animal housing conditions with veterinary oversight and effective infection control measures has markedly reduced the likelihood that zoonotic agents would be encountered in a modem animal care and use environment. Wild caught mice that are maintained in naturalistic housing environments in the laboratory, laboratory mice that have contact with wild or feral mice, and mice kept as pets in the home environment are examples of animal management conditions that would be conducive to the expression and transmission of zoonotic diseases and other mouse-associated hazards. In addition to the zoonoses, mice are capable of inflicting bites on inadequately trained personnel and are a rich source of allergens for a substantial number of persons predisposed to develop mouse-associated allergic sensitivities. This chapter discusses the mouse-associated zoonotic diseases and other health hazards and explains the strategies that are helpful for reducing or eliminating the risk of personnel exposure to these conditions.",1
"Publisher Summary The frontier of clinical chemistry in the mouse has advanced and expanded because of two major events such as, the increasing reliance on mice in biomedical research, and increasing availability of practical yet sophisticated techniques and instrumentations that have allowed for the detection of a wider variety of biomarkers of disease. The progression of these two events is partially driven by the increasing regulatory demands related to safety/toxicity assessment of novel drug development. The availability of inbred strains has led to major breakthroughs in cancer, biology, and immunology. In addition, outbred stocks continue to be utilized in a wide variety of studies but particularly in the fields of toxicology and pharmacology. The power of these models to elucidate the genetic basis of disease cannot be overemphasized. This provided complete nucleotide sequences for each genome allowing investigators to quickly develop the equivalent murine model for many of the inherited human diseases. Transgenic and knockout mice have helped clarify disease pathogenesis in virtually every area of medicine and often elucidated biochemical pathways, previously unknown, which are now subject to testing and quantification.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter covers health care delivery for individual mice, quality assurance (QA) programs for research colonies of mice, and infectious outbreak sources and management. Comprehensive health care must be provided in all of these areas to be effective. An unwanted infectious agent that does not cause clinically evident signs could still have a major adverse impact on research results if allowed to disseminate. As a result, the program for providing health care must include detection and care of individual mice that are ill, routine colony surveillance to guard against the undetected entry and spread of previously excluded infectious agents, and a response plan if such agents are detected. Such programs result in humane care of animals and the best protection of experimental repeatability and validity. As infectious agents, detection and treatment methods, and the research environment evolve, the veterinary and husbandry staff caring for research animals must strive to keep themselves educated and informed. Animal health and QA programs are not static but are always a work in progress and must also evolve in response to the challenges and needs of the research community.",1
"Publisher Summary The increased use of inbred and genetically altered mice, often with compromised immune systems, has resulted in the need for stringent environmental conditions and management practices. This in turn has increased the need to thoroughly monitor the environment of mice and the equipment used for their care. Environmental and equipment monitoring are viewed as management tools used to control the quality of mice produced or housed in the facility. Their purpose is to help safeguard the health of the animals and personnel. In its distilled form, much of environmental and equipment monitoring is common sense coupled with a constant awareness that an animal care program is a dynamic organization dependent on the interaction of animals and people with the physical facility. If the animals are to remain healthy and the physical plant is to continue to function properly, there is little room for error. The errors arise neither from the animals nor the equipment but from the people who are responsible for developing a management policy and style that maintains the health of the animals and the integrity of the physical plant, yet at the same time makes it a pleasant and functional place for both mice and people to accomplish their intended tasks.",1

"Publisher Summary Natural killer (NK) cells comprise a finite lymphocyte lineage with distinctive gene expression patterns. Natural killer (NK) cells develop in the bone marrow (BM) and are not static but populate secondary and primary lymphoid organs. A unique feature of NK cells is their expression of activating and inhibitory receptors, which allow them to respond either when ligands for activating receptors are upregulated or when ligands for inhibitory receptors are downregulated. The unique transcriptome of NK cells renders them capable of protecting the host from a vast array of disease states. Their undisputed importance in host protection is conferred by their ability to eliminate unhealthy cells. However, in order for NK cells to exert their effects, they need to be strategically located at the right places. This chapter provides an overview of the current understanding of the localization of NK cell populations and their ability to migrate in response to homeostatic and pathological conditions. NK cells develop in the BM, which they exit using specific molecular interactions. Exit from the BM is followed by localization to a number of tissues, including secondary lymphoid organs. Within each tissue, NK cells often acquire unique function and phenotype that is regulated by the local microenvironment. Their localization is primarily directed by the action of chemokines and therefore is in tight association with the activation status of the organism. Changes in chemokine expression during disease results in further NK cell mobilization and allows them to protect the host from infection and malignancy. Thus, from their time of production until their end, NK cells travel exhaustively over long distances and visit places that influence their already dynamic life.",1
"Publisher Summary Natural killer (NK) cells belong to a distinct lineage of lymphocytes that play an important role in the early phase of immune responses against certain microbial pathogens by exhibiting cytotoxic functions and secreting a number of cytokines and chemokines. NK cells develop from a common lymphoid precursor resident in the bone marrow (BM) that is considered the main site of their generation. The BM microenvironment provides a rich source of cytokines and growth factors and allows intimate contact between developing NK cells and stromal cells, which is required for their full maturation. Individual NK cell subsets displaying unique functional features, and tissue locations have been identified both in mouse and humans. Involvement of chemokines in the regulation of DC-mediated NK cell priming and effector functions has also been documented and should be taken into account when analyzing the role of chemokines in NK cell-dependent immune responses. Studies in man and mouse have shown that NK cells are distributed in several organs under normal conditions. Their frequency is comparatively high in nonlymphoid organs such as the lung, the liver and the mucosal tissue of maternal uterus, and rare in thymus and lymph nodes. Chemotactic factors, including chemokines, play critical roles in the regulation of NK cell migration across endothelium and into the tissues. The differences in chemokine receptor expression together with distinct adhesive properties of different NK cell subsets as well as activated NK cells, imply that they have multiple routes of circulation and trafficking patterns. Besides their role in the regulation of NK cell trafficking, chemotactic molecules can also affect NK cell effector functions by regulating their priming and their ability to kill and secrete cytokines.",1
"Publisher Summary Natural killer (NK) cells, a prominent component of the innate immune system, are large granular lymphocytes that respond rapidly to a variety of insults via cytokine secretion and cytolytic activity. Recently, there has been growing insight into the biological functions of NK cells, in particular into their roles in infection, tumorurveillance and autoimmunity. Under these pathophysiological circumstances, NK cells readily home to the central nervous system (CNS) tissues to combat infection and presumably to curb progression of tumor. Bystander neuronal and/or glial cell damage can occur in this setting. Paradoxically, NK cells appear to have an inhibitory role for autoimmune responses within the CNS. As in the periphery, NK cells act in concert with T cells and other lymphocytes responsible for CNS pathology and immune regulation. Insights into the molecular signals and pathways governing the diverse biological effects of NK cells are keys for designing NK cell-based therapy for CNS infections, tumor and autoimmune diseases.NK cells readily accumulate in homing to CNS tissues under the pathophysiological situations. This process is tightly controlled by a number of chemokines and chemokine receptors. There is ample of evidence that NK cells within the CNS contribute to the control of infections and might limit progression of certain tumor. Bystander neuronal and/or glial cell damage can occur. In certain autoimmune conditions of the CNS, NK cells appear to have an inhibitory role. Disassociation of disease-inhibiting versus disease-promoting effects of NK cells is a key to harnessing NK cells for therapeutic purposes. To achieve this goal, a generation of genetic models with selective NK cell deficiency, and development of reagents (antibodies) for visualizing subsets of NK cells in situ will be necessary.",1

"Publisher Summary Travel changes people and places. The traveler can be the target and sufferer from microbial threats; the traveler can also provide the microbial transport system. Traveling humans alter infectious diseases patterns by introducing pathogenic microbes or resistance, or virulence factors into new populations. The movement of pathogenic microbes through history has been intimately linked to the capacity of humans to travel and to migrate to new locations. Today, humans have the capacity to reach virtually any city in the world within a day or two. Travel to tropical and developing countries are increasing more rapidly than travel to developed countries, and all projections suggest that human travel will continue to increase in the foreseeable future. Infectious diseases influence decisions about travel and trade; and travelers change the epidemiology of infectious diseases. Travel has played an essential role in the movement of HIV/AIDS throughout the world. Rapid international air travel moved the virus that causes SARS to multiple countries within weeks. Travel has been and will continue to be important in the movement of human influenza. Travel consists of sequential shared environments, often with people from diverse regions of the world. It should be considered a loop, and not just an origin and destination. Travel has created extensively interconnected world in terms of microbial threats.",1
"Publisher Summary The advent and effective use of new drugs, vaccines, insecticides, treatment, and prevention strategies during and following World War II reinforced public health programs already in place, and provided the tools needed to bring many of the worst diseases under control. Smallpox was eradicated using a mass vaccination strategy. The major successes in controlling infectious diseases in the 1950s and 1960s was followed by two coincident global trends that would have an impact on the dramatic reemergence of infectious diseases in the waning years of the twentieth century. The first was the redirection of the resources that were once used to control infectious diseases to other public health priorities, such as the “War on Cancer” in the early 1970s. The perception that infectious diseases were no longer a problem led to decreased resources, widespread deterioration of public health infrastructure to deal with infectious diseases, and complacency among government and public health officials as well as the public. This trend included medical education with a deemphasis on preventive medicine and a strong focus on curative medicine in medical schools. The second trend was the sharply increasing and unprecedented rate of human population growth following World War II that has continued for 60 years. Increasing human numbers have been a principal factor leading to uncontrolled urbanization, changes in agriculture, land use and animal husbandry practices, and accelerated globalization, all of which have been major and interrelated drivers of the reemergence of epidemic infectious diseases.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter is about components of volunteer blood donations that are each transfused as a single unit. A single donation of a pint of whole blood is virtually always separated by centrifugation into a unit of red blood cells and a unit of plasma; a unit of platelets or a unit of cryoprecipitated plasma can also be prepared, but this is done for less than half of whole blood donations, since patients' clinical needs for platelets and cryoprecipitated plasma are much less than patients' needs for red blood cell transfusion. Each of these units is labeled, and regulated as a drug, following FDA regulations. While today virtually all of these blood components from whole blood donation are from volunteer donors, the FDA would permit paying these donors, but requires that the component's label be marked conspicuously with the words “PAID DONOR” as opposed to “VOLUNTEER DONOR.” Whole blood donation is permitted no more often than once every eight weeks. Most of the plasma separated from red blood cell units is not needed for direct transfusion to patients, and so it is provided as “Recovered Plasma” to large multinational for-profit companies that pool and fractionate it into plasma derivatives. The major source of plasma for plasma derivative manufacture, however, is “Source Plasma” collected by plasmapheresis.",1
"Publisher Summary Bioterrorism is defined as the deliberate and malicious deployment of microbial agents or their toxins as weapons in a non-combat setting, represents perhaps the most overt example of human behavior impacting epidemic infectious diseases. There is historical precedent for the use of biological agents against both military and civilian populations. The use of biological (and chemical) agents as weapons of war has been well documented. The German biological warfare program during World War I included covert infections of Allied livestock with anthrax and glanders. The Japanese army began conducting experiments on the effects of bacterial agents of biowarfare on Chinese prisoners in occupied Manchuria in 1932 at their infamous Unit 731. The United States began its own offensive biological weapons program in 1942 and, during its 28-year official existence, weaponized and stockpiled lethal biological agents, such as anthrax, as well as incapacitating agents, such as the etiologic agent of Q fever. There are some recent examples of bioterrorism, though not necessarily resulting in attacks causing morbidity or mortality, may serve as harbingers of future events. Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq developed and deployed anthrax and botulinum-laden warheads in the years leading up to the Gulf War. The reasons that these weapons were never used in an actual attack probably had more to do with the implicit threat of overwhelming US retaliation and Iraqi technological deficiencies rather than the regime's reluctance to violate any moral principles. Biological agents have also been used to forward political ideologies: in 1984 a religious cult, intent on influencing voter turnout during a local election, contaminated restaurant salad bars in The Dalles, Oregon.",1
"Publisher Summary The worldwide upturn in the occurrence of both new (emerging) and reemerging or spreading infectious diseases highlights the importance of underlying environmental and social conditions as determinants of the generation, spread, and impact of infectious diseases in human populations. Human ecology is undergoing rapid transition. This encompasses urbanization, rising consumerism, changes in working conditions, population aging, marked increases in mobility, changes in culture and behavior, evolving health-care technologies, and other factors. Global climate change is becoming a further, and major, large-scale influence on the pattern of infectious disease transmission. It is likely to become increasingly important over at least the next halfcentury, as the massive, highinertial, and somewhat unpredictable process of climate change continues. The many ways in which climate change does and will influence infectious diseases are subject to a plethora of modifying influences by other factors and processes: constitutional characteristics of hosts, vectors and pathogens; the prevailing ambient conditions; and coexistent changes in other social, economic, behavioral, and environmental factors. This global anthropogenic process, climate change, along with other unprecedented global environmental changes, is beginning to destabilize and weaken the planet's life-support systems. Infectious diseases, unlike other diseases, depend on the biology and behavior—each often climate-sensitive—of two or more parties. Hence, these diseases will be particularly susceptible to changes as the world's climate and its climate-sensitive geochemical and ecological systems undergo change over the coming decades.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter explores the fundamental obligation of governments to protect health. This obligation extends not only to the provision of health care or to the control of infectious disease outbreaks, but also to the cessation of human rights violations that contribute to poor health or disease risk. The relationship between the health status of a population and the behavior of the government under which that population lives is important during war or civil crisis settings, and in the context of chronic health issues such as nutrition, famine, and child mortality. As measured by indicators such as accountability, stability, rule of law, respect for human rights, and the existence of an independent civil society, plays a significant role in health outcomes—a role independent of, and perhaps even superior to, host genetics, insect vectors, or individual behaviors. Famines stem not solely from bad weather or genetics, but also from the failure of governments to protect their populations from civil strife, or to equitably distribute food aid. Despite the widespread acceptance of these findings, the influence of governance on infectious disease spread has received far less attention. Both governance and health can be measured in many different ways, and one factor complicating efforts to measure the association between the two is the difficulty finding accurate, sensitive, and specific enough indicators for either variable. Broad measures of population health—such as life expectancy, and infant and maternal mortality—have been chosen by a number of authors, in part because these indicators capture multiple specific diseases and are broadly distributed across the population.",1

"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the anatomy, functions, and biochemistry of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF has four major functions: physical support of neural structures, excretion and “sink” action, intracerebral transport, and control of the chemical environment of the central nervous system. CSF provides a “water jacket” of physical support and buoyancy. The CSF is protective because its volume changes reciprocally with changes in the volume of intracranial contents, particularly blood. Thus, the CSF protects the brain from changes in arterial and central venous pressure associated with posture, respiration, and exertion. Acute or chronic pathological changes in intracranial contents can be accommodated, to a point, by changes in the CSF volume. The direct transfer of brain metabolites into the CSF provides excretory function. This capacity is important because the brain lacks a lymphatic system. The lymphatic function of the CSF is also manifested in the removal of large proteins and cells, such as bacteria or blood cells, by bulk CSF absorption. The “sink” action of the CSF arises from the restricted access of water-soluble substances to the CSF and the low concentration of these solutes in the CSF.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter provides an introduction to the book that focus on environmental microbiology. The book defines the important microorganisms that are involved in environmental microbiology, the nature of the different possible environments in which they are situated, the methodologies used to monitor microorganisms and their activities, and the possible effects of microorganisms on human activities. The book addresses the new challenges of modern environmental microbiology, in which pathogens and bioremediation remain fundamental to the field. However, in both cases, the subject areas have been greatly enhanced through the application of molecular genetics and biotechnological tools. Another important area that has been included is that of molecular ecology, which involves investigating diversity in the environment and mining and exploiting that diversity for new natural products and activities. Thus, this book can be used in teaching environmental microbiology as well as a general reference book for practitioners in the field of environmental microbiology.",1
"Publisher Summary The primary goal of wastewater treatment is the removal and degradation of organic matter under controlled conditions. This chapter describes the nature and modern treatment of waste water, land applications of waste water, and methods of land applications of biosolids and animal wastes. The amount of organic matter in domestic wastes determines the degree of required biological treatment. Various tests are used to assess the amount of organic matter: biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and total organic carbon (TOC). The complete sewage treatment comprises three major steps: primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment. Tertiary treatment processes involving physicochemical processes can be effective in reducing the concentration of pathogens. The treated domestic wastewater may be disposed of via land application for crop irrigation or as a means of additional treatment and disposal through the three basic methods that include low-rate irrigation, overland flow, and high-rate infiltration.",1

"Diarrheal diseases continue to contribute significant morbidity and mortality to pediatric populations in developed and developing countries around the world. The prevalence of diarrheal illness across cultures is inversely proportional to the availability of public sanitation, clean water supply, and adequate medical care. As such, it is not surprising that the incidence of diarrheal disease is much higher in developing societies and can approach 10 episodes per child per year in children under 5 years of age. In these areas, aggregate mortality can reach 3–5 million deaths per year. In the US and other developed nations, both the incidence (1–2 episodes per year) and mortality (approximately 400–500 deaths annually) are considerably decreased. Nonetheless, the burdens placed on Western healthcare systems by pediatric diarrheal disease are considerable and approximately 20% of all pediatric ambulatory visits and 10% of all inpatient hospital admissions in children under 3 years of age are for the evaluation and treatment of these disorders and their complications.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter concerns the breed of people who start by selecting a nonclinician path and eventually work in clinical simulation. Their new role requires their grasping a wide range of clinical and educational concepts and skills that should already be second nature to their new colleagues who are trained as an educator, a clinician, or health care professional. There are many different opportunities and responsibilities in the domain of clinical simulation, and nonclinicians could occupy almost any one of them. This ranges from educationalist, communication or team dynamic expert, technician, or technical manager, center coordinator, administrator, to operations manager. The background of potential simulation center employees will be an important asset in their new role as it could give them a different perspective, additional skills, and innovative ideas that complement those of their clinical colleagues.",1
"Publisher Summary Patient simulation offers clinical educators a new type of “canvas” where they can apply the principles of realism. While having the latest high-tech robotic patient simulators emplaced within fully functional clinical spaces is great, that alone does not provide enough realism. Naïve people are generally impressed by the mannequin and its capabilities, but the “patient” is the most artificial thing about simulation. It's more important to use the technology as a lens to focus on the human aspect of interactions. In the quest for realism, clinical educators create context by placing the mannequin in a simulated or real environment, breathe life into it with human interaction, and take advantage of the learner's imagination. To facilitate learners being more receptive to the educators, the Patient Simulation Center located at St. Michael's Hospital in downtown Toronto, Canada, always presents a supportive and nonthreatening atmosphere. It aims to provide experiential acquisition of skills and judgment, allowing lessons to be learned from errors made. Before starting, learners are familiarized to the environment and the mannequin, and provided with a set of ground rules. This is done on a need-to-know basis, being careful not to cognitively overload the learners with too many rules. There is no need to share all the capabilities and limitations of simulation or to explain how the props work. Keep it simple and user friendly. The rules will vary with the different levels of learners and with how they utilize simulation.",1

"Publisher Summary This chapter examines environmental inflammatory factors in vascular disease and dementia with a focus on infections, environmental inflammogens, and drugs that modulate both vascular disease and dementia. Infections and blood levels of inflammatory proteins are risk factors for future coronary events and possibly for dementia. When early age mortality is high, the survivors carry long-term infections that impair growth and accelerate mortality at later ages (“cohort morbidity phenotype”). Chronic infections, which are endured by most of the world's human and animal populations, cause energy reallocation for host defense. Infections and inflammation may impair stem cell generation, with consequences to arterial and brain aging. Diet may introduce glycotoxins that stimulate inflammation. Some anti-inflammatory and anti-coagulant drugs may protect against coronary artery disease and certain cancers, and possibly also for Alzheimer disease. These “pharmacopleiotropies” implicate shared mechanisms in diverse diseases of aging.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on the recent developments in the field of immunosensors. Immunosensors incorporate the specific immunochemical reaction with the modern transducers including electrochemical (potentiometric, conductometric, capacitative, impedance, amperometric), optical (fluorescence, luminescence, refractive index), and microgravimetric transducers. These immunosensor devices with dramatic improvements in the sensitivity and selectivity possess the abilities to investigate the reaction dynamics of antibody–antigen binding and the potential to revolutionize conventional immunoassay techniques. With the rapid development of immunological reagents and detection equipments, immunosensors have allowed an increasing range of analytes to be identified and quantified and in particular, simple-to-use, inexpensive, and reliable immunosensing systems have been developed for areas such as outpatient monitoring, large screening programs, and remote environmental surveillance. Immunosensors with lowered detection limits and increased sensitivities have been developed in various fields, particularly in clinical analysis. A noticeable development trend is also observed in the development of immunosensors combining with other techniques such as flow injection analysis (FIA) or capillary electrophoretic (CE) analysis, which complement and improve the present immunoassay methods. Belov et al. have proposed a novel immunophenotyping method for leukemias which uses a cluster of differentiation antibody microarray, and a microarray of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay has been developed for autoimmune diagnosis of systematic rheumatic disease. Development of microfluidic immunosensor systems for proteomics and drug discovery have also been reported in recent years where the microfluidic system integrates multiple processes in a single device to improve analytical performance by reducing the reagent consumption and the analysis time, and increasing reliability and sensitivity through automation.",1

"This article addresses issues that are central to the dual use of biotechnology, such as the public perception of risk and the need for physical containment to prevent the release of potentially dangerous microorganisms. It also examines the public and media perception of the scientists who handle and manipulate these pathogens and discusses the controls that are currently in place to ensure that scientists engaged in defense-related dual-use medical research act in a transparent and ethical manner. Finally, the article discusses what can be done by scientists to allay the fears of their fellow citizens.",1

"Inhalation exposes the upper and lower respiratory tracts of humans to a variety of airborne particles and vapors. Airborne transmission of pathogenic microorganisms to humans from the environment, animals, or other humans can result in disease. Inhalation is an important route of exposure as the lung is more susceptible to infection than the gastrointestinal tract. Ingested microorganisms must past through the acidic environment of the stomach before they can colonize tissue while inhaled microorganisms are deposited directly on the moist surfaces of the respiratory tract. Inhalation of microbial aerosols can elicit adverse human health effects including infection, allergic reaction, inflammation, and respiratory disease. Following inhalation, infectious viruses, bacteria, and fungi can establish in host cells of the respiratory tract. Some are translocated and infect the gastrointestinal tract and other tissues. This chapter discusses human viral, bacterial, and fungal diseases transmitted via aerosols. Viral diseases presented are influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs) and hantavirus disease, measles, and varicella. Bacterial diseases are Legionnaires’ disease, tuberculosis, and nontubercule mycobacterial disease. Exposure to some Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, endotoxin, and actinomycetes when dispersed through the air can result in disease following inhalation. Fungal diseases included are histoplasmosis, coccidiomycosis, blastomycosis, cryptococcosis, and aspergillosis. The threat of bioterrorism with airborne infectious agents is also briefly presented.",1
"Antiviral agents are drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment or control of viral infections. Available antiviral agents mainly target stages in the viral life cycle. The target stages in the viral life cycle are; viral attachment to host cell, uncoating, synthesis of viral mRNA, translation of mRNA, replication of viral RNA and DNA, maturation of new viral proteins, budding, release of newly synthesized virus, and free virus in body fluids. At least half of available antiviral agents are for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. The others are used mainly for the management of herpesviruses, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and respiratory viruses. Antiviral agents can be used for prophylaxis, suppression, preemptive therapy, or treatment of overt disease. Two important factors that can limit the utility of antiviral drugs are toxicity and the development of resistance to the antiviral agent by the virus. In addition, host phenotypic behaviors toward antiviral drugs because of either genomic or epigenetic factors could limit the efficacy of an antiviral agent in an individual. This article summarizes the most relevant pharmacologic and clinical properties of current antiviral agents, and targets for novel antiviral agents.",1
"Infectious diseases, whether caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites, are complex, dynamic, and constantly evolving. Some emerge or reemerge in human populations as they cross the species barrier from animals to humans, and once they have infected humans they may be asymptomatic or cause disease. If they cause disease, they may maintain their virulence or decrease in virulence with further passage through human populations. While some of these infectious agents transmit easily from human to human causing epidemics or pandemics, others may not be transmissible, but continue to sporadically infect humans as zoonotic infections. Still others, like HIV infection, may eventually become endemic infectious diseases in humans.",1
"Systematic efforts to quantify and monitor the burden of specific health conditions in populations, at the national level, started in the mid-1950s for malaria, poliomyelitis, and influenza in the United States. Comprehensive surveillance of morbidity and mortality for dozens of conditions has since been well established in the United States and in other industrialized countries. However, despite the clear need for epidemiological data to inform health policies, reliable and comprehensive health statistics are not available in many developing countries. International efforts to assess and monitor the burden of certain diseases have been limited in the past to a small number of infectious diseases in the context of global eradication programs – smallpox, poliomyelitis, guinea worm, and, more recently, HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and avian flu influenza A (H5N1). The Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD), published in 1996, filled an important gap in our knowledge of population health status. It created a common metric, the disability-adjusted life year (DALY), to estimate morbidity and mortality for eight regions that collectively span the world’s population, generating comparable information on incidence and prevalence in global health. However, patterns of disease, disability, and risk factors have since changed significantly and new data on their distribution are available. Furthermore, the unprecedented money and attention now pouring into international health has made an accurate assessment of global health patterns a matter of utmost urgency. The new Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD 2005) project, which began in 2007, represents the first major effort at a systematic revision of estimates in health for every region in the world comprehensively, and will ensure that that the global health community bases its research and policies on complete, valid, and reliable information. Burden of disease estimates provided in this article are for 2001 – the year for which the most recent estimates of the global burden of disease and risk factors are currently available. Causes of deaths were categorized into three main groups: group I (infectious diseases and maternal, perinatal, and nutritional conditions), group II (noncommunicable diseases), and group III (injuries). Accordingly, estimates of the global burden of infectious diseases are provided in the context of the overall burden from other conditions, diseases, and injuries. The relative importance of the burden of infectious diseases was forecasted to change by 2020. As the epidemiological transition progresses worldwide, a decline in the burden of infectious diseases is expected as the burden of noncommunicable diseases and injuries gradually increases. The pace of the epidemiological transition, however, varies greatly among regions so that the projected decreases in the burden of infectious diseases are expected to vary between regions. Trends in the global burden due to specific infectious diseases projected to 2020 also vary among specific conditions. The global burden of HIV/AIDS, for instance, is expected to greatly increase, whereas the global burden due to respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases is expected to decrease. Contrary to expectations, the global burden of malaria has increased in recent years.",1
"Surveillance is the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of data essential to public health practice for public health action, closely integrated with the timely dissemination of these data to those who need to know. Modern surveillance systems must meet the challenges of a dynamic emergence of infectious diseases and the factors that influence it, including human demographics and behavior, technology, economic development and land use, international travel and commerce, microbial adaptation and change, breakdown of public health measures, and potential acts of bioterrorism. Globally, the use of public health surveillance systems to track occurrences of infectious diseases and other public health threats has never been more important, and all countries have agreed to commit to conduct surveillance under the World Health Organization International Health Regulations (2005). Modern information technology can facilitate linking diverse sources of data, rapid analysis and synthesis of large amounts of information, and development of the communications and networks needed globally for surveillance and response to infectious diseases. Continued development of diagnostic and molecular laboratory methods, when effectively combined with epidemiologic information, can make prevention, recognition, and response to outbreaks faster and more effective.",1
"Zoonoses are the “diseases and infections that are naturally transmitted between vertebrate animals and man,” as defined in 1951 by the World Health Organization (WHO) Expert Committee on Zoonoses. The word zoonosis (plural zoonoses) is the combination of two Greek words (zoon, animals and noson, disease), and was coined at the end of the nineteenth century by Rudolph Virchow to designate human diseases caused by animals. Nevertheless, the term should also include vertebrate animal diseases caused by exposure to humans, such as measles in nonhuman primates, which is of major concern in any major primate center. The term ‘zoonosis’ is also considered to be shorter and more convenient than ‘anthropozoonosis’ (animals to humans) and ‘zooanthroponosis’ (humans to animals), which are based on the prevailing direction of transmission between humans and other vertebrates.",1
"Respiratory viruses are the most frequent causative agents of disease in humans, with significant impact on morbidity and mortality worldwide. Common respiratory agents from several virus families are well adapted to efficient person-to-person transmission and circulate in a global scale, and community-based studies conducted over the past five decades or so confirm that these viruses are the predominant etiological agents of acute respiratory infections (ARIs). The respiratory viruses that most commonly circulate in all continents as endemic or epidemic agents are influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, coronaviruses, adenoviruses, and bocaviruses. Although vaccines and effective antiviral drugs are not yet available for most of these viruses, much progress has been made in the understanding of their biology and fundamental issues of host–parasite relationship. This article is a summary of the current knowledge about these viruses.",1
"Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that can exist as potentially active but inert entities outside of cells. While there are viruses that infect many animal, plant, and protist cells and result in effects on the host that range from inapparent infection to lethality, all virus infections have some features in common. These include an entry phase, an intracellular phase consisting of multiplication, integration, or latency formation, a virus release phase, and usually some sort of host responses to the presence of the virus infection. It is often these host responses that appear as the most prominent signs and symptoms of virus infection.",1
"Infectious diseases of farm animals are one of the major threats to agriculture and can cause considerable damage at local, regional, and even at the international level both in industrialized and in developing countries. In the last two centuries considerable efforts have been invested in understanding the causes and pathogenesis of viral and bacterial diseases of domestic animals. These studies have introduced new methodologies for the diagnosis, treatment, and control of veterinary diseases. Importantly, research on veterinary pathogens also had a major impact in understanding basic biological processes of viruses and bacteria. In some cases, studies on veterinary pathogens have revolutionized biology and established entire new disciplines. This article will furnish a historical perspective on how studies of animal diseases, focusing on viral diseases in particular, have made a major contribution on the current understanding of pathogen biology. In addition, the main features of some of the most important viral diseases of farm animals will be described. Climate and environmental changes can favor the emergence of new pathogens or the reemergence of old ones. It is critical that resources be devoted to research and surveillance of veterinary pathogens in order to preserve and improve both animal and human health.",1

"The health transition is used to refer to the transitions in morbidity and mortality from infectious to noncommunicable disease, as a consequence of medical interventions and improvements in material conditions of living. Anthropologists and other social scientists have illustrated, however, that epidemiological trends are influenced by cultural, social, and behavioral determinants of health. These factors, with variations in the physical environment, have led to the continued prevalence of infectious disease concurrent with a rise in chronic and degenerative conditions. In this article, I discuss how anthropology has contributed to our understanding of health transitions, using specific diseases, conditions, and contexts to highlight the variable causes, understandings, and responses to such changes.",1
"Health-care demand analysis provides information that policy makers can use to improve a population's health. Since demand estimates identify determinants of health-care utilization, the estimates could be used to design policies to improve access to health facilities. However, evidence on health-care demand alone is insufficient to implement policies aimed at improving health. To facilitate implementation of such interventions, it is necessary to link health-care utilization to health status. This article provides an exposition of a model that links health-care demand to health production. Implications of the model in settings of information imperfections and lack of self-control in health-care markets are analyzed.",1
"One of the key roles of public health is to manage outbreaks that endanger the public's health. The nature of an outbreak can be due to a wide range of causes, and a variety of approaches to detection of epidemics is possible, but the main points are very similar for all outbreaks and are described in this article. The first challenge is to notice an increase in cases and to confirm an outbreak. Based on descriptive epidemiology, a case definition and hypothesis are developed, which is preferably confirmed by at least an epidemiologic study. Other aspects of investigation described in this article are the organization of the outbreak investigation and the importance of communication.",1
"This article discusses the role and methodology of disease surveillance, which provides epidemiological data to formulate actions to control or eliminate disease hazard, one of the indispensable systems in national and global public health intelligence services. The target diseases include not only infectious diseases but also noncommunicable diseases as well as accidents and injuries. Efficacy is increasing with ever-newer diagnostic technology as well as expanding information technology. A few experiences in how surveillance has played an essential role in disease control are illustrated.",1
"Acute respiratory tract infections are an extremely common and important source of morbidity and mortality. Despite advances in our understanding of microbial pathogens and the development of novel antimicrobial agents, acute respiratory tract infections continue to place an enormous burden on global health expenditure. Acute respiratory tract infections can be divided into infections that predominantly affect the upper respiratory tract above the vocal cords and those that affect the lower respiratory tract. The clinical features, causative pathogens, and therapies of common acute respiratory tract infections are detailed in this article.",1
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV), spread largely via droplets. Patients present with rapidly progressive pneumonia and respiratory failure. Diagnosis requires the demonstration of epidemiological linkage, clinical profiles, and virological evidence of SARS-CoV infection. Treatment of SARS is largely anecdotal. High-dose corticosteroid therapy might be useful for critically ill patients, but previous use of ribavirin (a broad-spectrum antiviral agent) was probably not efficacious. Some survivors of SARS suffer from avascular necrosis of hip and knee joints. Poor prognostic factors include advanced age, comorbidities, and high serum lactate dehydrogenase and neutrophil levels.",1
"Two of the most important tools that assist states in protecting their populations against threats to health are public health policy and public health law. Policy can exist without recourse to law, but where policy has been designed for a long-term purpose, and where voluntary compliance has not proved successful, policy may need the heavier hand of law for implementation. However, law is not always an appropriate mechanism for achieving public health objectives. This article explores the boundaries of public health policy and public health law, and examines how they might work as dual mechanisms for public health.",1
"The field of international public health and the contribution of international organizations to its development is described. The growth and elaboration of the field of international public health law in the last decade and a half is one of the most notable developments in global health policy. In this new era of global health governance, international law has an important, albeit limited, role to play in promoting and coordinating international cooperation and national action to protect and promote global health. Particular attention is paid to the global health impact of international law developed under the auspices of the World Health Organization and the World Trade Organization.",1
"This article describes how health care, including public health, is financed, organized, and delivered in Canada.

"Emerging from a small, wartime government program with a regional focus on malaria in 1946, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has become a global public health agency that addresses the entire scope of public health, with over 10000 employees and contractors in nearly 200occupations. The CDC's expertise has expanded in direct correlation with the expanding view of public health needs: it is recognized globally for its ability to respond to urgent threat related to disease epidemics and the health consequences of disaster and war. CDC programs have contributed significantly to the eradication and reduction of diseases such as smallpox, polio, and guinea worm, as well as the control of health problems such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), childhood lead poisoning, breast and cervical cancer, diabetes, violence, and unintentional injuries. CDC contributions in applied epidemiology, public health surveillance, risk factor reduction, and environmental risk assessment also have been critical to the practice of public health in the United States and around the world. The emerging concerns of the new century – genomics, globalization, the built environment, information technology, global warming, emerging infections, violence, and so forth – will require not only the traditional disciplines but also new expertise and new global partners, both public and private.",1

The global forces that necessitated its establishment continue to mold and influence the organization. This article discusses how the World Health Organization started, its functions, and what it is doing to maintain its relevance in the twenty-first century. This article also brings into focus the fight against tropical diseases.",1
"This article reviews in a historical perspective and by means of documented examples the scientific principles relevant to the concept and effectiveness of quarantine, the logistic, economic, and political barriers to its correct implementation through time, and the health impact of local and large-scale quarantine. Quarantine is overall one of the oldest and most disseminated and, despite its limits, most effective health measures elaborated by mankind. The evidence-based history of medicine and evidence-based modern epidemiology indicate that the implementation of correct quarantine procedures is today still feasible and useful provided that a proactive collaboration is operative among those concerned and that the measures are tailored according to geographical, social, and health conditions.",1
"Since its introduction in 1992, the paradigm that views the emergence of new human infections as a product of man-made ‘factors of emergence’ has been widely adopted. However, only some of these factors have been studied in depth. This article reviews three factors that have been characterized scientifically: changes in land use, travel and trade, and microbial adaptation and change. The introduction of new factors by the Institute of Medicine has created overlapping of domains for research. To adequately define the operation of man-made factors will require careful multidisciplinary research, and the development and testing of metrics to describe factors that operate alone and with other factors in the emergence of new infections.",1
"Emerging infectious diseases are diseases that are either new, are newly recognized, or are increasing in prevalence in new areas. Resurgent diseases are also usually grouped in this category, as is antimicrobial resistance. These diseases have been given formal recognition in the past two decades, although a historical outlook demonstrates that the phenomenon has probably been persistent, although largely undetected, through recorded history. Emergence has accelerated recently, driven by factors such as demographic change, land use change, increased rapidity and frequency of intercontinental transportation, and other mostly social trends. Continued infectious disease emergence poses, and will continue to pose, significant challenges for public health and for basic science.",1
"Blood transfusion services are an important part of the health-care system since blood transfusion is required in a number of frequently occurring clinical situations: Major surgical procedures, including treatment of trauma patients; obstetric care with major bleeding during child birth; and treatment of several medical diseases, especially hematological diseases. This article outlines the essential safety aspects of blood transfusion from the proper selection of the unpaid blood donor to processing and appropriate testing of the blood unit to safety aspects of transfusion, which include the appropriate clinical use of blood and blood components. The importance of accurate reporting of any adverse reactions to blood transfusion, which form the basis for a hemovigilance system, is reviewed.",1
"Of the annual burden of 10 million deaths among children under 5 years, a large proportion is associated with infectious diseases. These include 36% of the 4 million newborn deaths due to sepsis, pneumonia, diarrhea, and tetanus. Among the postneonatal deaths due to infections, estimates and uncertainty bounds include: 22% of deaths attributed to diarrhea (14–30%), 21% to pneumonia (14–24%), 9% to malaria (6–13%), and 1% to measles (1–9%). Some 42 countries alone account for almost 90% of the global burden of child mortality. There is now sufficient evidence available on evidence-based interventions that can make a difference. It is estimated that almost two-thirds of these deaths are potentially preventable if interventions can be delivered at scale. Newborn infections and related mortality can be reduced by maternal tetanus toxoid vaccination, clean delivery, cord hygiene, exclusive and early breast-feeding, and prompt diagnosis and therapy. Diarrheal deaths can be prevented by adequate attention to breast-feeding, hand-washing and sanitation strategies, rota virus vaccine, adequate treatment including oral rehydration, appropriate dietary therapy, and oral zinc administration. Similarly, the global burden of pneumonia deaths can be reduced by vaccination strategies for measles, Hib, and pneumococcal disease, timely case detection, and treatment with appropriate antibiotics.",1
"Bacterial infections have a large impact on public health. Disease can occur at any body site and can be caused by the organism itself or by the body's response to its presence. Bacteria are transmitted to humans through air, water, food, or living vectors. The principal modes of transmission of bacterial infection are contact, airborne, droplet, vectors, and vehicular. Preventive measures have a dramatic impact on morbidity and mortality. Such measures include water treatment, immunization of animals and humans, personal hygiene measures, and safer sex practices. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a growing concern mandating their prudent use.",1
"Rhinovirus is the major cause of common colds in humans. For many years, common colds were considered a trivial disease, but more recent evidence suggests that the many serotypes of rhinovirus are responsible for triggering the development of acute viral otitis media and sinusitis, exacerbation of asthma in children and adults, and exacerbation of chronic bronchitis in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In addition to improved symptomatic treatment of colds, new treatment strategies are needed to reduce the morbidity of rhinovirus infections. Further understanding of the pathogenesis of rhinovirus infection in the ear, sinus, and lower airways is warranted.",1

"Publisher Summary This chapter provides guidelines for manuscript preparation of life science journals. The rules for writing in life science are consistent with those in earth and environmental sciences and medical science. As with all scientific writing, it is important to research the specific needs and preferences of the journal to which the manuscript is being sent. This will not only ease the writing process, but will also increase the chances of publication. This chapter explains biochemical nomenclature and abbreviations used in life science. In addition, it includes a list of preferred units in the life sciences. In scientific writing, especially in the United States, articles dealing with life science issues are appearing much less frequently than those in other scientific disciplines.",1
"Concern that a terrorist group might attack civilian populations or agriculture by releasing deadly pathogens has grown in the past decade. Failed attempts by the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo to release botulinum toxin and anthrax in Tokyo on several occasions in the early 1990s, and the 2001 anthrax letter attacks in the United States seem to confirm these fears. However, there were only five fatalities in the US case and none in the Japanese case. The question naturally arises: How serious is this threat and, if it is serious, what strategy should states take to combat it? This article draws on US experience to outline a strategy for combating bioterrorism that is general enough to apply to most states, especially ones with well developed public health and medical infrastructures.",1

"Publisher Summary This chapter examines the anatomy of the human lung and the pathology of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The normal human bronchogram shows that the length of pathways from the trachea to the terminal airways differs depending on the pathway followed and it can take as few as 8 or as many as 24 divisions of airway branching to reach the gas-exchanging surface. The small bronchi and bronchioles 2 mm in diameter are spread out from the fourth to the fourteenth generation of airway branching. The pathology of asthma is dominated by widespread plugging of the segmental, subsegmental, and smaller conducting airways that leads to hyperinflation but not destruction of the parenchyma. These airway plugs are a manifestation of the fluid and cellular exudative phase of an inflammatory process based in the airway tissue. The chronic bronchitis of COPD is defined by excess cough with sputum production and is associated with an inflammatory process located in the mucosa, gland ducts, and glands of intermediate-sized bronchi between 2 and 4 mm internal diameter. The airway obstruction in COPD is the result of a similar inflammatory response in the smaller bronchi and bronchioles under 2 mm internal diameter, where the repair process associated with chronic inflammation thickens the airway wall and narrows the lumen to cause fixed airway obstruction.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter reviews the epidemiological evidence implicating infectious pathogens as triggers and will discuss the mechanisms of interaction between the host–pathogen response and preexisting airway pathology that result in an exacerbation. Asthma is a multifaceted syndrome involving atopy, bronchial hyperreactivity, and IgE and non-IgE-mediated acute and chronic immune responses. The asthmatic airway is characterized by an infiltrate of eosinophils and of T-lymphocytes expressing the type 2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Trigger factors associated with acute exacerbations of asthma include exposure to environmental allergens, especially animals, molds, pollens and mites, cold, exercise, and drugs. The frequency of exacerbations is a major factor in the quality of life of patients with COPD. The typical clinical features of an exacerbation include increased dyspnea, wheezing, cough, sputum production, and worsened gas exchange. Although noninfectious causes of exacerbations such as allergy, air pollution, or inhaled irritants including cigarette smoke may be important, acute airway infections are the major precipitants. The infection and consequent host inflammatory response result in increased airway obstruction. The success of vaccination to prevent respiratory virus infections has been limited by significant variation within the major virus types causing disease. Currently much of the treatment of infective exacerbations of asthma and COPD is symptomatic, consisting of increased bronchodilators, either short-acting β 2—agonists in inhaled or intravenous form or anticholinergics or theophyllines, or supportive in the form of oxygen and in severe cases noninvasive or invasive ventilatory measures.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter describes the optimal approach to antibiotic treatment of exacerbations recognizing these limitations. Such an approach relies upon an accurate diagnosis of an exacerbation, including judicious application of diagnostic tests. Determining the severity of an exacerbation follows this. If antibiotics are indicated, then a risk stratification approach is described to choose an appropriate antibiotic. An increase in airway inflammation from the baseline level in a patient appears central to the pathogenesis of most acute exacerbations. Airway inflammation measured in induced or expectorated sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage or bronchial biopsy has revealed that increased inflammation accompanies exacerbations and resolves with treatment. Potential pathogens in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations include typical respiratory bacterial pathogens, respiratory viruses, and atypical bacteria. The current model of bacterial exacerbation pathogenesis involves both host and pathogen factors. Acquisition of strains of bacterial pathogens that are new to the host from the environment is the primary event that puts the patient with COPD at risk for an exacerbation. The traditional aims of treatment of an exacerbation are improvement in clinical status and the prevention of complications. The role of antibiotics in the treatment of COPD exacerbations has been a matter of controversy. Even more contentious has been the issue whether antibiotic choice is relevant to clinical outcome of exacerbations. Recommendations for antibiotic use among published guidelines are inconsistent.",1
"Publisher Summary There has been considerable recent interest into the causes and mechanisms of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as COPD exacerbations are an important cause of the considerable morbidity and mortality found in COPD. COPD exacerbations increase with increasing severity of COPD. Earlier descriptions of COPD exacerbations had concentrated mainly on studies of hospital admission, though most COPD exacerbations are treated in the community and not associated with hospital admission. Exacerbation frequency is an important determinant of health status in COPD and is thus one of the important outcome measures in COPD. Factors predictive of frequent exacerbations included daily cough and sputum and frequent exacerbations in the previous year. In a further prospective analysis of 504 exacerbations, where daily monitoring was performed, there was some deterioration in symptoms, though no there were significant peak expiratory flow changes. Recovery was longer in the presence of increased dyspnoea or symptoms of a common cold at exacerbation. The changes observed in lung function at exacerbation were smaller than those observed at asthmatic exacerbations. The reasons for the incomplete recovery of symptoms and lung function are not clear, but may involve inadequate treatment or persistence of the causative agent. The incomplete physiological recovery after an exacerbation could contribute to the decline in lung function with time in patients with COPD. The association of the symptoms of increased dyspnoea and of the common cold at exacerbation with a prolonged recovery suggests that viral infections may lead to more prolonged exacerbations.",1
"Publisher Summary The term molecular epidemiology emerged apparently independently during the 1970s to early 1980s in the literature of three separate substantive areas of epidemiology: cancer epidemiology, environmental epidemiology, and infectious disease epidemiology. Although these separate substantive areas agree that epidemiology refers to the distribution of disease in a population and the determinants of that distribution, the literature presents conflicting definitions of what makes a study a molecular epidemiologic study. In cancer and environmental epidemiology, molecular is defined almost exclusively in terms of biomarkers. However, biomarkers are only one type of molecular measure, and this definition ignores the many applications of molecular methods in genetic and infectious disease epidemiology. Early epidemiologists made tremendous strides with what are now relatively simple molecular tools, such as using microscopy for identification, showing agents not visible by microscope cause disease, and detecting protective antibodies with hemagglutination assays. In the microbiology literature, molecular epidemiology has become synonymous with the use of molecular fingerprints—regardless of whether the study was population based or met other criteria consistent with an epidemiologic study. Moreover, the molecular tools available, and the potential for applications for studies of populations, have changed substantially since the term molecular epidemiology was coined.",1
"Publisher Summary Molecular tools enhance outbreak investigation and surveillance, facilitate description of the transmission system, and increase understanding of the epidemiology. Molecular tools enhance case definitions, increasing specificity and reducing misclassification, and are now a standard tool in outbreak investigations. Although it is assumed during an outbreak that a single microbe is causing the clinical symptoms, it is possible that a microbe of the same genus and species but different strain is causing disease during the same time period. Molecular typing can distinguish between outbreak and nonoutbreak strains. Molecular tools also facilitate estimating parameters key to understanding the transmission system, including the incidence, prevalence, transmission probability, duration of carriage, effective dose, and probability of effective contact. Molecular tools enable one to trace the dissemination of a particular subtype across time and space and thus develop theories of transmission and dissemination, determine the origin of an epidemic and test theories about reservoirs and evolution of a particular pathogen, follow the emergence of new infections as they cross species, testing the hypotheses about the apparent transmissibility and rate of evolution, and follow mobile genetic elements conferring antimicrobial resistance or virulence between strains within a species or between species, and so develop theories about evolution and transmission within the populations of pathogens.",1
"Publisher Summary For proper interpretation of study results, further reliability assessment is required to determine the variability from repeated samples from the same individual, and variation among individuals. Repeated samples from the same individual will indicate if the measure varies with time of day, menstrual cycle, or consumption of food or liquids. The extent that this impacts the reliability will dictate if the protocol should stipulate timing of specimen collection. The dynamics of colonization of human body sites by microbes are essentially unknown. Currently there are few estimates in the literature of how frequently there is a change in the bacterial strains (or other colonizing microbes) that commonly colonize the human gut, mouth, vaginal cavity, and skin. Also unknown is the average duration of carriage. There are some estimates for group B Streptococcus; colonization is very dynamic, with an average duration of carriage of ∼14 weeks among women. This suggests that assessments of reliability must be done over a short time, and that loss over 2-week period could as easily reflect true loss as sampling error.",1

"ABSTRACT Quasispecies theory is providing a solid, evolving conceptual framework for insights into virus population dynamics, adaptive potential, and response to lethal mutagenesis. The complexity of mutant spectra can influence disease progression and viral pathogenesis, as demonstrated using virus variants selected for increased replicative fidelity. Complementation and interference exerted among components of a viral quasispecies can either reinforce or limit the replicative capacity and disease potential of the ensemble. In particular, a progressive enrichment of a replicating mutant spectrum with interfering mutant genomes prompted by enhanced mutagenesis may be a key event in the sharp transition of virus populations into error catastrophe that leads to virus extinction. Fitness variations are influenced by the passage regimes to which viral populations are subjected, notably average fitness decreases upon repeated bottleneck events and fitness gains upon competitive optimization of large viral populations. Evolving viral quasispecies respond to selective constraints by replication of subpopulations of variant genomes that display higher fitness than the parental population in the presence of the selective constraint. This has been profusely documented with fitness effects of mutations associated with resistance of pathogenic viruses to antiviral agents. In particular, selection of HIV-1 mutants resistant to one or multiple antiretroviral inhibitors, and the compensatory effect of mutations in the same genome, offers a compendium of the molecular intricacies that a virus can exploit for its survival. This chapter reviews the basic principles of quasispecies dynamics as they can serve to explain the behavior of viruses.",1
"ABSTRACT Retroviruses manifest a very rich ensemble of genome structures. The evolution of retroviruses varies enormously, with fixation rates varying by as much as a million fold. The emergence of novel genome structures follows remorselessly with the fixation of point mutations and is most apparent for the lentivirus subgroup that has burst on the scene recently. Accordingly, bio-logic suggests that new genome structures will emerge among the lentiviruses, most notably HIV-1.",1
"ABSTRACT In the last 30 years, the study of virus evolution has undergone a transformation. Originally concerned with disease and its emergence, virus evolution had not been well integrated into the general study of evolution. This chapter reviews the developments that have brought us to this new appreciation for the general significance of virus evolution to all life. We now know that viruses numerically dominate all habitats of life, especially the oceans. Theoretical developments in the 1970s regarding quasispecies, error rates, and error thresholds have yielded many practical insights into virus–host dynamics. The human diseases of HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus cannot be understood without this evolutionary framework. Yet recent developments with poliovirus demonstrate that viral fitness can be the result of a consortia, not one fittest type, a basic Darwinian concept in evolutionary biology. Darwinian principles do apply to viruses, such as with Fisher population genetics, but other features, such as reticulated and quasispecies-based evolution distinguish virus evolution from classical studies. The available phylogenetic tools have greatly aided our analysis of virus evolution, but these methods struggle to characterize the role of virus populations. Missing from many of these considerations has been the major role played by persisting viruses in stable virus evolution and disease emergence. In many cases, extreme stability is seen with persisting RNA viruses. Indeed, examples are known in which it is the persistently infected host that has better survival. We have also recently come to appreciate the vast diversity of phage (DNA viruses) of prokaryotes as a system that evolves by genetic exchanges across vast populations (Chapter 10). This has been proposed to be the “big bang” of biological evolution. In the large DNA viruses of aquatic microbes we see surprisingly large, complex and diverse viruses. With both prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA viruses, recombination is the main engine of virus evolution, and virus host co-evolution is common, although not uniform. Viral emergence appears to be an unending phenomenon and we can currently witness a selective sweep by retroviruses that infect and become endogenized in koala bears.",1

"Macular edema that results from blood–retinal barrier (BRB) breakdown is a cause of significant visual loss associated with a variety of ocular disorders. BRB breakdown is a complex process that is regulated by multiple factors and involves different mechanisms. A variety of therapeutic approaches have shown modest suppression of macular edema, but to obtain greater efficacy, it is likely that multiple molecules, operating through distinct mechanisms, may need to be targeted. Studies aimed at identifying key target molecules and the optimal strategies for inhibiting them are ongoing in several laboratories.",1
"Secondary photoreceptor degenerations can be partially distinguished from primary photoreceptor degenerations based upon whether or not correction of the defect in the photoreceptors themselves would be sufficient to arrest photoreceptor death. The distinction is by no means perfect, since there can be genetic mutations that affect directly the survival of photoreceptors as well as the survival of adjacent retinal or retinal pigment epithelium cells that could secondarily be critical for photoreceptor survival. As we attempt to distinguish intrinsic and extrinsic causes of both primary and secondary photoreceptor degenerations, it is increasingly clear that complex interactions and mechanisms can be involved.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on the health benefits of traditional culinary and medicinal plants of the Mediterranean region. The Mediterranean diet is mentioned to be rich in fruits and vegetables, monounsaturated fatty acids and olive oil and the diet has a negative association with incidence of metabolic syndrome that contributes to an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Mediterranean plants are believed to prevent or cure a wide range of ailments based on their bioactive components that can exert anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic or anti-diabetic activities. A table is presented that gives a list of Mediterranean plants and their health benefits as well as brief accounts of the medicinal use of the plants and includes rosemary, licorice, chamomile and olive oil among others. The consumption of olive oil has a strong correlation with reduced hypertension, cancers of the prostate, breast and colon. It highlights the mechanism of action of the bioactive components and the molecular targets derived from these plants.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on gender differences in emerging infectious diseases. An urgent worldwide threat is posed by the introduction and spread of novel infectious diseases. The reasons for emerging infectious diseases are numerous and complex. Among the most significant explanations for these emerging diseases are changes in environment and ecology caused by natural phenomena such as droughts, hurricanes, and floods; and human-made phenomena such as agricultural development, urbanization, and denuding of forests. Worldwide conflict, including wars, ethnic cleansing, and genocide, have led to displacement of large populations into overcrowded settlements where safe water is not available and sanitation is poor. For example, unsanitary conditions led to a huge increase in the rat population in post-war Kosovo, resulting in a tularemia outbreak with 327 confirmed cases in 8 months. Regional conflict leads to breakdown in infection control, inadequate surveillance, impeded access to populations, and spread of infectious diseases through movement of refugees and aid workers. Increased precipitation, a result of climate change, leads to more agricultural run-off, allowing pathogens to enter drinking water systems. In developing countries where poverty and inadequate infrastructure are the norm, public health monitoring systems must be supported and improved so that new or more severe risks to health can be identified and curtailed. As new infectious diseases are recognized, critical issues arise regarding pregnant women and their unborn children. Physiologic changes during pregnancy and gestational age both alter decision-making regarding vaccinations and medications.",1
"Publisher Summary Despite advances in peripartum care, maternal morbidity and mortality associated with infections in pregnancy are increasing even in developed countries. Recently published data from the Center for Disease Control's Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System indicates that although maternal mortality from hemorrhage, embolism, and anesthesia has declined in the United States, the proportion of maternal deaths due to infections has increased. During 1991–7 infection accounted for 13.2% of pregnancy-related deaths overall and 36.3% of abortion-related deaths. The greatest infection risk is found in blacks, older women, women without prenatal care, and women with multiple pregnancy. In the United States pregnancy rates are stable or increasing in these groups. Infection is also a major cause of morbidity and mortality for the fetus and newborn. Many perinatal infections are associated with intra-uterine growth retardation and low birthweight, or cause fetal and neonatal brain injury. Infections, particularly bacterial vaginosis and chorioamnionitis, can result in preterm delivery of live-born infants (delivery before 37 weeks gestation), or stillbirth. A multitude of immunologic, endocrinologic, metabolic, physiologic, and anatomic changes influence the likelihood and course of many infections during pregnancy. Some of these changes are intrinsic, and occur in all normal pregnancies, while others occur to varying degrees in normal and abnormal pregnancies.",1
"The interferon (IFN) response is a powerful system that was evolutionarily acquired by vertebrates including mammals to protect against viral infection. The cytoplasmic RNA helicases, RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), were discovered in 2004 as viral sensors that trigger the antiviral IFN response by recognizing the nonself signatures of viral RNAs. The mechanisms underlying the recognition of viral RNAs and signal transduction leading to the production of type I IFN have been intensively studied following the discovery of RLRs. Moreover, a dysregulation in the expression of RLR or aberrant RLR signaling has been implicated in the development of a number of autoimmune diseases. We herein provide an overview of recent advances in RLR research and discussed future directions.",1
"Receptors for the Fc portion of immunoglobulins (FcRs) account for most cell-mediated biological activities of antibodies. The majority of FcRs are encoded by a set of genes, clustered in the fcr locus, on chromosome 1 in humans and on chromosome 1 and 3 in mice. Eight (in humans) and six (in mice) new genes were found, intermixed with FcR genes in corresponding fcr loci, which encode FcR-like molecules (FcRLs). FcRs and FcRLs are genetically, phylogenetically, structurally, and functionally related. FcRs and FcRLs, however, markedly differ by their ligands, their tissue distribution, and, therefore, by the biological functions they control. A systematic comparison of their biological properties leads to the conclusion that FcRLs are not like FcRs. They altogether form a single family within the immunoreceptor family, whose members fulfill distinct but complementary roles in immunity by differentially controlling innate and adaptive responses.",1
"New interferons (IFNs) include members of the type I IFN family, such as IFN epsilon (IFNε), IFN tau, IFN omega, and IFN kappa, as well as the type III IFN family, also known as the IFN lambdas. By comparison the classical or ‘old’ IFNs comprise the 14 subtypes of IFN alpha and IFN beta, which are all members of the type I IFN family, as well as type II IFN gamma. In this article, we examine the new IFNs and specifically discuss their discovery, comparative structures, functions in physiology and disease, the signaling pathways they initiate, and their regulatory controls. We highlight IFNε that was discovered in our laboratory and characterized for its role in protecting the female reproductive tract from infections.",1
"Viruses have evolved numerous mechanisms to evade the immune response, including proteins that target the function of cytokines. This article provides an overview of the different strategies used by viruses to block the induction of cytokines and immune signals triggered by cytokines. Examples of virus evasion proteins are presented, such as intracellular proteins that block signal transduction and immune activation mechanisms, secreted proteins that mimic cytokines, or viral decoy receptors that inhibit the binding of cytokines to their cognate receptors. Virus-encoded proteins that target cytokines play a major role in immune modulation, and their contributions to viral pathogenesis, promoting virus replication or preventing immunopathology, are discussed.",1
"The prompt and tightly controlled induction of type I interferon is a central event of the immune response against viral infection. This response relies on the recognition of incoming pathogens by cellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which then trigger various signaling cascades that result in proinflammatory cytokines and interferon production. Tripartite motif (TRIM)–containing proteins recently emerged as a large family of RING-finger E3 ubiquitin ligases with essential regulatory roles during many phases of the antiviral response, either acting as restriction factors or by modulating PRR signaling. In this article, we discuss recent advances in understanding the role of TRIMs in conferring direct antiviral activity as well as in regulating immune signaling pathways.",1
"CD8 T lymphocytes are a major cell population of the adaptive immune system. A fundamental characteristic of the CD8 T lymphocyte pool is that it is composed of millions of clones; each with a unique T cell receptor capable of recognizing a limited number of peptides displayed at the cell surface bound to the grooves of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules. Naïve CD8 T lymphocytes are normally resting and circulate between the blood and secondary lymphoid organs in search of their cognate peptide–MHC complexes. During viral infections, bone marrow–derived professional antigen-presenting cells (pAPCs) in secondary lymphoid organs display viral peptides on their MHC I molecules. Specific CD8 T lymphocytes that recognize these peptide–MHC adducts become activated (primed), proliferate extensively, and develop into effectors capable of killing infected cells, identified by the presence at their surface of the pertinent viral peptide–MHC complexes. This article describes how the process of priming naïve CD8 T lymphocytes occurs.",1
"The T cell response is an integral and essential part of the host immune response to acute virus infection. Each viral pathogen has unique, frequently nuanced, aspects to its replication, which affects the host response and as a consequence the capacity of the virus to produce disease. There are, however, common features to the T cell response to viruses, which produce acute limited infection. This is true whether virus replication is restricted to a single site, for example, the respiratory tract (RT), CNS etc., or replication is in multiple sites throughout the body. In describing below the acute T cell response to virus infection, we employ acute virus infection of the RT as a convenient model to explore this process of virus infection and the host response. We divide the process into three phases: the induction (initiation) of the response, the expression of antiviral effector activity resulting in virus elimination, and the resolution of inflammation with restoration of tissue homeostasis.",1
"Most vaccines in use today are the result of empirical development. The mechanism of action of many vaccines in common use remains incompletely understood. Understanding how such vaccines protect is an ongoing subject of study using increasingly sophisticated immunological tools, such as B cell and T cell repertoire and transcriptome analysis. Such tools are also being applied to the design of vaccines against those viral targets that have evaded vaccine-mediated protection thus far. As basic immunological science intersects with the practicalities of assuring vaccine safety, tolerability, efficacy, and consistency in the clinic, the practical utility of more sophisticated immunological measures for vaccine development may be determined by whether they can be reduced to simply executed, highly standardized, reproducible assays with outcomes that have clear interpretations for vaccine development and use. Basic immunology, empirical vaccine testing, and regulatory science are all necessary contributors to developing the next generation of vaccines, including vaccines effective against the pathogens for which vaccines are not currently available.",1
"For recovery from infection, the immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) must eliminate or control virus replication without destroying nonrenewable, essential cells. Thus, upon intracellular virus detection, the infected cell must initiate clearance pathways without triggering neuronal cell death. As a result, the inflammatory response must be tightly regulated and unique mechanisms contribute to the immune response in the CNS. Early restriction of virus replication is accomplished by the innate immune response upon activation of pattern recognition receptors in resident cells. Infiltrating immune cells enter from the periphery to clear virus. Antibodies and interferon-γ are primary contributors to noncytolytic clearance of virus in the CNS. Lymphocytes are retained in the CNS after the acute phase of infection presumably to block reactivation of virus replication.",1
"The immune system is highly receptive to endocrine signals due to the expression of hormone receptors on immune cells. The impact of this immune–endocrine cross talk and related immune responses becomes clearly evident when assessing immunity from a sex-specific perspective. We here describe the effect of hormones, primarily sex- and stress-related steroid hormones, on cells of the innate and adaptive immune system in men and women. We specify how these effects are operational throughout the life span and also during periods of dramatic hormonal changes, such as pregnancy.",1

"Domestic buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) of swamp type (for draught) and river type (for milk) dominate the tropical Asia with slightly more than 169.4 million. They breed throughout the year and produce two calves every 3 years and are fed mainly on straw, crop residues, and mineral supplements. Assisted reproductive technologies such as artificial insemination and embryo transfer have also been introduced and implemented in buffalo production with less success due to difficulty in detecting estrus. Providing good feed and feeding remain a challenge in buffalo husbandry due to limited feed resources. With improved management and proper breeding, the milk production from buffaloes has increased from 1500 to 5000 l per lactation. The river type buffalo currently produces about 73.2 million tonnes of milk annually.",1
"The buffaloes reared in the Mediterranean region are the Asian buffalo or water buffalo, that is, Bubalus bubalis. This species includes two types: (1) the river type, with 50 chromosomes, with an adult male weighing between 450 and 1000kg and with an annual milk production of 1000–3000kg; and (2) the swamp type, with 48 chromosomes, with an adult male weighing between 325 and 450kg and with an annual milk production of up to 600kg. The river buffalo is reared mainly for milk, whereas the swamp buffalo is reared mainly for draught. Only 3% of the world buffalo population is reared in the Mediterranean region. Significant numbers of buffaloes are at present found only in Italy, Romania, Egypt, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Iraq and Iran. In all these countries, buffaloes represent only a very small portion of total livestock, except in Egypt, where buffaloes are more numerous than cattle. Because of the strong market demand for buffalo cheese, the number of buffaloes has increased in Italy and there is a preference for buffalo dairy products compared to cows’ milk products in a few countries. Major morphological differences between the buffalo populations of different countries include (1) the variable size, ranging between a minimum of 280 and 300kg liveweight for adult females and males, respectively, in Egypt to a maximum of 900 and 1000kg in Iraq, the most frequent weights being 600 and 800kg; (2) the shape of the horns; and (3) the coat color, from dark gray and dark brown to black, showing white spots in some cases.",1
"Raising replacement dairy kids begins with prenatal care of the doe. The doe needs to be properly vaccinated before kidding, be in proper body condition, and have good nutrition, including vitamins and minerals. A program to prevent caprine arthritis encephalitis must be instituted, which involves removal of the kid from the doe at birth, feeding heat treated colostrum the first day of life, and feeding with milk replacer, heat treated milk, or a mixture thereafter. Milk should be fed generously (3 times a day) to 2 weeks of life. Milk consumption can become limited by feeding 0.5l per feeding, twice a day. More milk can be fed, by feeding 3 times a day or using acidified or cold milk procedures. A high-quality starter feed should be fed beginning the second week of life. A kid must be a minimum of 6 weeks of age to be weaned, weigh at least 10kg, and have a starter intake of at least 250gday-1. Kids can be transitioned to weaning by reducing milk feeding to one time a day. After weaning, the kid should be fed 360g of starter feed per day and all of the high-quality hay they can eat. The kid should gain 150gday-1 from birth and weigh 35kg by 7 months of age when they can be bred. Kid health problems can be prevented by consumption of adequate colostrum, well-ventilated environment, avoiding crowding, and good sanitation. Attention needs to be given to making gradual changes in feeding.",1
"Rearing replacement heifers is part of herd survivability and represents 15–20% of total farm costs. Proper attention to the growth of heifers is paramount to producing heifers that achieve adequate stature and body weight before first breeding and calving. Timely entry of heifers into the milking herd by 2 years of age, or their first eligible calving season in seasonal pasture-based dairy enterprises, can be facilitated by applying synchronization of estrus and ovulation in addition to traditional detection of estrus by visual or other means. Because fertility is better in heifers than in lactating cows, artificial insemination of heifers with semen from the best available progeny-tested bulls is a wise investment to ensure genetic gain of economically important traits. Annual culling rates of 25–33% necessitate a supply of herd replacement heifers. Application of gender-biased semen to produce more female offspring is also warranted for increasing the replacement population. The main goal of a heifer replacement program is to develop heifers at minimal cost and in a timely manner to obtain heifers of desired size and body weight so that they attain puberty, establish pregnancy, calve easily, and achieve their maximum genetic lifetime milk production as cows.",1
"Replacements are the future of the dairy industry. Focusing on improving health management of replacements will yield tremendous returns through decreased losses of animals with the greatest genetic potential on the dairy, decreased costs of medication, improved growth rates, improved feed efficiency and earlier entry into the milking herd. Health management begins before replacements are born with attention to the nutrition of lactating and dry cows, the vaccination of lactating and dry cows, control of length of the dry period and both control of the disease status of the dams and the cleanliness of the calving environment. Adequate consumption of colostrums by newborn calves is very important. Attention must be paid to biosecurity to prevent introduction of diseases into the herd and to digestive disorders such as diarrhea, internal parasites and appropriate vaccination programs for the calves. Health management of replacements is often overlooked because producers do not see the immediate returns for their efforts.",1
"Astroviruses are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses. Their genomes contain three open reading frames, but the exact number of encoded proteins remains unknown. Astroviruses were originally identified in association with childhood diarrhea; subsequently, they have been identified as a common enteric virus infecting children under the age of 2. Infection is not restricted to humans, however, and host-specific astroviruses have been found in association with a variety of mammalian and avian species. Generally, infection causes a mild, self-limiting gastroenteritis, although infection in chickens and ducklings can result in nephritis or severe hepatitis, respectively. The immune response to astrovirus infection is only poorly characterized and may differ between mammalian and avian species. In this article, the current knowledge of astroviruses is reviewed, including their molecular virology, viral evolution, pathogenesis, and immune response.",1
"Coronaviruses have the largest known RNA genomes (∼30kb), which are of positive sense. Together with toroviruses, they are classified in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales. All coronaviruses have four common proteins, three in the envelope and one associated with the genome. Assembly of virus particles occurs at internal membranes. The genes for the structural proteins are at the 3′ end of the genome. Most of the genome (∼20kb) is gene 1, which encodes 15–16 proteins associated with RNA replication and transcription. Translation of gene 1 involves ribosomal frameshifting. Transcription is by a discontinuous process which results in a 3′ co-terminal nested set of mRNAs, each of which has a common leader sequence transcribed from the 5′ terminus of the genome. Only the most 5′-proximal gene of each mRNA is translated. Recombination is a feature of coronavirus evolution. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has resulted in the discovery of more coronaviruses in humans, other mammals, and avian species, and the realization that the host range of coronaviruses is wider than previously acknowledged. Coronaviruses are associated with a wide range of diseases, including the respiratory and enteric systems, though not necessarily restricted to these, for example, some coronaviruses affect the central nervous system, kidneys, and gonads. The most widely used coronavirus vaccine (billions of doses annually) is against infectious bronchitis virus, which affects chickens.",1
"In the last two decades, a large number of new viruses have been discovered, many of which are pathogenic in humans or other vertebrates. Among the more important causes of virus emergence have been changes in human behavior, population, and increases in travel to distant countries. In addition, the application of new molecular technologies has led to the recognition of many viruses that hitherto went undetected. Many of the new, emerging viruses have an RNA genome, and many are zoonoses. The spread of human immunodeficiency virus, causing acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and the use of immunosuppressive drugs following transplant surgery, have increased the numbers of people in the population that are highly susceptible to emerging virus infections. The threat of a new pandemic of influenza virus in the human population stresses the need for development of better methods for detection, surveillance, and control of emerging virus diseases.",1
"Many viruses use the enteric tract as a route of entry to the human, animal, or avian host. The onset of acute enteritis is associated with infection by viruses that replicate at or near the site of entry into the intestinal mucosa, including caliciviruses, rotaviruses, adenoviruses, astroviruses, and coronaviruses. These ‘enteric’ viruses occur globally and share similar features. Most are RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of mature absorptive epithelial cells lining the villi of the small intestine, leading to inflammation and villus atrophy. Vomiting and diarrhea can result in dehydration and death if untreated. Despite abundant growth in vivo, they initially proved difficult or impossible to grow in vitro. Most are genetically diverse, species specific, highly infectious within species and transmitted by the fecal–oral route. Severe symptoms are most commonly associated with primary infections of young animals, and are followed by short-lived immunity. Reinfections are common throughout life, but are often only mildly symptomatic. Safe and effective vaccines have been developed to prevent severe rotavirus disease in young children. In addition to these enterotropic viruses, enteric disease can also result from spread to the intestine of HIV or cytomegaloviruses during the later stages of systemic disease in immunocompromised hosts.",1
"The eye contains a variety of cell and tissue types. Conjunctivitis due to respiratory RNA viruses represents by far the most common viral eye disorder. However, any ocular tissue can sustain infection by human viruses, including those viruses with predilection for neural sites. As elsewhere in the body, ocular pathologic changes induced by viruses tend to follow stereotypical patterns. Classical viral mechanisms of infection, including latency, reactivation, and carcinogenesis, can all be demonstrated in the eye. The eye's tissues also demonstrate a wide variety of immune responses, including those of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue and immune privilege. The ocular complications of AIDS, including viral retinitis and ocular surface squamous carcinoma, remain significant causes of morbidity throughout the world.",1
"Viral pathogens impact both wild and farmed fish. In some cases, outbreaks of these diseases in populations of fish can lead to the near extinction of a particular race of sockeye salmon or such severe losses as to put commercial aquaculture ventures out of business. The importance of fish viruses to the aquaculture industry has increased the number of reported new virus isolations and the host range of previously characterized viruses. Currently, the fish viruses are represented in 14 of the families listed for vertebrate viruses by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses. The fish viruses containing DNA genomes are listed in the families Iridoviridae, Adenoviridae, and Herpesvirdae and those with RNA genomes are listed in the families Picornaviridae, Birnaviridae, Reoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Caliciviridae, Togaviridae, Nodaviridae, Retroviridae, and Coronaviridae. Many of these viruses have grown optimally at the temperature of the host (8–15°C). A few of the viruses can cross the species barrier and infect other fish species, cattle, pigs, and humans. As the need of aquacultured fish grows and the industry brings into culture more diverse species of fish, it is likely that there will be new virus isolations and some will be subsequently classified as new genera or even families.",1
"Paramyxoviruses (some of which are also called parainfluenza viruses) cause a wide variety of diseases in animals. Many paramyxoviruses cause primarily respiratory disease, while others cause serious systemic disease. Many diseases caused by animal paramyxoviruses also have a neurological component or a reproductive disease component. Several of the most devastating diseases of animals, such as rinderpest, Newcastle disease, and canine distemper, are caused by paramyxoviruses. Some of the animal paramyxoviruses, such as the Hendra and Nipah viruses, are emerging zoonotic pathogens of major public health concern. New paramyxoviruses are being isolated on a continuing basis from a wide variety of animals. All animal paramyxoviruses belong to the family Paramyxoviridae. The members of this virus family are enveloped and have genomes consisting of a single segment of negative-sense RNA that contains 6–10 genes encoding up to 12 proteins. Although there are many animal paramyxoviruses, only a few effective vaccines are currently available. In the last decade, methods of producing many animal paramyxoviruses entirely from cDNA clones (reverse genetics) have been developed. This has not only greatly improved our understanding of the molecular biology and pathogenesis of these viruses, but has also made it possible to engineer improved vaccines for them.",1
"Viruses are the leading causes of acute lower respiratory-tract infection in infancy. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common pathogen, with hMPV, PIV-3, influenza viruses, and rhinoviruses accounting for the majority of the remainder of acute viral respiratory infections. Humans generally do not develop lifelong immunity to reinfection with these viruses; rather, specific immunity protects against severe and lower respiratory-tract disease.",1
"Virus taxonomy is a man-made field of science aiming at helping the classification of viral entities and at using the same nomenclature for the description of these entities in their biological and physical properties. Taxonomy at the interface of conceptual and physical matters is by essence very controversial, but it is important for many purposes from virus diagnostics to virus evolution. Virus taxonomy, which officially began in 1966 under the activity of 43 virologists who created the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), has made tremendous progress in the last 40years to classify today about 6000 virus entities into more than 2000 species, themselves classified into 287 genera, 73 families, and 3 orders, as attested by the Eighth Report of the ICTV. Virus nomenclature has also progressed in parallel to virus taxonomy, and although virologists still debate about the best way to write virus species names, undoubtedly virus taxonomy and nomenclature are now in a very advanced state. However, major challenges are ahead for virologists with the exponential increase in virus genome sequencing which will be beyond 1million sequences by 2010 and the virologists have to face that challenge with organization and creativity, in order to offer to the virological community the best and most useful virus taxonomy and nomenclature.",1
"Toroviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses with a peplomer-bearing envelope that have been associated with enteric disease in cattle and possibly humans. Toroviruses appear to occur worldwide, and torovirus-like particles in fecal preparations have been reported from Europe, the Americas, Asia, New Zealand, and South Africa. These viruses have a unique C-shape or open torus morphology in the extracellular environment. There are four recognized species in the genus Torovirus (family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales): Equine torovirus, Bovine torovirus, Human torovirus, and Porcine torovirus. Among them there is little genetic divergence (20–40%). Antigenic cross-reactivity has revealed a relationship between equine torovirus (EToV), bovine torovirus (BToV), and human torovirus (HToV). The torovirus genome contains six open reading frames (ORFs), which are transcribed as a 3′ co-terminal nested set of four mRNAs. ORF1a and -1b encode the replicase, and ORFs 2–5 encode the spike (S), membrane (M), hemagglutinin-esterase (HE), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, respectively. EToV is apathogenic, and the only torovirus that has been grown in vitro. All BToV strains are pathogenic, causing diarrhea in experimentally or naturally infected calves. HToVs have been associated with gastroenteritis and diarrhea in children, as well as with nosocomial infections in infants with necrotizing enterocolitis.",1
"Many viruses are surrounded by a continuous bilayer membrane studded with viral proteins. Its purpose is to protect the genome-containing virus nucleocapsid from damage, and to facilitate entry of the nucleocapsid into a host cell. Viral membrane proteins attach the virus to the host cell, and promote fusion between viral and host cell membranes. Enveloped viruses form by a budding process, involving the wrapping up of newly synthesized nucleocapsids with regions of host cell membranes containing host cell lipids but exclusively viral proteins. Host cell machinery and processes are co-opted by enveloped viruses for use at every stage of these viral events.",1
"The family Arteriviridae, which consists of four small, enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses, was established in 1996. The current members are Equine arteritis virus (EAV), Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and Simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV). Because arteriviruses share with coronaviruses a similar genome organization, conserved replicase motifs, and a common genome expression strategy, which includes a mechanism of discontinuous RNA synthesis to generate multiple subgenomic RNAs, they have been joined in the order Nidovirales. However, arteriviruses differ from coronaviruses in the smaller size of their genomes, the smaller size and morphology of their virions, and the properties of their structural proteins. The arteriviruses each have distinct narrow host ranges but are widely distributed geographically. Transmission of arteriviruses occurs via the respiratory route or via bodily fluids and in all cases their primary target cells are macrophages. The outcomes of infections with the different arteriviruses range from asymptomatic infections that can be either persistent or acute, to abortion, respiratory disease, arteritis, fatal hemorrhagic fever, and poliomyelitis. Mechanisms that are thought to contribute to persistence include masking of the primary neutralization epitope by glycosylation, the generation of neutralization escape variants, infection of macrophages by immune complexes via Fc receptors, and the presence of an immunodominant decoy epitope near the primary neutralizing epitope.",1
"Genetic recombination of viruses is a commonly found phenomenon in both DNA and RNA viruses. By exchanging of fragments of genetic material viruses gain important means leading to both variability and also to the repair of their genome. Biochemically, the processes of DNA and RNA recombination are different reflecting the specifics of DNA versus RNA replication as well as their use inside the cell. A variety of recombination mechanisms are discussed and illustrated by examples taken from specific viral species.",1
"The use of viral agents for biological warfare has a long history, which predates their recognition and isolation by culture. Advances in viral culture and virus stabilization made during the second half of the twentieth century raised the level of concern by facilitating the large-scale production of viral agents for aerosol dissemination. Furthermore, the nucleic acid of many viruses, including some that are currently not threats, can be manipulated in the laboratory. Thus, the potential for genetic engineering and misuse of biotechnology is a serious threat. An effective defense against viral agents requires a comprehensive approach including restricting access to viral stocks, detecting deliberately induced disease outbreaks, rapid laboratory identification of viral agents in clinical specimens, preventing person-to-person transmission, using reliable decontamination procedures, and developing effective vaccines and antiviral drugs.",1
"Viruses are among the most common causes of opportunistic infection after solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SOT and HSCT). Viral infection is associated with both direct (invasive disease) and indirect (immune modulation) effects affecting susceptibility to other infections and promoting allograft rejection. The transplantation recipient is susceptible to a broad array of viral pathogens. Some may be transmitted with the allograft as donor-derived infections, while others result from exposure, either soon after the transplant or from more distant exposures when infection is latent and reactivates in the setting of immune suppression. Simultaneous infections with multiple viral or viral and nonviral pathogens are common. The risk for viral infection is a function of the intensity of exposure and virulence of the specific virus, the intensity of immune suppression used to prevent graft rejection or graft-versus-host disease, underlying immune deficits, and factors affecting host susceptibility. Studies of viral latency, reactivation, and of the cellular effects of viral infection will provide clues for future strategies in prevention and treatment of viral infections. This article covers specific issues relating to viral infection in SOT and HSCT; additional details regarding these viral infections are also found elsewhere in this text.",1
"Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) is the type member of the genus Comovirus, which comprises one of three genera of the family Comoviridae. The genome of CPMV consists of two molecules of positive-strand RNA, which are separately encapsidated in isometric particles consisting of 60 copies each of two types of coat protein. Since its initial isolation, CPMV has been extensively studied from both a genetic and structural point of view and has become a paradigm for plant viruses that express their genome through the synthesis and processing of precursor polyproteins. In this regard, as well as in its particle structure, CPMV resembles other members of the family Picornaviridae. More recently, the virus has been used for a number of biotechnological applications.",1
"Virus laboratory diagnostics has an increasingly important role in modern patient care. Virological methods are needed to investigate the etiology of acute viral infection or the reactivation of a latent infection, as well as to follow virus load in antiviral treatments. Serological assays are also used for screening of blood products for the risk of certain chronic infections, evaluation of the immune status, and need for prophylatic treatments in connection with organ transplantations. For diagnostic purposes the following approaches can be used: demonstration of presence of infectious virus or its structural components directly from a patient's specimens or investigation of specific antibody response in serum specimes. Virus isolation is used to demonstrate infectious virus in a patient's specimens, whereas nucleic acid amplification techniques, like polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are widely used to detect virus nucleic acids. Virus antigens are investigated by antigen detection assays. Serological diagnosis is based on either the demonstration of the presence of virus-specific IgM antibodies or a significant increase in the levels of specific IgG antibodies. Immunoassays are the most commonly used serological assays. Point-of-care tests (POC tests), both for antigens and antibodies, are also becoming more and more common in diagnostic use. In order to reach the best diagnostic efficiency for each patient it is important to select the most suitable method using the right sample collected at the right time.",1
"The notion about immunity to disease arose from the observation that those who recovered from an apparently contagious disease became resistant to a subsequent similar sickness. Much later it was shown that immunity is transferable by serum. The active serum components were identified to be immunoglobulins (Ig's), called antibodies. The enormous diversity of antibodies specific for distinct viruses, pathogens, and many other antigens is explained by clonal selection, whereby specific B-lymphocyte receptors recognize a particular antigen. The selected B-cells are triggered to undergo replication. A process of further cell differentiation and maturation ensues, leading to secretion of antibodies with high binding affinity toward the triggering antigen. Genes coding for the variable regions (involved in antigen binding) of Ig's are inherited as sets of gene fragments joined to form a complete gene in individual B-cells. This process and further hypermutations ensure the synthesis of diverse high affinity antibodies. The antibodies consist of pairs of light (L) and heavy (H) polypeptide chains. Variations in the constant portion of H-chains lead to production of Ig isotypes (IgM, IgA, IgD, IgE, and IgG (further subdivided into IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4)), each having distinct effector functions. Host exposure to viruses leads to the production of antibodies with more than one specificity. Only some of these antibodies, recognizing so-called virus neutralization epitopes, diminish or eliminate virus infectivity. Other virus-specific antibodies play auxiliary roles or are ineffective. Sometimes antibodies cause enhancement of viral diseases or play a role in evasion of the immune system. Many antiviral immunoglobulins are being used for short-term pre-exposure prophylaxis or therapy. Long-term protective effects can be accomplished only by antibodies elicited by successful vaccination relying on the phenomenon of immunological memory. T-lymphocytes play a major role in initiating and maintaining immunity against subsequent virus exposure. Antibodies are one of the essential features of antigen triggered adaptive immunity. Initial early defense against viruses is provided by components of innate immunity which evolutionarily precedes adaptive immunity, and remains an essential part of defense against pathogens in humans.",1
"The new technologies of genomics, proteomics, and molecular immunology have led to an impressive increase in our knowledge of all aspects of virology, providing insights that can guide new vaccine concepts. When developing a new vaccine, the choice of approach is made very much on a case-by-case basis, and for a given virus is driven by knowledge its pathogenesis, serotype diversity, antigenic variation, immune evasion mechanisms, latency and route of transmission. High importance is given to what type of immunity arises as a result of natural infection and whether the pathogen can cause persistent and/or repeated infections in a single host. This article discusses the medical need for new human viral vaccines and focuses on the strategies available for their development and some of the challenges posed by the more difficult targets.",1
"The concept of ‘innate immunity’ embraces all sorts of measures that exclude, inhibit, or slow down infections with little specificity and without adaptation or generation of a protective memory. The mammalian innate immune defenses described in this article comprise the complement system, nonspecific phagocytic and cytolytic leukocytes (macrophages, monocytes, granulocytes, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells), and cytokines such as the antivirally active type I interferons. Since the type I interferon (IFN-α/β) system is our primary defense against viral infections, special attention will be paid to the virus-triggered induction of IFN transcription, the signaling activated by IFNs, and the antiviral factors expressed as a consequence.",1
"Membrane fusion of enveloped viruses with cellular membranes is mediated by viral glycoproteins, which are activated by proteolytic cleavage and/or interaction with cellular receptors. Fusion entails extensive conformational changes of the fusion protein that initially anchors to cellular membranes thus bridging two bilayers. Further refolding into a hairpin-like structure pulls viral and cellular membranes into close proximity to permit lipid bilayer fusion. Refolding provides the energy for fusion, which follows several defined lipidic intermediate states occurring concomitantly with refolding. Although different classes of fusion proteins use different structural motifs, the principle of repositioning both membrane anchors, the transmembrane and the fusion peptide region, at the same end of an elongated hairpin structure generated by receptor binding is maintained in all known viral fusion protein structures, suggesting that they follow similar principles to achieve lipid bilayer fusion.",1
"Current techniques for viral detection and discovery, which include culture and serological methods as well as polymer chain reaction (PCR)-based protocols, possess a variety of inherent limitations. In an effort to augment the capabilities of existing diagnostic methodologies, the use of virus-specific DNA microarray technology has been recently applied in both research and clinical settings with favorable results. The primary advantage of this approach is that DNA microarrays containing literally thousands of virus-specific sequences allow simultaneous testing for essentially all known viral species. While previous methods have been limited to testing for a single pathogen, or small numbers of specific pathogens, a panviral assay is less biased and can be designed to detect variant or even novel members of existing viral families. The use of DNA microarrays in both research and clinical settings has the potential to substantially increase the number of instances in which a virus may be identified in biological samples. With the proper bioinformatics methodologies, this technology will also maximize the probability that previously uncharacterized pathogens are detected potentially leading to an improved understanding of the etiology for many chronic human diseases. This article focuses on all aspects of virus-specific DNA microarray implementation, from array design to sample processing, amplification, and data analysis.",1
"The study of virus evolution has historically been concerned with disease and its emergence and has not been integrated into the general study of evolution. Yet viruses dominate our planet and their evolution is a broad and applied field that can be studied in the real time (such HIV in human disease) and can also be applied to biotechnological problems. Virus evolution is very similar, but not identical, to host evolution. Darwinian principles apply, such as with Fisher population genetics, but other features, such as reticulated and quasispecies-based evolution, distinguish virus evolution. In RNA viruses, high error rates have led to the quasispecies concept in which collective populations are the basis of evolution. These populations provide viruses with high capacities for adaptation. Yet some RNA viruses show remarkable evolutionary stability. With DNA viruses, especially of bacteria, extensive recombination defines vast dynamic and ancient genetic pools. Temperate viruses can directly affect host gene pools by stable colonization. DNA viruses can be genetically complex and have evolved many unique viral genes. The retroviruses show both quasispecies-based rapid evolution and host-linked slow coevolution (e.g., endogenous retroviruses). Thus, virus evolution impacts all life and viral emergence continues to threaten human health.",1
"Biological species, including viruses, change through generations and over time in the process known as evolution. Viruses may evolve at high, uneven, and fluctuating rates among genome sites. The accumulated changes, through either mutation or recombination with other species, are first fixed in the genome of successful individuals that give rise to genetic lineages. The relationship between biological lineages related by common descent is called ‘phylogeny’. For inferring phylogeny, the differences between aligned sequences of genomes and proteins are quantified and depicted in the form of a tree, in which contemporary species and their intermediate and common ancestors occupy, respectively, the terminal nodes, internal nodes, and the root. The tree is characterized by a topology, length of branches, shape, and the root position. A complex mathematical apparatus has been developed for phylogeny inference that can evaluate inter-species differences, facilitate tree building and comparison of trees, and assess the fit between data and tree through, typically, computationally intensive calculations. A reconstructed tree is an approximation of the true phylogeny that practically remains unknown. The phylogenetic analysis is used in applied and fundamental virus research, including epidemiology, diagnostics, forensic studies, phylogeography, evolutionary studies, and virus taxonomy. It can provide an evolutionary perspective on variation of any trait that can be measured for a group of viruses.",1
"Virus-induced gene silencing and viral suppression of gene silencing was first described in plants using plant poty- and potexviruses. This research began by a few laboratories has burgeoned into a larger field of study surrounding the role of small 21–25nt RNAs in modulating disease and development. Gene silencing is often referred to as an antiviral defense mechanism producing siRNAs which target viral genomes for degradation. Many viruses encode silencing suppressor proteins which function to block production of siRNAs or the ability of siRNAs to reach their targets. miRNAs are small RNAs which regulate development and nuclear gene expression. Recent studies have shown that viruses manipulate the miRNA pathway in a manner that alters host gene expression, sometimes causes developmental defects, and modulates disease symptoms.",1
"As tools and technologies for the analysis of biological organisms (including viruses) have improved, the amount of raw data generated by these technologies has increased exponentially. Today's challenge, therefore, is to provide computational systems that support data storage, retrieval, display, and analysis in a manner that allows the average researcher to mine this information for knowledge pertinent to his or her work. Every article in this encyclopedia contains knowledge that has been derived in part from the analysis of such large data sets, which in turn are directly dependent on the databases that are used to organize this information. Fortunately, continual improvements in data-intensive biological technologies have been matched by the development of computational technologies, including those related to databases. This work forms the basis of many of the technologies that encompass the field of bioinformatics. This article provides an overview of database structure and how that structure supports the storage of biological information. The different types of data associated with the analysis of viruses are discussed, followed by a review of some of the various online databases that store general biological, as well as virus-specific, information.",1
"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses with characteristic spike glycoproteins that project outward like the rays of the sun (corona – Latin for ‘crown’), when visualized by electron microscopy. CoV are classified, together with the toroviruses, in the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales. All nidoviruses have a common genome organization and generate a nested set (nido – Latin for ‘nest’) of 3′ co-terminal mRNAs. CoVs have been isolated from a variety of species, including birds, livestock, domestic animals, and humans. CoV infections can cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurologic disease, depending on the strain of the virus and the site of infection. Importantly, CoVs have been shown to cross species barriers and have emerged from animal reservoirs to infect humans and cause severe disease. The CoV responsible for an outbreak of severe acute respiratory disease (SARS-CoV) in 2002–03 likely originated as a bat coronavirus which, during replication in an intermediate host (such as the palm civet), evolved to be able to infect humans efficiently. SARS-CoV infected over 8000 people with approximately 10% mortality rate. The SARS-CoV outbreak was controlled by public health measures alone. However, emergence or re-emergence of CoV from animal reservoirs is a potential concern for public health.",1
"Nidoviruses form a phylogenetically compact but diverse group of enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses with the largest RNA genome known. They infect a broad range of hosts, including humans, other mammals, birds, fish, and shrimp. Nidovirus infection starts by binding to a receptor on the cell surface, and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes mediated by one of the major surface glycoproteins. Following genome uncoating, the translation of the two overlapping replicase open reading frames (ORFs) yields two large polyprotein precursors that undergo autoproteolysis to produce the mature nonstructural proteins that eventually assemble into a membrane-bound, replication–transcription complex. The complex, which also contains several cellular proteins, mediates negative-strand RNA synthesis, amplification of the genome RNA, and production of a nested set of subgenomic messenger RNAs (sg mRNAs). Whereas nidovirus genome replication proceeds through the synthesis of a full-length negative-strand RNA, transcription involves the synthesis of subgenome-length, negative-strand templates for mRNA synthesis. In arteriviruses and coronaviruses, and probably bafiniviruses, transcription involves a mechanism of discontinuous negative-strand synthesis (template switch) to equip each subgenomic RNA with a 5′ common leader sequence identical to the genomic 5′ end. Except for the largest torovirus sg RNA, torovirus and ronivirus sgRNAs do not share such a common leader sequence and discontinuous RNA synthesis does not appear to be involved in this case. New nidovirus particles are assembled in the cytoplasm. There is increasing evidence that nidovirus infections modify a variety of host cell functions and structures, and induce a variety of immune and stress responses.",1
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new human disease caused by an animal coronavirus that adapted to efficient human-to-human transmission. The disease first emerged in November 2002 in Guangdong Province, China and spread globally within months. The SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV) affects multiple organ systems with severe viral pneumonia as its main clinical manifestation but with diarrhea, lymphopenia, and mild liver dysfunction being common extra-pulmonary manifestations. Increasing age and the presence of underlying respiratory diseases worsens the prognosis. Unlike other respiratory viral infections, transmission of SARS was less frequent in the first 5days of illness and correlated with low viral load in the upper respiratory tract at this stage of the illness. This fortuitous feature of the disease allowed the public health measures of case detection and patient isolation to interrupt virus transmission in the community and abort the SARS outbreak. Bats are a reservoir of a virus closely related to SARS CoV and this may be the likely precursor from which the human-adapted SARS CoV emerged. Small mammals such as ‘civet-cats’ (Paguma larvata) within live animal markets in southern China serve as amplifiers of infection and these markets were the likely interface where zoonotic transmission occurred. The viral spike protein is necessary and sufficient for inducing protective antibody responses and has been a key target in the development of candidate vaccines.",1

"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the fundamental concepts, terminology, and practice of pathology as the discipline dedicated to the understanding of causes, mechanisms, and effects of diseases. It describes some key terms, definitions, and concepts, presents historical human approaches to diseases, and provides an overview of current diagnostic practice and a vision for new interface with applied molecular biology. Pathology refers to the specialty of medical science concerned with the cause, development, structural/functional changes, and natural history associated with diseases. Disease refers to a definable deviation from a normal phenotype (observable characteristics due to genome and environment), evident via patient complaints (symptoms), and/or the measurements of a careful observer (signs). The cause of the disease is referred to as its etiology. One disease entity can have more than one etiology, and one etiology can lead to more than one disease. Each disease entity develops through a series of mechanistic chemical and cellular steps. This stepwise process of disease development is referred to as its pathogenesis. Pathogenesis can refer to the changes in the structure or function of an organism at the gross/clinical level and the stepwise molecular abnormalities leading to changes in cellular and tissue function. The presentation of a disease to a clinician is in the form of a human patient with variably specific complaints (symptoms), to which the examining physicians can add diagnostic sensitivity and specificity by making observations (screening for signs of diseases).",1
"Publisher Summary Pulmonary pathology includes a large spectrum of both neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases that affect the lung. Many of these are a result of the unusual relationship of the lung with the outside world. Every breath that a human takes brings the outside world into the body in the form of infectious agents, organic and inorganic particles, and noxious agents of all types. Although the lung has many defense mechanisms to protect itself from these insults, these are not infallible; therefore, lung pathology arises. Damage to the lung is particularly important given the role of the lung in the survival of the organism. Any impairment of lung function has widespread effects throughout the body, since all organs depend on the lungs for the oxygen they need. Pulmonary pathology catalogs the changes in the lung tissues and the mechanisms through which these occur. This chapter presents a review of lung pathology and the current state of knowledge about the pathogenesis of each disease. It suggests that a clear understanding of both morphology and mechanism is required for the development of new therapies and preventive measures.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the various diseases transmitted by blood transfusion. This transfusion transmitted diseases (TTD) can be caused by viruses, protozoa and prions. The mitigation of transfusion transmission of infectious agents is mentioned to be based on donor selection and donor testing. A table is presented that illustrates the potential transfusion transmitted agents. Hepatitis viruses are transmitted through transfusion and result in inflammation of the liver, jaundice, hepatomegaly and anorexia and both hepatitis B and hepatitis C typical hepatitis viruses transmitted through transfusion. Several other viruses transmitted through transfusion of infected blood include human immunodeficiency virus, human t-cell lymphotropic virus and herpesviruses. The protozoans transmitted due to transfusion include Plasmodium, Trypanosoma and Leishmania. Prion diseases results from the benign form of the prion protein changing to an insoluble protease-resistant form, which leads to the formation of plagues in the brain. Another transfusion transmitted disease called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) is described.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter describes how the impact of psychological trauma differs depending upon the social and cultural context and the social and cultural resources available to individuals, families and communities. Disadvantaged persons and communities such as those experiencing poverty, stigma and discrimination, disabilities, homelessness, political repression, communal/societal violence (including military and gang warfare), forced immigration (refugees), interrogation and torture, terrorism, genocide and catastrophic disasters are particularly vulnerable both to being exposed to traumatic stressors and to developing postrraumatic stress disorder and associated psychiatric disorders and psychosocial problems. This vulnerability largely is explained by the presence of chronic stressors (such as stigma, discrimination and poverty) and exposure to chronic or particularly horrific traumatic stressors (including the often lengthy aftermath of catastrophic disasters or societal conflicts), rather than being due to ethnic or cultural differences.",1
"Publisher Summary Initially, the availability of molecular diagnostics was considered a panacea, but replacement of conventional tests for detection and identification of microorganisms by molecular procedures eventually gathered momentum. This chapter describes current state-of-the-art molecular diagnostics and comparative genomics in medical microbiology to provide an understanding of infectious disease over the coming years. Nucleic acid-based tests are being introduced with increasing speed into routine clinical microbiology laboratories. Some of the problems remaining to be solved prior to general acceptance of nucleic acid-mediated detection and identification of microbial pathogens are reviewed. Historic objections are slowly being taken apart, and an accelerated introduction of molecular diagnostics is being pursued in many cases. Clear improvement in clinical testing is achieved by introducing molecular tests. Therefore, swift introduction of such tests into clinical practice is important to be pursued. Several PCR tests show increased sensitivity, excellent specificity, and cost effectiveness highlighting the success of the novel applications in the field of bacterial infections. Finally, some of the problems remaining to be solved prior to general acceptation of nucleic acid-mediated detection and identification of microbial pathogens are also reviewed.",1
"Publisher Summary The safe operation of a laboratory that focuses on biomedical research is difficult. No single source of information can provide all the information and guidance necessary to develop an adequate safety program/plan to protect laboratory personnel from various hazards. Most countries and provinces have regulations related to safety precautions that may need to be followed by laboratories. This chapter draws attention to general considerations concerning safety approaches in biomedical research laboratories in the United States. The operation of biomedical research laboratories requires attention to many complex issues that depend on the goals and activities of each specific laboratory. All laboratories should consider issues in physical, electrical, and fire safety. Safety can be maintained with the careful evaluation of all safety incidents and modification of the safety plan to prevent similar incidents. Regulations specify approaches necessary to protect employees from blood-borne pathogens, general laboratory chemicals, and specific chemicals such as formaldehyde. All employees need to work in order to maintain a safe working environment. This requires establishing a safety infrastructure, developing and monitoring of an effective safety plan, and imparting information about safety hazards associated with special types of laboratory work: biohazards, chemical hazards, and radiation hazards.",1
"Publisher Summary A large number of clinically important viruses utilize carbohydrate viral surface protein interactions to propagate infection and disease. The identification and structural characterization of the proteins and glycans essential in these recognition phenomena opens up new avenues for both drug discovery and vaccine development. This chapter describes some of the most significant developments in the field of structure-based investigations of viral surface-resident carbohydrate-recognizing proteins. Specifically, an overview of these carbohydrate-recognizing proteins from four important human viruses, including influenza, dengue, rotavirus, parainfluenza, and associated structural investigations will be presented. The surface of flavivirus is predominantly covered by E-glycoprotein (EGP) that forms dimers tethered to the surface by a stalk region. The EGP-associated glycan of the virus has been shown to be important for Dengue virus infection. Both human parainfluenza viruses and Newcastle disease virus have a surface-resident carbohydrate recognizing protein known as hemagglutinin-neuramindase (HN), which is involved in both cellular recognition and as a receptor-destroying enzyme. Influenza virus neuraminidase (NA) is a glycosylated homo-tetramer that is tethered to the virus surface by a long protein stalk at its C terminal.",1
"Publisher Summary The calcium-dependent lectin dendritic cell-specific ICAM-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) is involved in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) interactions with dendritic cells. Attachment of HIV to dendritic cells can potentiate viral infectivity for adjacent T-cells and it has been postulated that this process contributes to the dissemination of sexually transmitted virus. More recent research has revealed that the consequences of lectin-dependent HIV interactions with dendritic cells are diverse and can include uptake for major histocompatibility complex presentation, productive infection, and transfer of virus to T-cells. This chapter introduces DC-SIGN and other cellular lectins known to recognize HIV, and discusses how lectin binding might impact viral dissemination. An intricate interplay between viruses and C-type lectins impacts the balance between viral attack and host defense, as specified below for HIV, and elucidation of the underlying mechanisms can provide important insights into the pathogenesis of viral infections and may uncover attractive targets for therapy and prevention.",1
"Publisher Summary Dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN). DC-SIGN is a C-type lectin receptor that recognizes N-linked high-mannose oligosaccharides and branched fucosylated structures. It is now clear that the biological role of DC-SIGN is two-fold. It is primarily expressed by dendritic cells and mediates important functions necessary for the induction of successful immune responses that are essential for the clearance of microbial infections, such as the capture, destruction, and presentation of microbial pathogens to induce successful immune responses. Yet, on the other hand, pathogens may also exploit DC-SIGN to modulate DC functioning thereby skewing the immune response and promoting their own survival. This chapter presents an overview of the structure of DC-SIGN and its expression pattern among immune cells. The current state of knowledge of DC-SIGN-carbohydrate interactions is discussed and how these interactions influence dendritic cell functioning is examined. The molecular aspects that underlie the selectivity of DC-SIGN for mannose-and fucose-containing carbohydrates are detailed. Furthermore, the chapter discusses the role of DC-SIGN in dendritic cell biology and how certain bacterial pathogens exploit DC-SIGN to escape immune surveillance.",1
"This chapter treats two main topics: the relationship between human health, aquatic ecosystems, and water use; and the necessity of interdisciplinary approaches for the development of water management policies and disease control. Main waterborne diseases, mostly affecting developing countries and relevant in terms of water management and changes in land use, such as malaria, schistosomiasis, or cholera, are discussed stressing links to the global water crisis. Also, the role of artificial and natural wetlands in influenza epidemics is treated. The effects of increasing water use and scarcity on human health are discussed considering historical and contemporary incidence of diarrheal diseases in European and South Asian megacities, relationships between dams and on waterborne diseases in Asia and Africa, and intensive agri- and aquaculture resulting in man-made ecotones, fragmented aquatic ecosystems, and pathogen mutations. It is emphasized that the comprehension of the multiple interactions among changes in environmental settings, land use, and human health requires a new synthesis of ecohydrology, biomedical sciences, and water management for surveillance and control of waterborne diseases in basin-based, transboundary health systems. Surveillance systems should monitor changes in water management, ecotones, and hydrological cycles and shifts in, for example, the outbreak timing of strongly seasonal diseases. These indicators would provide criteria for the development of innovative water management policies, combining methods of vector control and the safe creation of water reservoirs, irrigation systems, and wetland habitats.",1

"The current status of isotope-assisted multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for protein structural studies is reviewed. After introducing various classic isotope labeling methods, some new emerging technologies, such as the stereo-array isotope labeling method, are described. The concomitant development of advanced stable isotope labeling strategies, NMR instrumentation, sophisticated NMR measurements, spectral analysis, and structural calculation algorithms is essential to overcome the current limitations restricting the use of protein NMR spectroscopy.",1
"Human infectious disease is classified into five etiologies: bacterial, viral, parasitic, fungal, and prion. Viral infections are unique in that they recruit human cellular machinery to replicate themselves and spread infection. The number of viruses causing human disease is vast, and viruses can be broadly categorized by their structures. Many viruses, such as influenza, appear to be amorphous particles, whereas others, such as herpes simplex virus, rhinovirus, dengue virus, and adenovirus, have roughly symmetric structural components. Icosahedral viruses have been a target of electron microscopists for years, and they were some of the first objects to be reconstructed three-dimensionally from electron micrographs. The ease with which highly purified and conformationally uniform virus samples can be produced makes them an ideal target structural studies. Apart from their biological significance, these virus samples have played a pivotal role in the development of new methodologies in the field of molecular biology as well as in cryo-electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomography.",1
"Among thousands of homo-oligomeric protein structures, there is a small but growing subset of ‘domain-swapped’ proteins. The term ‘domain swapping,’ originally coined by D. Eisenberg, describes a scenario in which two or more polypeptide chains exchange identical units for oligomerization. This type of assembly could play a role in disease-related aggregation and amyloid formation or as a specific mechanism for regulating function. This chapter introduces terms and features concerning domain swapping, summarizes ideas about its putative mechanisms, reports on domain-swapped structures collected from the literature, and describes a few notable examples in detail.",1
"A crucial interplay between protein conformations and lipid membrane energetics emerges as the guiding principle for the regulation and mechanism of membrane fusion in biological systems. As some of the basics of fusion become clear, a myriad of compelling questions come to the fore. Is the interior of the fusion pore protein or lipid? Why is synaptic release so fast? Why is PIP2 needed for exocytosis? How does fusion peptide insertion lead to fusion of viruses to cell membranes? What role does the TMD play? How can studies on membrane fission contribute to our understanding of membrane fusion? What exactly are SNARE proteins doing?",1

"Publisher Summary The need to better understand host–pathogen interactions has risen with the expansion in genomics and related technologies. This chapter focuses on two aspects of the host response to pathogens where major advances are being made using genomic approaches. The availability of complete genomic sequences of an expanding number of pathogens, the human and mouse genome sequences, and the advent of genome-wide genotyping and gene expression profiling has opened up new avenues of investigation in the field. The genotype of the pathogen plays a major role in the response of the host to infection with more virulent pathogenic strains possessing the capability to interfere with the host immune response. In addition, different individuals in a population can have very different responses to a genetically identical pathogen. Part of the differential response is governed by the underlying genetic differences between individuals. The advent of genome-wide genotyping using single nucleotide polymorphisms or microsatellite markers is leading to major advances in molecular epidemiology. The future impact of genomic approaches on the development of diagnostics and therapeutics is discussed for infectious diseases. This includes defining the basis of genetic susceptibility to infection and system-wide molecular response to a pathogen.",1

"The nervous and immune systems are two complex physiologic systems that are functionally shaped by the integration of both genetic factors and experience. Although these systems are usually studied in isolation from each other, these two systems are highly interactive and cross-regulate the functions of each system. Therefore, disruptions in these normal neuroimmune interactions likely contribute to a broad array of neurologic and neurodegenerative disorders.",1
"The clinical features, pathology, and pathogenesis of the major acquired and inherited diseases involving peripheral and central nervous system myelin are described with an emphasis on the existing knowledge of the neurochemistry relevant to these diseases and areas for future investigation.",1
"The region of a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule that precedes the coding sequence of a gene is called the ‘leader sequence’. This region is also known as the ‘five prime untranslated region’ (Figure 1) of the mRNA. Leader sequences have the propensity for forming secondary structures (stem-loops) by base pairing of complementary sequences. They are involved in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. In eukaryotes, the leader sequence may vary from few nucleotides to more than 1000 nucleotides. In prokaryotes, the leader sequences are usually short and at times contain an attenuator segment that is translated to a short-leader peptide. The leader peptide functions to terminate transcripts before the RNA polymerase reaches the first structural gene of the operon. The leader sequences in viruses have been shown to play an important role in the regulation of gene expression, replication, and pathogenicity. Mutations in the leader sequences of cellular mRNAs can have implications for disease and tumorigenesis.",1

"The foundations of the science of medical virology are intertwined with the other life sciences, particularly microbiology and infectious diseases. Medical virology has a relatively brief history, spanning just over a century, but it is crowded with intriguing discoveries, stories of immense personal courage and numerous practical applications, many of which have had an overwhelmingly positive benefit on humankind. Its origins involved the replacement of centuries-old beliefs and theories with discoveries borne out of rigorous scientific investigation. Targeted prevention and control strategies could only be developed and implemented once the concept of the specificity of disease causation had been accepted, namely that infectious diseases are caused not by some common miasma (a mysteriously poisonous substance), but rather by specific agents. In a wider sense, the microbial sciences have played a pivotal role in the development of medical thought, particularly in applying scientific rigor in understanding pathological processes. Advances in understanding of infectious agents have led to improvements in human health and well-being that arguably have exceeded the contribution of any other branch of science. Indeed, many workers in this field have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in recognition of their achievements.",1
"The taxonomy of viruses represents a unique classification system that recognizes boundaries among at first sight a continuum of properties. Genome sequencing has brought into sharp debate the origin of viruses, with RNA viruses perhaps having a separate evolutionary lineage. The criteria adopted for assessing the causal linkage between virus and disease deviates from those normally adopted for bacterial diseases and reflects those unique properties that underlie the principles of virus classification.",1
"Pathogenesis encompasses all the sequence of events accompanying acute and persistent infections. It includes entry of the virus into the body, multiplication and spread, the development of tissue damage, and the production of an immune response; the latter may contribute to the pathology of an infection. It includes the appearance of clinical signs and symptoms, the eventual resolution of the infection and, in most cases, virus elimination. Understanding viral disease pathogenesis requires knowledge of each of the stages of infection and an awareness of the underlying mechanisms. There may be variation from individual to individual in the severity and/or the duration of these events, but a sound working knowledge of a typical sequence associated with each infection is crucial in both making an accurate diagnosis and recommending the appropriate treatment.",1
"An accurate virus diagnosis invariably requires laboratory testing of clinical specimens for the presence of virus, viral antigens, or specific antibodies. The past few decades have seen a major revolution in the operation of virus diagnostic laboratories and in their role in clinical patient management. Virus isolation has been largely replaced by sensitive nucleic acid detection assays and the measurement of specific antibodies at a very high level of sensitivity and specificity.",1
"Over the past 20 years, antiviral therapy has undergone a revolution and is now making a significant impact on the treatment of major virus diseases, for example HIV and viral hepatitis B and C. Targets include viral reverse transcriptases and proteases. The use of interferon to boost host immunity has also proved effective. Our understanding of chemotherapeutic strategies and drug resistance has become considerably more sophisticated since the widespread introduction of routine genome sequencing of virus isolates.",1
"Epidemiology is the study of the distribution, the dynamics, and the determinants of diseases in populations. The risk of virus infection and/or clinical disease is determined by characteristics both of the virus, and the levels of innate and acquired resistance in the community. Virus transmission is affected by behavioral, environmental, and ecological factors. Knowledge of these factors contributes to evidence-based policy decisions as to how best to control and prevent virus diseases. Considerable use of genome sequencing of isolates now provides useful information as to the identification of outbreak sources as well as informing the design and testing of candidate vaccines.",1
"Emerging viral diseases now represent a major concern worldwide with the appearance of a new virus, or the re-emergence of a previously recognized virus with altered epidemiology and properties, occurring almost annually. Prominent examples in the last years include the sudden crossing of H5N1 avian influenza virus into humans in 1995, the unexpected West African outbreak of Ebola virus in 2014, the appearance of the Middle East respiratory syndrome related to the SARS virus first recognized in 2003, and the more recent epidemic of Zika virus in the Americas. These are just a few examples representing the constantly evolving relationship between pathogen and host, a process of evolution accelerated by population growth, climatic changes, and human activities.",1
"Coronaviruses possess a distinctive morphology, the name being derived from the outer fringe, or “corona” of embedded envelope protein. Members of the family Coronaviridae cause a broad spectrum of animal and human diseases. Uniquely, replication of the RNA genome proceeds through the generation of a nested set of viral mRNA molecules. Until 2003, coronaviruses attracted little interest beyond causing mild upper respiratory tract infections. This changed dramatically in 2003 with the zoonotic SARS-CoV and the more recent emergence of MERS-CoV has confirmed the coronaviruses as significant causes of severe respiratory disease.",1

"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the animal virology that defines human development, which is shaped by at least three major recurring elements: environmental changes, human conflicts, and infectious diseases. It states that the origins of veterinary medicine are rooted in efforts to maintain the health of animals for food and fiber production and animals essential for work-related activities. The early phase of virology was one of skepticism and uncertainty because of the limited tools available to define the filterable agents. Even with filtration, there were differences among the agents as to their size as defined by filter retention. The bacterial viruses assisted in defining some of the basic principles of genetics through the study of mutations and the inheritance of phenotypic changes. Veterinary virology began as a discipline focusing on the effects of viral infections on animals of agricultural significance. Control of these infections relied on advances in understanding the disease process, in the characterization of the viruses, in the development of the fields of immunology and diagnostic technologies, and in the establishment of regulations controlling the movement of production animals. Initial experiences confirmed that eradication of some infectious diseases from defined areas could be achieved with a test and slaughter program, even in the absence of an effective vaccine. This chapter also explores characteristics of viruses, viral morphology, and taxonomy.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter describes virus replication. Before the development of in vitro cell culture techniques, all viruses had to be propagated in their natural host. For bacterial viruses, this was a relatively simple process that permitted an earlier development of laboratory research methods than was possible with plant or animal viruses. For animal viruses, samples from affected animals were collected and used to infect other animals, initially of the same species. When consistent results were obtained, attempts were usually made to determine whether other species might also be susceptible. This chapter explains that the advent of in vitro animal cell culture brought research studies in line with those involving bacterial viruses, thereby reducing the risks associated with adventitious viruses in animal inoculation systems and enhancing diagnostic testing. Various in vitro cell culture systems are used since an artificial medium was developed to maintain cell viability outside the source species: organ cultures, explant cultures, primary cell cultures, and cell lines. Organ cultures maintain the three-dimensional structure of the tissue and are used for short-term experiments. A fundamental characteristic that separates viruses from other replicating entities is the manner in which new virus particles are synthesized. Viruses do not use binary fission; virus particles are assembled de novo from the various structural components synthesized as somewhat independent but synchronized events. The critical first step in the virus replication cycle is the binding of the virus particle to a host cell. This binding process may involve a series of interactions that define in part the host range of the virus and its tissue/organ specificity.",1
"Publisher Summary Viruses first infect their host, then spread, and then damage their target tissues. To ensure their perpetuation, viruses must be transmitted to other susceptible individuals—that is, they must be shed with secretions or excretions into the environment, be taken up by another host or a vector, or be passed congenitally from mother to offspring. Viruses have developed a remarkable variety of strategies to ensure their own survival. Individual viruses cause their associated diseases through a considerable variety of distinct pathogenic mechanisms. Viruses differ greatly in their virulence, but even in a population infected by a particular virus strain, there are usually striking differences in the outcome of infection of individual animals. Similarly, there is much variation among viruses of the same species, and the determinants of viral virulence are often multigenic, meaning that several viral genes contribute to the virulence of individual viruses. The determinants of host resistance/susceptibility are usually multifactorial and include not only a variety of host factors but environmental ones as well. There is wide variation in the virulence of viruses, ranging from those that almost always cause inapparent infections, to those that usually cause disease, to those that usually cause death. Meaningful comparison of the virulence of viruses requires that factors such as the infecting dose of the virus and the age, sex, and condition of the host animals and their immune status be equal; however, these conditions are never met in nature, where heterogeneous, outbred animal populations are the rule and the dynamics of exposure and viral infection are incredibly varied.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter argues that antiviral immunity in animals is mediated by both cellular and humoral factors, and the nature of the immune response generated by different individuals infected with the same virus can be different, depending on the individual's genetic constitution, environmental influences, and other factors that can determine the course and pathogenesis of the infection. Innate immune defenses exhibit neither antigen specificity nor memory, but they provide a critical line of first defense against viral infections because they are constantly present and are operational immediately after viral infection. Innate immunity is often considered separate from acquired immune responses, but they are inextricably linked, and innate responses modulate subsequent acquired responses in many ways. Viruses that are transmitted horizontally between individuals must first breach the barriers at their portal of entry before they can cause infection in their respective hosts. In the ongoing war and détente between virus and host, viruses have developed remarkably sophisticated mechanisms to avoid the various host protective responses. Vaccination is the most effective way of preventing viral diseases. There are some important differences between vaccination practices in humans and animals. The immunogenicity of inactivated vaccines, especially that of purified protein vaccines and synthetic peptides, usually needs to be enhanced; this may be achieved by mixing the antigen with an adjuvant, incorporation of the antigen in liposomes, or incorporation of the antigen in an immunostimulating complex.",1
"Publisher Summary Specific diagnoses of a viral infection are described in this chapter that are generally of five types: those that demonstrate the presence of infectious virus; those that detect viral antigens; those that detect viral nucleic acids; those that demonstrate the presence of an agent-specific antibody response; and those that directly visualize the virus. Most available routine tests are agent dependent—that is, they are designed to detect a specific virus and will give a negative test result even if other viruses are present in the sample. For this reason, agent-independent tests such as virus isolation and electron microscopy are still used to identify the unexpected or unknown agent in a clinical sample. Traditional methods such as virus isolation are still widely used; however, many are too slow to have any direct influence on the clinical management of an index case. For some economically important viruses, standardized diagnostic tests and reagents of good quality are available commercially; assays have been miniaturized to conserve reagents and decrease costs; instruments have been developed to automate tests, again often decreasing costs; and computerized analyses aid in making the interpretation of results as objective as possible in addition to facilitating reporting, record keeping, and billing. Respiratory diseases, diarrheal diseases of neonates, and some mucocutaneous diseases may be caused by a variety of different infectious agents, including viruses. Rapid and accurate identification of the causative agent can be the basis for establishing a management plan that prevents additional losses in the stable, kennel, flock, or herd.",1
"Publisher Summary Epidemiology is the study of the determinants, dynamics, and distribution of diseases in populations. The risk of infection and disease in an animal or animal population is determined by characteristics of the virus, the host and host population, and behavioral, environmental, and ecological factors that affect virus transmission from one host to another. Epidemiology, which is part of the science of population biology, attempts to meld these factors into a unified population-based perspective. The word epidemiology is widely used now no matter what host is concerned; the words endemic, epidemic, and pandemic are used to characterize disease states in human populations, and enzootic, epizootic, and panzootic are their equivalents in animal populations. By introducing quantitative measurements of disease trends, epidemiology has come to have a major role in advancing our understanding of the nature of diseases and in alerting and directing disease-control activities. Epidemiologic study is also effective in clarifying the role of viruses in the etiology of diseases, in understanding the interaction of viruses with environmental determinants of disease, in determining factors affecting host susceptibility, in unraveling modes of transmission, and in large-scale testing of vaccines and drugs. The case definition is a critical component of rates and proportions that should be standardized to allow comparison of disease occurrence in different populations and subpopulations. Criteria can be specified for confirmed, probable, and possible cases, depending on whether the selected criteria are pathognomonic for the viral disease of interest and whether laboratory results are available for all cases. Different case definitions can be specified at the individual animal and at the aggregate level.",1
"Publisher Summary Members of the family Paramyxoviridae cause most devastating diseases of animals and humans. In particular, the viruses causing rinderpest, canine distemper, Newcastle disease, measles, and mumps have arguably caused more morbidity and mortality than any other single group of related viruses in history. The impact of these diseases has been dramatically reduced through the use of vaccines in both humans and animals, in combination with depopulation and restrictions on animal movements for diseases such as rinderpest and Newcastle disease. The history of the paramyxoviruses is replete with incorrect reports that complicate their taxonomic classification and confuses assessment of their true ability to cause interspecies infections. The nomenclature of viruses within the family Paramyxoviridae is confusing and fraught with inconsistencies, as individual viruses have variously been named according to their species of origin, geographic sites of discovery, antigenic relationships, or given names related to the diseases that they produce in affected animals or humans. Paramyxovirus virions are pleomorphic, 150–350 nm in diameter. Virions are enveloped, covered with large glycoprotein spikes, and contain a “herringbone-shaped” helically symmetrical nucleocapsid, approximately 1 μm in length and 18 nm (Paramyxovirinae) or 13–14 nm (Pneumovirinae) in diameter. Paramyxoviruses usually cause lytic infection in cell cultures, but adaptation of the virus is usually necessary to achieve high-titer yields of virus.",1
"Publisher Summary Coronavirus and coronavirus-like infections are described in swine, cattle, horses, cats, dogs, rats, birds, bats, rabbits, ferrets, mink, and various wildlife species, although many coronavirus infections are subclinical or asymptomatic. In humans, coronaviruses are included in the spectrum of viruses that cause the common cold and, recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which is a zoonosis. This chapter explains that the family Coronaviridae is included with the families Arteriviridae and Roniviridae in the order nidovirales; viruses in these three families share a distinctive replication strategy. The genus Coronavirus contains a substantial number of pathogens of mammals and birds that individually cause a remarkable variety of diseases, including pneumonia, reproductive disease, enteritis, polyserositis, sialodacryoadenitis, hepatitis, encephalomyelitis, nephritis, and various other disorders. The genus Coronavirus can be subdivided into at least three cluster groups on the basis of genetic and serologic properties, with subgroups in two of these. Group 1a includes transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine, porcine respiratory coronavirus, canine coronavirus, feline enteric coronavirus, ferret and mink coronaviruses, and spotted hyena coronavirus. Group 1b includes certain human coronaviruses, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, and bat coronavirus. Group 2a includes mouse hepatitis virus, bovine coronavirus, sialodacryoadenitis virus of rats, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, canine respiratory coronavirus, and other human coronaviruses. Group 2b includes human SARS coronavirus and civet cat, raccoon dog, and horseshoe bat coronaviruses. Group 3 includes avian infectious bronchitis virus, turkey coronavirus, and several potential but still largely uncharacterized new species from ducks, geese, and pigeons.",1

"The exercise of government powers for the health of its population raises ethical issues, such as public welfare, individual autonomy and freedom, privacy and confidentiality, just distribution of benefits and burdens, transparency, and public accountability. Conflicts among these values often arise and how they should be balanced will vary on a case-by-case basis, weighing costs against benefits.

"When breaches in the species barrier between animals and humans result in crossover of animal infections to humans, the result is an emerging infectious disease. Emerging infections have the potential to cause severe human illness and death, and to spread among human populations and across geographic borders. Direct costs associated with emerging infections are often high, caused by prolonged patient management, hospitalization, and convalescence. Indirect costs are caused by absenteeism from work, death, and permanent removal from the workforce. There may be additional costs if precautionary prevention measures are required, based on the known or potential risk. These costs result from culling and prohibited trade in animals and animal-based products if infected animals are a continuing threat to humans; or from postponement or cancellation of travel and tourism if transmission in the general population is uncontrolled. Emerging infections sometimes cause panic and/or fear because of misunderstanding of the risk, and can lead to actions that result in economic loss similar to that caused by legitimate public health precautionary measures. They include reactions such as avoiding animal-based foods mistakenly thought to be the source of infection; unnecessary cancelling travel plans to avoid geographic areas where there is a perception of risk of infection; and/or unwarranted culling of animals or destruction of animal-based foods. If the misunderstanding is transmitted widely by the press or through social media networks, the negative economic impact can be amplified. Economic loss caused by these perceived risks can generally not be disentangled from the losses causes by public health measures that may be in place, but it is thought that at times they add significantly to the economic burden. The International Health Regulations (IHR) were designed to respond to the international spread of infectious disease outbreaks in a manner that prevents unnecessary negative economic impacts. Agreed by all Member States of the World Health Organization in 2005, they are a legally binding global agreement with the specific purpose of ensuring maximum security against the international spread of diseases, with a minimum interference in world traffic and trade. They reflect current understanding of infectious disease risks, especially those that emerge at the animal/human interface; the realization that infectious diseases cannot be stopped from entering countries at borders; the vast increase in access to information through the internet; and globalization that increases the speed with which infectious diseases spread. Under the IHR, countries are able to work transparently with WHO and its scientific experts and collaborating laboratories to conduct joint risk assessments of public health events such as outbreaks of infectious diseases; to make evidence-based recommendations to help prevent or control their international spread; and, by providing valid and transparent information to national focal points, to help prevent unnecessary panic and misunderstanding about risk.",1

"The World Health Organization (WHO) has been a leading intergovernmental organization in the effort to prevent diseases related to food and improve global food safety and security. These efforts have been focused on the provision of independent scientific advice on foodborne risks, the development of international food standards, through the work of the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission, and the support of Member States through direct policy advice as well as through the creation of laboratory and authority networks sharing experience and building capacity. WHO has also promoted the development and spread of new policy thinking in the food safety area, including especially the introduction of the new risk analysis paradigm, the holistic, farm-to-fork thinking in relation to food production, now often referred to as ‘One Health,’ and finally the focus on simple and efficient messaging toward preventing food risks through a better understanding of good food preparation practices in all sectors.",1
"Food virology is a relatively young but important field in food safety. Viruses in general and human noroviruses in particular, are the leading cause of foodborne disease of known etiology in developed countries. Hepatitis A virus is also important, as are a number of emerging viruses.

It also describes why their transmission is so difficult to control, their detection difficult to achieve, and future research needs that will facilitate their study by food safety scientists.",1
"Foodborne diseases can occur as single cases or outbreaks and sometimes as in the case of cholera spread around the world to cause pandemics. The burden of foodborne diseases is hard to estimate but is in the billions of dollars for loss of life or reduced quality of life, particularly for diseases that are endemic. The bacterial, viral, and parasitic agents cause gastrointestinal symptoms lasting from a few hours to many months, but some agents trigger sequelae that can cause other adverse effects on the body. Everyone is exposed to these types of agents from time to time, but more frequently where there is poor sanitation and lack of temperature control of food, as it occurs in many parts of the developing world.",1

"Enveloped viruses penetrate their cell targets following the merging of their membrane with that of the cell. This fusion process is catalyzed by one or several viral glycoproteins incorporated on the membrane of the virus. These envelope glycoproteins (EnvGP) evolved in order to combine two features. First, they acquired a domain to bind to a specific cellular protein, named “receptor.” Second, they developed, with the help of cellular proteins, a function of finely controlled fusion to optimize the replication and preserve the integrity of the cell, specific to the genus of the virus. Following the activation of the EnvGP either by binding to their receptors and/or sometimes the acid pH of the endosomes, many changes of conformation permit ultimately the action of a specific hydrophobic domain, the fusion peptide, which destabilizes the cell membrane and leads to the opening of the lipidic membrane. The comprehension of these mechanisms is essential to develop medicines of the therapeutic class of entry inhibitor like enfuvirtide (Fuzeon) against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In this chapter, we will summarize the different envelope glycoprotein structures that viruses develop to achieve membrane fusion and the entry of the virus. We will describe the different entry pathways and cellular proteins that viruses have subverted to allow infection of the cell and the receptors that are used. Finally, we will illustrate more precisely the recent discoveries that have been made within the field of the entry process, with a focus on the use of pseudoparticles. These pseudoparticles are suitable for high-throughput screenings that help in the development of natural or artificial inhibitors as new therapeutics of the class of entry inhibitors.",1

"The Chinese hamster, also known as the striped-back or gray hamster, is indigenous to Northern Asia. Its small size, polyestrous cycle, short gestation period, and low chromosome number are among the biological attributes that have made it an invaluable laboratory animal for biomedical research. The Chinese hamster first played a role in infectious disease research to type pneumococci strains. It was subsequently used in a variety of infectious disease and epidemiological studies. With early attempts at inbreeding, a hereditary form of diabetes mellitus was identified in the species. The Chinese hamster subsequently became a useful tool for characterizing the metabolic disorder and developing therapies for the human disease. Due to its low chromosome number, Chinese hamster tissue cultures have been a popular research tool for mutagenicity and carcinogenicity studies. During the past 20 years, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells have been utilized to synthesize a wide array of recombinant protein products. Therapeutic proteins derived from CHO cells are currently used to treat numerous human diseases.",1

"Graphical representation and numerical characterization (GRANCH) of nucleotide and protein sequences is a new field that is showing a lot of promise in analysis of such sequences. While formulation and applications of GRANCH techniques for DNA/RNA sequences started just over a decade ago, analyses of protein sequences by these techniques are of more recent origin. The emphasis is still on developing the underlying technique, but significant results have been achieved in using these methods for protein phylogeny, mass spectral data of proteins and protein serum profiles in parasites, toxicoproteomics, determination of different indices for use in QSAR studies, among others. We briefly mention these in this chapter, with some details on protein phylogeny and viral diseases.

The breeding overview is generally limited to taxonomic groups most commonly bred for use in research facilities: macaques, baboons, squirrel monkeys, owl monkeys, and marmosets. For each of these taxonomic groups, the review provides information on typical group compositions; enclosure types; factors used in decisions regarding retention or removal of offspring and breeders; island/semi-free ranging production systems, if relevant; Specific-Pathogen-Free colony production and management, if relevant; and population management, including expected production figures. Pregnancy management is described in more detail, primarily for macaques and marmosets, including methods to detect ovulation and pregnancy, tracking of prenatal growth and development, maternal changes during pregnancy, and prevalence and causes of prenatal mortality. Finally, an overview of acquisition of nonhuman primates from foreign breeding programs is provided.",1
"Viral infections pose a potential threat to the health of laboratory and zoological colonies of nonhuman primates as well as the personnel involved in their care. This chapter discusses those viral diseases of importance to nonhuman primates and their caregivers by taxonomic family to which the causative agent is classified. A doctrine of comparative virology is that infection of the immunocompetent, appropriate host often is associated with minimal disease, whereas infection of the inadvertent susceptible host can have devastating consequences. The likelihood of such transmission is increased when changes in the environment place different species in close proximity. Similarly, transmission of viral agents from nonprimate host to primate host may result in severe disease. Perhaps of equal importance is the realization that experimental manipulations may inadvertently expose animals to unrecognized pathogens with lethal consequences. For instance, a number of minimally pathogenic viruses may cause severe disease in animals immunosuppressed from pharmacologic manipulation or immunodeficient from concurrent infection with viruses that target the immune system. Numerous examples of each of these scenarios are documented within this chapter.",1
"Respiratory diseases are among the most important problems affecting nonhuman primate husbandry, especially among newly imported and outdoor-housed primates. Respiratory diseases are also a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in wild populations. Respiratory problems can affect the nasal passages and paranasal sinuses, the laryngeal air sacs, the larynx, trachea bronchi, and lung parenchyma (including vasculature and alveoli) and may be caused by direct infection with a variety of agents, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites, as well as by noninfectious, inflammatory stimuli such as particulates, allergens, pneuotoxins, and endogenous inflammatory mediators. Many of the respiratory pathogens reported in this chapter also affect humans or are of human origin (zoonotic or anthropozoonotic). This chapter reviews comparative respiratory anatomy and physiology as well as the diseases affecting all components of the respiratory system of nonhuman primates.",1

"Public health professionals are considering how molecular medicine applications can impact on preventive medicine and health provision enabling interventions to start earlier. There is the potential for molecular medicine to improve the workplace although inappropriate use will lead to discrimination. The public health issue of communicable diseases is being addressed through molecular medicine in more effective and early detection and a better understanding of pathogenesis. A threat from emerging and re-emerging infections requires multiple approaches but early and definitive detection will need nucleic acid based approaches. The non-communicable diseases are now a global world problem, particularly obesity. While molecular medicine is still to make a significant impact on this disorder some interesting findings are emerging about the role of genes in obesity. Ultimately, global health issues must include more efficient and environmentally sustainable strategies. Molecular technologies provide a promising approach for the way forward.

"Publisher Summary This chapter describes the state of the art machineries that viruses use from viral infection (entry) to the end stage, when new, progeny virus particles disseminate from cells. The development of drugs that target dynein activities during viral replication rely on the disruption of characterized and specific interactions between viral proteins and dynein. Because viruses are parasitic in nature, great reason exists to fully understand the molecular mechanisms underlying host cell protein function and viruses’ dependence on these for additional rounds of infection. Some viral infections induce the assembly of stress granules, including reovirus and respiratory syncytial virus, but others block their assembly during infection. Considering this dependence on dynein activity for assembly, it is possible that viruses co-opt factors of the dynein motor complex during infection, but as a consequence either induce or silence stress granule assembly. This is an emerging field of endeavor, but stress granules and other silencing ribonucleoprotein bodies may represent “dangerous” areas and structures of the cell that viral replication complexes, proteins, and RNAs/DNAs would need to avoid guaranteeing expression and survival. There is research support for the presence of both dynein and kinesin motors driving viral components toward assembly sites. Several viruses, including poxviruses and the vaccinia virus, replicate in cytoplasmic virus factories. Paradoxically, regulatory genes of various viruses enhance and disrupt microtubule integrity and polarization, but this may directly relate to the timing of the replication cycle. This is an area yet to be explored.",1

"Publisher Summary This chapter reviews methods of isolating, identifying, and tracking viruses with potential applications to microbial forensic investigations. Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on earth. These obligate parasites infect every form of life, from archaea and eubacteria to fungi, plants, and animals. Viruses play key roles in global ecology—they form a vast reservoir of genetic diversity, influence the composition and evolution of host populations, and affect the cycling of chemical compounds through the environment. Research has focused on the tiny fraction that causes disease in humans, domestic animals, and crops; sequencing surveys have suggested that the majority of viruses are completely unknown. The ability of viruses to jump species barriers, move between habitats, and circle the globe rapidly underscores the importance of continued vigilance for naturally emerging or deliberately engineered outbreaks. Viruses are extremely simple “life” forms without metabolic capacity, organelles, translational machinery, or autonomous replicative potential. Virus particles constitute a minimal set of components, primarily those required to deliver the genome to the target cell and initiate replication. Consequently, virus particles (or virions) are extremely small, most in the range of 20 to 200 nm in diameter. Virions are diverse not only in size but also in composition, morphology, and genome characteristics. Virus particles may be irregular in shape or possess a distinct symmetry, such as helical or icosahedral. Particles may be surrounded by a host-derived membrane, termed “enveloped,” or a tight protein shell, termed “nonenveloped.”",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter illustrates central elements of the host response in a simplified fashion and describes a few representative examples that have a high potential of providing evidence. It may aid an investigation to distinguish a perpetrator from a victim who has been exposed to a particular microorganism or by-product, such as a toxin. Considerable advances have been made in the forensic analysis of microbes and toxins. These advances include sequencing, genomics, and microscopy. An underdeveloped and underutilized area in microbial forensics is how the host interacts with microorganisms in a way that provides unique signatures for forensic use. For investigative and forensic purposes, an immediate goal is to distinguish a potential victim and innocent person from a perpetrator and to distinguish between a naturally acquired or intentional infection. Two principal methods that are sufficiently developed are characterization of the humoral immune response and identification of vaccine-induced immunity or antibiotics that may be present in a possible perpetrator. The primary aims of a microbial forensics investigation are to identify the biological agent, its source, and the individuals responsible for the event. Analytic approaches differ when the suspected biothreat agent is encountered in a container or the environment, as opposed to in vivoin a human, animal, or plant. Analyses of trace elements, pollens, growth media, latent fingerprints, and microbial and nonmicrobial nucleic acids are all applicable to the container and environmental sample.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter addresses issues associated with the identification of signatures based on genomic DNA/RNA, which can be used to identify and characterize pathogens for biodefense and microbial forensic goals. Genomic signature-based identification techniques have the advantage of being precise, highly sensitive, and relatively fast in comparison to biochemical typing methods and protein signatures. Classic biochemical typing methods were developed long before knowledge of DNA and resulted in dozens of tests that are used to roughly characterize the major known pathogens. Genomic signatures can be intended for many different purposes and applied at multiple different resolutions. Organism signatures are intended to uniquely identify the organisms involved. Mechanism signatures can be best thought of as identifying particular genes that result in functional properties such as virulence, antibiotic resistance, or host range. The primary reason to identify mechanisms, independent of organisms, is to detect potential genetic engineering. A secondary reason is that nature has shared many important mechanisms on its own over the millennia, and thus they may not be sufficiently unique to identify specific organisms. Method signatures present yet another dimension of analyzing pathogens: evidence of potential bacterial genetic engineering may be seen in a genome by checking for traces of the bacterial vectors that may have been used to insert one or more foreign genes and related components into the genome being modified.",1
"Publisher Summary The threat posed by terrorism remains many years ahead. Bioterrorism remains a real threat, but because actual incidents remain at a low level, complacency is a constant enemy; hence the continuing background of false alarms may indeed be beneficial, encouraging responding agencies to keep practiced and alert. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) model of an integrated intelligence and forensic approach is a useful model for other nations of similar size or maturity to consider as a measured contribution to a whole of government approach to threats posed by bioterrorism. The Australian microbial forensic capability is reliant on the combined and coordinated efforts of numerous government facilities, departments, and agencies within law enforcement and public health at the state, territory, and commonwealth levels, as well as the private sector. It is a shining example of how a coordinated effort can provide a comprehensive capability that does well to protect the Australian community. The AFP and Australian Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Data Center also work closely with international law enforcement partners in the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. The contribution of these and other international partners can be understated in the ongoing united effort to protect the citizens and assets of Australia and other countries against bioterrorism.",1
"Publisher Summary Disciplines related to microbial forensics are evolving rapidly. This evolution includes technology, analytical capabilities, and, equally as important, education and training. The scientific bases, applications, interpretations, and lessons learned by those who have been intimately involved in the early years of microbial forensics need to be documented and transferred to the next generation of scientists and decision makers so that we can protect society from potential harm resulting from bioterrorism and biocrime. The burgeoning field of microbial forensics should be accompanied by a parallel development of educational infrastructure and resources targeted at the next generation of practitioners, as well as diverse elements for the policy, research, and law enforcement communities. A microbial forensics education program can be broad, providing information encompassing all aspects of the field from science to policy, or more focused depending on its purpose and target audience. Policy makers must have a general understanding of microbial forensics results and better appreciation of their implications in order to effect sound and defensible policy decisions. Finally, an important group that informs the public and government is the news media. They are frequently the primary interface between the scientist and the public, making their observations, insights, or inaccuracies of great importance and impact. Educational efforts will better prepare such individuals to be informed and responsible and must be varied in depth and scope to match the target audience of various entities involved in microbial forensics.",1

"Meticulous study design, exacting scientific review, scrupulous data management, rigorous human subjects protection, and effective recruitment strategies are essential components of all clinical research studies that must be in place prior to the conduct of the study. Equally important to the success of the study and to the well-being and protection of study participants is the assurance that safe clinical environments are provided for the care of research participants. This chapter describes approaches to managing clinical care and clinical research quality in clinical research, as well as the application of established health care-based clinical quality methods and tools to the complex processes of clinical research. Techniques for identifying clinical risks, tools for collecting data about the quality of clinical care processes, and strategies for measuring the participants' perceptions of the research process are discussed in detail.",1
"The clinical laboratory can play a useful role in a clinical research program at multiple levels including assistance in developing a laboratory test menu during protocol design, often focused on identifying testing approaches that address specific research questions. Laboratory staff also can provide important input in test performance and test result interpretation in the setting of the specific research questions. In addition, the laboratory can collaborate with investigators in identifying available test methods or developing new testing that will be useful answering specific questions raised in the protocol. Finally, the clinical laboratory can provide important support in translating research questions into new laboratory methods that may not only be useful for the protocol but that may mature into alternative diagnostic or therapeutic applications for patient care. As a model, we outline the approach taken in our laboratory in support of clinical research performed at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center.",1
"Globalization, ease of travel, potential for spread of epidemics as well as widening health disparities between developed and resource-limited countries have made the need to conduct clinical research internationally a necessity. This reality calls for understanding the challenges and obstacles that can impact project outcome that must be overcome, to acquire new knowledge and disseminate evidence-based interventions to reduce global health disparities and inequities. These challenges include lack of an in-country skilled workforce, deficient infrastructure for research, inefficient health care system to support clinical research, poor data management, as well as inadequately structured institutional ethics boards and poor regulatory oversight. Investment in human capital development through training of research personnel, mentoring, increased support for research administration, engaging leaders in a community-engaged research partnership model prior to project initiation and wise use of technology for effective communication will promote robust clinical research in regions of the world where clinical research productivity historically has been exceedingly low.",1

"Gene–environment interactions likely account for a large portion of the “missing heritability” or “dark matter” of genetic associations with traits and diseases.

"Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on the Nidovirales order whose member families include Arteriviridae, Coronaviridae, and Roniviridae. The nidoviruses genome is an infectious, linear, positive sense RNA molecule, which is capped and polyadenylated. Based on the genome size, they are divided into two groups large and small nidoviruses. The genomes of the large nidoviruses are well over 25 kb in length with size differences in the 5 kb range. Based on the genome size, they can be distinguished into two groups, large and small nidoviruses. The genomes of the large nidoviruses are well over 25 kb in length with size differences in the 5 kb range. Although the structural proteins of the nidoviruses are generally functionally equivalent, there is no firm indication that any single protein species is evolutionary conserved across all of the families. Members of the family Coronaviridae generally possess three or four envelope proteins. The most abundant one is the membrane (M) protein. Though different in sequence, the M proteins of corona-, toro-, and bafiniviruses are alike in size, structure, and presumably also in function. Nidoviruses have lipid envelopes, which are commonly acquired by budding at membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, intermediate compartment and/or Golgi complex. In coronaviruses, the S protein is an important target for T cell responses and is the major inducer of virus-neutralizing antibodies, which are elicited by epitopes located mostly in the N-terminal half of the molecule.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on Coronaviridae family whose two subfamilies include Coronavirinae and Torovirinae. The member genera include Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, Torovirus, and Bafinivirus. The members of the family Coronaviridae are enveloped and positive stranded RNA viruses of three classes of vertebrates, which include corona- and toroviruses for mammals, coronaviruses for birds, and bafiniviruses for fishes. The nucleocapsids are helical and can be released from the virion by treatment with detergents. Where the coronavirus nucleocapsid appears to be loosely wound, those of the Torovirinae are distinctively tubular. The entire replication cycle takes place in the cytoplasm and involves the production of full-length and subgenome-sized (sg) minus-strand RNA intermediates with the viral genome serving both as mRNA for the replicase polyproteins and as a template for minus-strand synthesis. Members of the family Coronaviridae all seem to share two envelope protein species, the membrane (M) and spike (S) proteins. Similarities in size, predicted structures and presumed function(s) suggest a common ancestry, and the remote, but significant sequence similarities observed for toro-, bafini-, and (to lesser extent) coronavirus S proteins lend further support to this view. The replicase polyproteins of the Coronaviridae comprise a number of characteristic domains arranged in a conserved order.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on Roniviridae family whose sole member genus is Okavirus. The virions are enveloped and bacilliform in shape with rounded ends, where the envelope is studded with prominent peplomers projecting approximately 11 nm from the surface. The nucleocapsids are 20–30 nm in diameter and have a helical symmetry with coil periodicity of 5–7 nm. Long filamentous nucleocapsid precursors occur in the cytoplasm of infected cells and acquire envelopes by budding at endoplasmic reticulum membranes. The virions are sensitive to calcium hypochlorite and sodium dodecyl-sulfate, but sensitivity to other treatments is not known. The virions possess a lipid envelope derived from endoplasmic membranes of host cells. Compared to the genomes of vertebrate nidoviruses, the okavirus genome is unique in that the nucleoprotein gene (ORF2) is located upstream of the glycoprotein gene (ORF3), there is no discrete gene encoding a structural membrane (M) protein, and the virion envelope glycoproteins gp116 and gp64 are generated by proteolysis of a pp3 precursor polyprotein encoded by the ORF3 gene. Okaviruses have been detected only in crustaceans and their geographic range mirrors that of its primary penaeid host, extending across the Indo-Pacific from Eastern Africa, Southern and Southeast Asia, and Australia to islands in the South Pacific. Infections have also been detected recently in blue shrimp (P. stylirostris) from the Gulf of California, and they may be chronic or acute and transmitted horizontally or vertically.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter describes the Tetraviridae family. The virions of the Betatetravirus genus are nonenveloped, roughly spherical, of about 40 nm in diameter and exhibit T = 4 icosahedral shell quasi-symmetry. The genome consists of ssRNA and the viruses in the genus Betatetravirus have monopartite genomes. Betatetraviruses replicate in the cytoplasm and has three distinct types of genomic organization. Most of the members of the group are serologically interrelated but distinguishable. The majority of the isolates were identified on the basis of their serological reaction with antiserum raised against NβV. All the virus species were isolated from Lepidoptera species (moths and butterflies), principally from Saturniid, Limacodid, and Noctuid moths, and no replication in other animals has been detected. In larvae, virus replication is restricted predominantly to the cells of the midgut. With the exception of PrV, no infections by members of the Betatetravirus genus have been achieved in cultured cells, even when gRNA was transfected directly into cells. At high host densities, horizontal spread appears to be the major route of infection. Suggestive evidence exists for vertical transmission, which could be responsible for the observed persistence of tetraviruses within insect populations. The viruses replicate primarily in the cytoplasm of gut cells of several Lepidoptera species. The virons of omegatetravirus genus are nonenveloped, roughly spherical, about 40 nm in diameter and exhibit T = 4 icosahedral shell quasi-symmetry. Unlike viruses in the genus Betatetravirus, viruses in the genus Omegatetravirus have bipartite genomes. As with the betatetraviruses, omegatetraviruses replicate in the cytoplasm and studies in tissue culture cells show that the HaSV replicase is localized within the cytoplasm and associates with membranes derived from the endocytic pathway.",1

"Increasing temperatures and altered precipitation regimes associated with human-caused changes in the earth s climate are having substantial impacts on ecological systems and human well-being. Maintaining functioning ecosystems, the provision of ecosystem services, and healthy human populations into the future will require integrating adaptation and mitigation strategies. Adaptation strategies are actions that help human and natural systems accommodate changes. Mitigation strategies are actions that reduce anthropogenic influences on climate. Here, we provide an overview of what will likely be some of the most effective and most important mitigation and adaptation strategies for addressing climate change. In addition to describing the ways in which these strategies can address impacts to natural and human systems, we discuss the social considerations that we believe must be incorporated into the development and application of mitigation or adaptation strategies to address political situations, cultural differences, and economic limitations.",1
"Environments on Earth are always changing, and living systems evolve within them. For most of their history, human beings did the same. But in the last two centuries, humans have become the planet's dominant species, changing and impoverishing the environment for all life on Earth and even decimating humans' own cultural diversity. Contemporary cultural worldviews that have severed humans' ancient connections with the natural world, along with consumption and population growth, have deepened this impoverishment. Understanding, measuring, and managing human environmental impacts – the most important of which is the impoverishment of living systems – is the 21st century's greatest challenge.",1
"Several virus types can contaminate food, with the consequent possibility of human infection. The most common foodborne virus is norovirus, with hepatitis A and hepatitis E viruses also being prominent. Food can be directly contaminated with viruses by infected handlers, and also indirectly by, for example, polluted water used for irrigation or washing. Routine screening of foodstuffs for virus contamination is seldom performed, and may not be wholly cost-effective. Prevention of contamination through risk management of critical control points is more realistic, but physical means of virus elimination will always be required in case of failure of procedural controls. Much research remains necessary before the global challenge of foodborne viruses will be met.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter describes the different RNA viruses that have been detected at least once in parasitoid wasps. It could be wondered whether the other families of parasitoids are really absent, or if this is due to the fact that inadequate techniques were used to detect viruses. In fact, several different methods have been used: TEM of the venom glands of females, extraction of nucleic acids, followed by DNAse digestion to eliminate the polydnavirus or ascovirus genome, RT-PCR with primers specific of RdRp or data mining in an EST library. To resolve this problem of detecting RNA viruses, a systematic search for viruses in parasitoids should be carried out using a combination of these different methods. Only a few hymenopteran species are known to be infected by RNA viruses, although thousands of species are known to carry polydnaviruses or VLPs. This could suggest that the presence of polydnaviruses or VLPs may block infections with other viruses.",1

It has been emphasized since the beginning of the HGP that such effort must not be restricted to the human genome and should include other organisms including mouse, bacteria, yeast, fruit fly, and worm for comparative sequence analyses. A brief history is reviewed in this chapter. Currently, nearly 6000 genome sequencing projects have been reported. The majority of the more than 1000 completed genomes are bacterial sequences (>80%). An important motivation for these efforts is to develop preventative, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies through the analysis of sequenced microorganisms, parasites, and vectors related to human health. A few examples are discussed in this chapter.",1
"Host–vector–pathogen interactions have been governed since their origin by a subtle balance between attack and transmission strategies and defense mechanisms. Dialogues and conflicts are established between a molecular pathogen and its host and will generate a mutual selection pressure that will result in profound changes in gene expression. In the postgenomic era, proteomics is in its infancy, but represents a promising tool to fill the blanks that still exist in biology despite the sequencing of the genomes of many organisms. In this chapter, we present the interest of proteomics in a better understanding of host–vector–pathogen crosstalks through a synthetic review of the available data generated by proteomics studies, discuss the pitfalls of current approaches, and present new approaches to decipher from molecular interactions to population proteomics leading to biomarkers discovery for diagnosis, therapy, and vaccine purposes.",1
"This review explores the broad mechanisms of virus resistance. This will go beyond the generally accepted concept of antiviral resistance by summarizing those evolutionary outcomes that have enabled human viruses to resist mankind’s best efforts at control. The review then focuses on how viruses acquire resistance to compounds that specifically target a virus protein (e.g., polymerase, protease, integrase, sialidase). All viruses have a principle mechanism of acquiring resistance, random point mutations. Those viruses, which have segmented genomes, have an additional mechanism, genetic reassortment. For antiviral compounds that target a key virus enzyme, there is usually a stepwise evolution of resistance. For the therapy of chronic viral infections, such as HIV, the concept of increasing the genetic barrier has been important for optimizing drug combinations for effectively delaying the appearance of resistance. In some cases, the price to the virus for gaining resistance may be reduced “fitness” but there may also be other unexpected effects. Conceptually, one way to avoid virus resistance is to use a compound to target a host protein rather than a viral protein. Such an approach seems to risk causing unacceptable toxicity, however, some instances have been identified where there can be specificity for the virus-infected cell. We end by asking the question, how will viruses respond to such an indirect challenge?",1
"Bioinformatics and the ‘omics’ studies are rapidly changing the way scientific research is conducted. The genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics revolutions all have changed the quantity of the information available and have necessitated the embracement of bioinformatics as an integral part of modern-day science. This is no different in the infectious disease field where, arguably, most genome sequences originate. Here, we present large-scale studies that have resulted in vaccines that would not have been possible using the classical research approach. In addition, we provide an overview of methods available for those venturing into the area of next-generation sequencing.",1
"The last 15 years have seen the emergence of new technologies with very high value for laboratories involved in genomics research or in clinical diagnostics of infectious diseases. In the 1990s, microarray technologies revolutionized bacterial or viral genomes comparisons for the detection of polymorphisms and gene expression profiling. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) platforms are a major breakthrough for genomic research. Because they allow terabase outputs, they have dramatically reduced the times and budgets required to sequence complete genomes compared to classical sequencing. They are invaluable tools for metagenomics and the study of microbes’ flora. They provide extremely powerful alternatives to microarrays for resequencing, gene expression profiling, and epigenomics. The different microarray and NGS platforms have advantages and drawbacks and all require further improvements in terms of data accuracy. They require powerful software solutions to analyze the tremendous amounts of data they generate. Many companies specialized in technologies for genomics analysis have been created since the beginning of the 1990s, many of them as small biotech companies exploiting patents from renowned Universities. Most of them have now been acquired by major in vitro diagnostic companies. Currently, their sales are mostly to research institutes. Translating research to molecular diagnostics for clinical applications in the field of infectious diseases will require further validation of the use of complex sequence data, clinician education, and further efforts from the companies to provide simpler, more robust equipment and reduce the cost of reagents.",1
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is the first major zoonotic infectious disease of the twenty-first century. The disease, originally termed “atypical pneumonia,” was first recognized in November 2002 in Guangdong Province, China, which spread rapidly to 26 countries within 5 months and eventually led to 8096 human infection cases and 774 deaths. A previously unrecognized coronavirus, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was later identified as the causative agent of the SARS. Subsequent investigation indicated that the source of the human infections was most likely originated from infected wildlife animals traded in the live animal markets, with masked palm civets being considered the most prominent and important carrier. Large-scale culling of civets appeared to have prevented further outbreaks in the region. Further epidemiological studies showed that civets are intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV, and bats are the likely natural reservoir of SARS-CoV and a large number of SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs). Detailed analysis of the massive SARS-CoV genomic sequence data accumulated indicated that SARS-CoV experienced a strong selection pressure during different outbreak phases in humans as well as interspecies transmission from animals to humans. The spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV plays a key role in virus–host interaction and hence is a key determinant of interspecies transmission. It has been shown that minor changes of amino acid (aa) residues in the S protein could lead to dramatic changes in virus susceptibility in animal and human hosts. This chapter will focus on the genetics and evolution of SARS-CoVs and SL-CoVs in humans, civets, and bats. The events of SARS outbreaks and the accompanying response activities highlight the importance of modern molecular epidemiology in disease investigation and the urgent need to broaden the screening and investigation of unknown viruses in wildlife animals.",1
"Publisher Summary Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is a gamma-herpes-4-virus and was the first herpes virus to be completely sequenced. Several diseases are associated with EBV, including Hodgkin's and post-transplant lymphomas, oral hairy leukoplakia, and nasopharyngeal carcinomas. EBV has a double-stranded 172-kb DNA genome. Upon infection, the genome circularizes and persists as an episome in infected cells. More than 70 open reading frames exist, which encode proteins expressed during lytic and latent EBV infection. Lytic proteins encode viral proteins, which are necessary for the production of infectious virions, whereas latent proteins are needed to set up persistent infection by transforming and immortalizing host cells. EBV also encodes non-translated RNAs (e.g., EBER1 and EBER2), which are almost ubiquitously expressed and highly abundant in EBV-infected cells. Four EBV latency programs have been described with distinct sets of expressed proteins and viral RNAs: (1) Latency 0: EBER1 and EBER2 but no expression of proteins; (2) Latency 1 (true latency program): EBER1 and EBER2, EBNA1; (3) Latency 2 (default program): EBER1 and EBER2 and expression of EBNA1, latent membrane protein (LMP)-1, LMP2A, LMP2B; and (4) Latency 3 (growth program): EBER1 and EBER2 and expression of EBNA-leader protein (LP), EBNA 2–6, LMP1, LMP2A, LMP2B. The role of most EBV proteins has been characterized mainly in vitro using lymphoblastoid cell lines.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter emphasizes on the structure and complexity of virus genomes. The chapter describes the diversity of virus genomes, and explains the major genetic mechanisms that affect viruses. The chemistry and structures of virus genomes are more varied than any of those seen in the entire bacterial, plant, or animal kingdoms. Virus genome structures and nucleotide sequences have been intensively studied in the recent decades because the power of recombinant DNA technology has focused a lot of attention in this area. The techniques of molecular biology have been a major influence on the virus genome. It is possible to separate the molecular analysis of virus genomes into two types of approaches: the physical analysis of structure and nucleotide sequence, and a more biological approach to examine the structure–function relationships of intact virus genomes and individual genetic elements. The chapter discusses virus genetics and its mutants, genetic and nongenetic interactions among viruses, small and large DNA genomes, positive and negative-strand RNA viruses, and segmented and multipartite virus genomes. Sequences and structures at the ends of virus genomes are in some ways functionally more significant than the unique coding regions within them. Common patterns of genetic organization seen in virus super-families suggest that many viruses have evolved from common ancestors and that exchange of genetic information among viruses has resulted in solutions to common problems.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter begins with an overview of virus replication, and explains how studying bacteriophages has helped understand more complex viruses that are harder to work with, and then explains the processes involved in virus replication step by step. The virus replication involves three broad essential stages carried out by all types of viruses: the initiation of infection, replication and expression of the genome, and the release of mature virions from the infected cell. At a detailed level, there are many differences in the replication processes of different viruses that are imposed by the biology of the host cell and the nature of the virus genome. The other stages that have been discussed are: attachment, penetration, uncoating, genome replication, gene expression, assembly, maturation, and release. The chapter illustrates similarities in the pattern of replication of different viruses. Regardless of their hosts, all viruses must undergo each of these stages in some form to successfully complete their replication cycles.",1
"Publisher Summary Virus pathogenesis is a complex, variable, and relatively rare state. Like the course of a virus infection, pathogenesis is determined by the balance between host and virus factors. Not all the pathogenic symptoms seen in virus infections are caused directly by the virus but are side effects of the immune response. In the past few decades, molecular genetic analysis has contributed enormously in understanding the virus pathogenesis. In the chapter, three major aspects of virus pathogenesis are considered: direct cell damage resulting from virus replication, damage resulting from immune activation or suppression, and cell transformation caused by viruses. The chapter also discusses the mechanisms of cellular injury, virus-induced immunodeficiency, virus-related diseases, bacteriophages, and cell transformation by viruses, retroviruses, and DNA viruses. The chapter ends with a discussion of new pathogenic viruses that are being discovered all the time, and changes in human activities that have resulted in the emergence of new or previously unrecognized diseases.",1

"Antisense technology presents an opportunity to manipulate gene expression within the cells to treat various diseases, and acts as a powerful tool for studying gene function utilizing antisense agents to manage the diseases by regulating the expression of the specific factor that actually causes the particular disease. Highly specific and effective gene silencing of any disease can be achieved by an accurate knowledge of the target mRNA sequence and rational design of its complementary antisense agents for the downregulation of its protein message. This technology has been successfully used for the treatment of cancer, HIV, and other mutating viral diseases. The technology uses agents like antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, short interfering RNA (siRNA), microRNA (miRNA), apatamers, and others. The purpose of this chapter is to survey different antisense technologies and the various mechanisms of gene silencing. The chapter also highlights therapeutic limitations, benefits, clinical applications, and various advances to meet delivery challenges of these agents, and gives due consideration to the regulatory and patent aspects.",1
"More than 250 different foodborne diseases have been described to date, annually affecting about one-third of the world's population. The incidence of foodborne diseases has been underreported and underestimated, and the asymptomatic presentation of some of the illnesses, worldwide heterogeneities in reporting, and the alternative transmission routes of certain pathogens are among the factors that contribute to this. Globalization, centralization of the food supply, transportation of food products progressively farther from their places of origin, and the multitude of steps where contamination may occur have made it increasingly challenging to investigate foodborne and waterborne outbreaks. Certain foodborne pathogens may be transmitted directly from animals to humans, while others are transmitted through vectors, such as insects, or through food handlers, contaminated food products or food-processing surfaces, or transfer from sponges, cloths, or utensils. Additionally, the airborne route may contribute to the transmission of certain foodborne pathogens. Complicating epidemiological investigations, multiple transmission routes have been described for some foodborne pathogens. Two types of transmission barriers, primary and secondary, have been described for foodborne pathogens, each of them providing opportunities for preventing and controlling outbreaks. Primary barriers, the most effective sites of prophylactic intervention, prevent pathogen entry into the environment, while secondary barriers prevent the multiplication and dissemination of pathogens that have already entered the environment. Understanding pathogen dynamics, monitoring transmission, and implementing preventive measures are complicated by the phenomenon of superspreading, which refers to the concept that, at the level of populations, a minority of hosts is responsible for the majority of transmission events.",1
"The term biological warfare typically conjures images of medieval warriors tossing dead cattle over city walls or clandestine government agents secretly releasing mysterious microbes into enemy territory. Of course, biological warfare does encompass such activity, but the vast majority of what constitutes biological warfare is far more mundane. Ever since life evolved on earth about 3.8 billion years ago, organisms have constantly devised new ways to kill each other. Any organism that makes use of toxins—from bacteria to snakes—is engaging in a form of biological warfare. Humans who engage in biological warfare do so by taking advantage of these toxin-producing organisms.",1
"The nucleolus is a dynamic subnuclear body with roles in ribosome subunit biogenesis, mediation of cell-stress responses, and regulation of cell growth. An increasing number of reports reveal that similar to the proteins of animal viruses, many plant virus proteins localize in the nucleolus to divert host nucleolar proteins from their natural functions in order to exert novel role(s) in the virus infection cycle. This chapter will highlight studies showing how plant viruses recruit nucleolar functions to facilitate virus translation and replication, virus movement and assembly of virus-specific ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles, and to counteract plant host defense responses. Plant viruses also provide a valuable tool to gain new insights into novel nucleolar functions and processes. Investigating the interactions between plant viruses and the nucleolus will facilitate the design of novel strategies to control plant virus infections.",1
"ABSTRACT Formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) belong to the classical G protein-coupled chemoattractant receptor family. They are mainly expressed in mammalian phagocytic leukocytes and play important roles in inflammatory and immune responses. N-formyl peptides produced by Gram-negative bacteria were among the first chemotactic factors identified for two FPRs in human beings: FPR1 (originally termed FPR) and FPR2 (originally termed FPRL1). During the past few years, a variety of novel pathogen- and host-derived agonists as well as antagonists for the FPR family have been identified, indicating a broader spectrum of the biological significance of these receptors. Activation of FPRs in leukocytes by agonists induces cell chemotaxis, phagocytosis, release of proinflammatory mediators and gene transcription. Despite these new developments, the in vivo functions of FPRs and their ligands in disease states are not yet fully understood. This chapter summarizes the pharmacological characterization of FPR ligands and their implications in pathophysiological conditions.",1
"ABSTRACT Much evidence supports the notion that angiotensin II (Ang II), the central product of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS), may play a central role not only in the etiology of hypertension but also in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases in humans. Ang II, via the Ang II type 1 receptor, directly causes cellular phenotypic changes and cell growth, regulates the gene expression of various bioactive substances, and activates multiple intracellular signaling cascades in cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts, as well as vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Recently, new factors have been discovered, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, angiotensin-(1-7), and its receptor Mas. This section summarizes the current knowledge about the broad RAS in the pathophysiology of cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling, heart failure, vascular thickening, and atherosclerosis.",1
"Three methods for assembling multiple, overlapping DNA molecules are described. Each method shares the same basic approach: (i) an exonuclease removes nucleotides from the ends of double-stranded (ds) DNA molecules, exposing complementary single-stranded (ss) DNA overhangs that are specifically annealed; (ii) the ssDNA gaps of the joined molecules are filled in by DNA polymerase, and the nicks are covalently sealed by DNA ligase. The first method employs the 3′-exonuclease activity of T4 DNA polymerase (T4 pol), Taq DNA polymerase (Taq pol), and Taq DNA ligase (Taq lig) in a two-step thermocycled reaction. The second method uses 3′-exonuclease III (ExoIII), antibody-bound Taq pol, and Taq lig in a one-step thermocycled reaction. The third method employs 5′-T5 exonuclease, Phusion® DNA polymerase, and Taq lig in a one-step isothermal reaction and can be used to assemble both ssDNA and dsDNA. These assembly methods can be used to seamlessly construct synthetic and natural genes, genetic pathways, and entire genomes and could be very useful for molecular engineering tools.",1
"This chapter discusses the causes of indoor pollution as well as the rise of building-related illness (BRI) and sick building syndrome (SBS). Indoor air quality (IAQ) is discussed in detail including the factors that impact it such as inorganic contaminants including asbestos, radon and lead and the health hazards they present and testing methods for their presence. Combustion-generated contaminates such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides, tobacco smoke, and carbon dioxide (CO2) are analyzed, as are organic contaminants—aldehydes, VOCs/SVOCs, pesticides, formaldehyde (HCHO)—and the potential health hazards they present. Biological pollutants and the hazards they present are also discussed. Likewise, the impact of rodents, insect, and animal allergens on public health are explained and the steps that can be taken to reduce pollutant exposure. The attributes of thermal and visual comfort, noise pollution, and daylighting (including daylight factor) and their importance are examined. Lastly, the importance of ventilation, filtration, and the impact of pollution emitted by building materials on the indoor air quality are discussed as well as best practices to improve indoor air quality. Leading relevant organizations and codes are cited. Keywords: Building-related illness (BRI); sick building syndrome (SBS); inorganic contaminants; asbestos; radon (Rn); lead; Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC); carbon monoxide (CO); tobacco smoke; carbon dioxide (CO2); organic contaminants; volatile organic compounds (VOCs); pesticides; formaldehyde (HCHO); mold; viruses; allergens; rodents; insects; thermal comfort; noise; daylight factor; filtration; ventilation",1
"Encephalitis is inflammation and swelling of the brain, often caused by an acute viral infection, or a para- or postinfectious phenomenon known as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). The most common sporadic viral cause is herpes simplex virus, but arthropodborne viruses, such as Japanese encephalitis virus, are a major cause in some settings, and rabies in others. Herpes simplex encephalitis is treated with acyclovir; rabies and Japanese encephalitis are preventable with vaccines. With the reduction in measles through vaccination, the incidence of ADEM, which often follows measles, has also reduced.",1
"In this chapter we provide an overview of the immune system and its vital role maintaining human health. Immune responses require the coordinated action of leukocytes that travel the body to eliminate threats posed by trauma, infection, toxins, and cancer. Leukocytes communicate via direct contact and via production and receipt of soluble proteins and intercellular messenger proteins called cytokines. Complete clearance of unwanted entities may involve both innate and adaptive leukocyte responses, which influence each other. Some innate mechanisms require no induction and are completely non-specific, whereas others are inducible and involve broad receptor-mediated recognition of a limited number of pathogen-associated or damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs/DAMPs). Adaptive responses involve the selective activation of lymphocytes via engagement of their antigen receptors by a specific foreign antigen. The three major subsets of lymphocytes are T helper cells (Th), cytotoxic T cells (Tc) and B cells, which use distinct mechanisms to recognize antigen and carry out different effector functions. Immune system malfunction can contribute to many clinical illnesses including autoimmune disorders, allergies, immunodeficiencies, chronic inflammation and cancer.",1
"This chapter describes immune responses to the six major types of pathogens: extracellular bacteria, intracellular bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungi and prions. Innate immunity mediated by neutrophils, NK cells, NKT cells, γδ T cells, complement and microbicidal molecules prevents infection or slows it until adaptive immunity can also respond to the pathogen. Extracellular entities are coated in antibody and cleared by antibody- and complement-mediated mechanisms. Parasitic worms are prevented from anchoring in the host by IgA and IgE antibodies. IgE triggers mast cell, basophil and eosinophil degranulation and the release of toxic mediators. Intracellular bacteria and parasites as well as viruses are eliminated by CTLs, NK cells, NKT cells and γδ T cells secreting cytotoxic cytokines and/or carrying out target cell cytolysis. Macrophage hyperactivation and granuloma formation may be triggered to confine persistent invaders. Th1 and Th17 responses support cell-mediated immunity against internal threats, whereas Th2 responses support humoral immunity against external threats. Each type of pathogen has evolved to evade immune responses by avoiding recognition or inactivating various leukocyte effector mechanisms.",1

"Coronaviruses infect many species of animals including humans, causing acute and chronic diseases. This review focuses primarily on the pathogenesis of murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory coronavirus (SARS-CoV). MHV is a collection of strains, which provide models systems for the study of viral tropism and pathogenesis in several organs systems, including the central nervous system, the liver, and the lung, and has been cited as providing one of the few animal models for the study of chronic demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. SARS-CoV emerged in the human population in China in 2002, causing a worldwide epidemic with severe morbidity and high mortality rates, particularly in older individuals. We review the pathogenesis of both viruses and the several reverse genetics systems that made much of these studies possible. We also review the functions of coronavirus proteins, structural, enzymatic, and accessory, with an emphasis on roles in pathogenesis. Structural proteins in addition to their roles in virion structure and morphogenesis also contribute significantly to viral spread in vivo and in antagonizing host cell responses. Nonstructural proteins include the small accessory proteins that are not at all conserved between MHV and SARS-CoV and the 16 conserved proteins encoded in the replicase locus, many of which have enzymatic activities in RNA metabolism or protein processing in addition to functions in antagonizing host response.",1

"Although lacking the control available to toxicity studies, epidemiology allows for much larger study sizes and is particularly useful for identifying causal factors for population-wide health concerns. Some epidemiological studies are given more credence than their toxicological counterparts because the data are seen as more accurate for ‘real-life’ situations. Also, data collected for completely different reasons can often be incorporated into an epidemiological study. The greatest difference between epidemiology and toxicology, aside from the observational/experimental basis, is the measure of exposure, which, although it would improve any study, is often difficult to incorporate into epidemiological studies because of the historical nature of exposures.",1
"Infectious diseases are diagnosed by detection of a bacterium, virus, fungus, protozoan, or helminth in a patient with a compatible clinical illness. The methods of detection include cultivation of bacteria and fungi on growth medium, isolation of viruses in cell culture, and identification of the agent biochemically, antigenically, or genetically. Infectious diseases can also be identified by detection of a specific immune response, usually antibodies, that develop during the course of illness. Visualization of an agent in infected tissue can provide a diagnosis based on specific morphological characteristics or identify the category of organism, for example, gram-positive or gram-negative bacterium or virus (e.g., eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in neurons in rabies virus infection). Methods that detect and allow visualization of antigens (immunohistochemistry) or nucleic acid sequences (in situ hybridization) provide more specific diagnoses. Detection of specific nucleic acid sequences amplified by polymerase chain reaction is a powerful molecular diagnostic tool. Since the elucidation of the etiology of the first infectious disease, anthrax, more than 135 years ago, Koch's postulates have been applied and modified as novel technologies and agents have emerged. During the last 45 years, more than 70 previously unknown agents of infections have been identified in emerging infectious diseases, a phenomenon that is likely to continue.",1
"Spontaneous pathologies of the pancreas are important causes of morbidity and mortality in some veterinary species and rare in others. As in human beings, the pancreas of most domestic and exotic animals is a composite organ with both endocrine and exocrine functions. The similarities between structure and function of porcine, canine, and human pancreata are such that the pig and dog serve as valuable models in basic and translational studies, most recently for efforts aimed at modeling pancreatitis and diabetes, developing functional and sustainable replacement of endocrine functions, and in imaging and manipulation studies. This article will provide a brief review of spontaneous veterinary diseases and their underlying mechanisms and the morphological features that reflect these alterations. Several species- or breed-specific conditions and the effects of selected systemic diseases on the pancreas are also discussed. The contributions to our knowledge of pancreatic physiology and pathology by small mammal (rodent) and engineered animal models and the in-depth mechanisms homologous to those in the human pancreas are covered in other sections of this article.",1
"The indication for a small intestinal biopsy is usually the work-up of malabsorption, a clinicopathologic picture caused by a number of infectious and noninfectious inflammatory conditions. The biopsy is generally taken through an endoscope, by either forceps or suction, from the duodenum or proximal jejunum. Depending upon the underlying condition, morphological abnormalities are seen in malabsorption range from normal mucosa with increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (gluten-sensitive enteropathy, viral gastroenteritis, food allergies, etc.), villous shortening with crypt hyperplasia (celiac disease (CD), treated CD, tropical sprue, and bacterial overgrowth), to completely flat mucosa (CD, refractory sprue, enteropathy-induced T-cell lymphoma, and autoimmune enteropathy). Infectious agents that affect gastrointestinal tract can be grouped as food-borne and water-borne bacteria, opportunistic infections (bacterial, fungal, and viral), viral infections (extremely rarely biopsied), and parasitic and helminthic infections. The majority of these infections are, however, self-limited. Although biopsy is more invasive, the use of this procedure allows detection of other causes, including Whipple's disease, other protozoan forms of diarrhea (e.g., cryptosporidiosis, isosporiasis, or cyclosporiasis), Crohn's disease, or lymphoma that may also present as diarrhea and malabsorption.",1
"Medical microbiology involves the identification of microorganisms for the diagnosis of infectious diseases and the assessment of likely response to specific therapeutic interventions. Major categories of organisms include bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites. Microbiological methods combined with clinical symptoms, additional laboratory tests, and imaging techniques are used in combination to distinguish a true disease-associated infection from colonization with normal flora or other conditions, such as malignancies, inflammatory disorders, or autoimmune disorders, all of which have unique therapies and prognoses for the patient. Laboratories combine the use of traditional microscopy and culture methods, with a rapidly evolving set of molecular and proteomic techniques. Given the increase in immunocompromised patients due to an increase in transplantations, the human immunodeficiency virus epidemic, and the use of immunosuppressive agents to treat autoimmune disorders, diagnosis of microbial infections continues to be essential for many patients.",1

"Like all rules, even the genetic code has exceptions: these are generically classified as “translational recoding.” Almost every conceivable mode of recoding has been documented, including signals that redefine translational reading frame and codon assignation. While first described in viruses, it is becoming clear that sequences that program elongating ribosomes to shift translational reading frame are widely used by organisms in all domains of life, thus expanding both the coding capacity of genomes and the modes through which gene expression can be regulated at the posttranscriptional level. Instances of programmed ribosomal frameshifting and stop codon reassignment are opening up new avenues for treatment of numerous inborn errors of metabolism. The implications of these findings on human health are only beginning to emerge.",1
"Since the birth of the first somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) animal in 1996, SCNT has been successfully applied to produce live animals in many species, but its successful application in animal production has been hampered by heavy fetal and postnatal losses and widespread public concern. So far, cattle remain the species with the largest number of cloned animals born. Success in animal cloning relies not only on the skill of the micromanipulator, but also on integrated knowledge and expertise in the pathophysiology and biotechnology of reproduction, cell and molecular biology, biochemistry, embryology, neonatology and obstetrics, image diagnostics, internal medicine, and surgical procedures, among other complementary disciplines and areas of knowledge. This chapter addresses the care of SCNT individuals and their recipients. The health and care in cattle will be described first, as most information is available in this species. Recommendations regarding pigs and other species will follow.",1
"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a major problem of health and disability, with a relevant economic impact on society (e.g., €177 billion in Europe). Despite important advances in pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment, The primary causes of AD remain elusive, accurate biomarkers are not well characterized, and available pharmacological treatments are not cost-effective. As a complex disorder, AD is polygenic and multifactorial: hundreds of defective genes distributed across the human genome may contribute to its pathogenesis (with the participation of diverse environmental factors, cerebrovascular dysfunction, and epigenetic phenomena) and lead to amyloid deposition, neurofibrillary tangle formation, and premature neuronal death. Future perspectives for the global management of AD predict that structural and functional genomics and proteomics may help in the search for reliable biomarkers, and that pharmacogenomics may be an option in optimizing drug development and therapeutics.",1
"Asthma is a common respiratory disease with a complex etiology involving a combination of genetic and environmental components. Current asthma management involves a step-up and step-down approach based on asthma control with a large degree of heterogeneity in responses to the main drug classes currently in use: β2-adrenergic receptor agonists, corticosteroids, and leukotriene modifiers. Importantly, asthma is heterogeneous with respect to clinical presentation and the inflammatory mechanisms that underlie it. This heterogeneity likely contributes to variable results in clinical trials, particularly when targeting specific inflammatory mediators. These factors have motivated a drive toward stratified medicine in asthma based on clinical/cellular outcomes or genetics (i.e., pharmacogenetics). Significant progress has been made in identifying genetic polymorphisms that influence the efficacy and potential for adverse effects of all main classes of asthma drugs. Importantly an emerging role for genetics in phase II development of newer therapies has been demonstrated (e.g., anti-IL4). Similarly, the stratification of patients based on clinical characteristics (e.g., blood and sputum eosinophil levels) has been critical in evaluating newer therapies (e.g., anti-IL5). As a proof of concept, anti-IgE is the latest therapy to be introduced into clinical practice, although only for severe, allergic patients (i.e., in a stratified manner). As new asthma genes are identified using genome-wide association, among other technologies, new targets (e.g., IL33/IL33 receptor (IL1RL1)) will emerge and pharmacogenetics in these development programs will be essential. In this chapter we review the current understanding of asthma pathobiology and its clinical presentation, as well as the use of stratified medicine, which holds great promise for maximizing clinical outcomes and minimizing adverse effects in existing and new therapies.",1
"Hantaviruses are emerging zoonotic pathogens that belong to the Bunyaviridae family. They have been classified as category A pathogens by CDC (centers for disease control and prevention). Hantaviruses pose a serious threat to human health because their infection causes two highly fatal diseases, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). These pathogens are transmitted to humans through aerosolized excreta of their infected rodent hosts. Hantaviruses have a tripartite-segmented negative-sense RNA genome. The three genomic RNA segments, S, M, and L, encode a nucleocapsid protein (N), a precursor glycoprotein that is processed into two envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) and the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), respectively. N protein is the major structural component of the virus, its main function is to protect and encapsidate the three genomic RNAs forming three viral ribonucleocapsids. Recent studies have proposed that N in conjunction with RdRp plays important roles in the transcription and replication of viral genome. In addition, N preferentially facilitates the translation of viral mRNA in cells. Glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, play major roles in viral attachment and entry to the host cells, virulence, and assembly and packaging of new virions in infected cells. RdRp functions as RNA replicase and transcriptase to replicate and transcribe the viral RNA and is also thought to have endonuclease activity. Currently, no antiviral therapy or vaccine is available for the treatment of hantavirus-associated diseases. Understanding the molecular details of hantavirus life cycle will help in the identification of targets for antiviral therapeutics and in the design of potential antiviral drug for the treatment of HFRS and HCPS. Due to the alarming fatality of hantavirus diseases, development of an effective vaccine against hantaviruses is a necessity.",1
"Chemokines are a family of structurally related proteins that are expressed by almost all types of nucleated cells and mediate leukocyte activation and/or chemotactic activities. The role of chemokines in rabies pathogenesis and protection has only recently been investigated. Expression of chemokines is induced by infection with laboratory-adapted, but not street, rabies viruses (RABVs), and it has been hypothesized that expression of chemokines is one of the mechanisms by which RABV is attenuated. To further define the role of chemokines in rabies pathogenesis and protection, chemokine genes such as MIP-1α, RANTES, IP-10, and macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) have been cloned into RABV genome. It has been found that recombinant RABVs expressing RANTES or IP-10 induce high and persistent expression of these chemokines, resulting in massive infiltration of inflammatory cells into the central nervous system (CNS) and development of diseases and death in the mouse model. However, recombinant RABVs expressing MIP-1α, MDC, as well as GM-CSF further attenuate RABV by inducing a transient expression of chemokines, infiltration of inflammatory cells, enhancement of blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Yet, these recombinant RABVs show increased adaptive immune responses by recruiting/activating dendritic cells, T and B cells in the periphery as well as in the CNS. Further, direct administration of these recombinant RABVs into the CNS can prevent mice from developing rabies days after infection with street RABV. All these studies together suggest that chemokines are both protective and pathogenic in RABV infections. Those with protective roles could be exploited for development of future RABV vaccines or therapeutic agents.",1
"Until recently, single-stranded negative sense RNA viruses (ssNSVs) were one of only a few important human viral pathogens, which could not be created from cDNA. The inability to manipulate their genomes hindered their detailed genetic analysis. A key paper from Conzelmann's laboratory in 1994 changed this with the publication of a method to recover rabies virus (RABV) from cDNA. This discovery not only dramatically changed the broader field of ssNSV biology but also opened a whole new avenue for studying RABV pathogenicity, developing novel RABV vaccines as well a new generation of RABV-based vaccine vectors, and creating research tools important in neuroscience such as neuronal tracing.",1

"Publisher Summary This chapter evaluates the arguments on the emergence of the China real estate bubble and the accompanying opportunity for short selling. The lack of reliable data and the short operating history of China as a semicapitalist country make firm conclusions difficult. However, overall the evidence points to further problems in the Chinese banking and real estate sectors. If this is true, then it is not too late to short Chinese banks and property stocks. Some investors predict that China's real estate bubble will soon burst as the property prices in China are relatively high with respect to GDP per capita and as the Chinese government took actions in April 2010 to regulate real estate prices. However, economic activities in China are controlled by central and municipal governments, sizable state-owned banks, and enterprises to a great extent. In 2010, the magnitude of bank lending has been reduced greatly following the change in monetary policy. This is expected to cool down the transaction volume of the real estate market. Even with the drop of property prices, the Chinese central government is taking measures to curb current real estate prices. A decline of 30% or more in real estate prices is widely accepted by the central government, but it is not certain that commercial banks can assume such big declines. Possibly a decline of over 50% in real estate prices is expected to induce a new wave of financial crisis in China. Therefore, a rapid drop in real estate prices is hazardous to the banking system and the government expects a slow decline. The Chinese government has recognized that a bubble currently exists and has opted to contain real estate prices to maintain a “harmonious society.”",1

"Immunity to targeted infectious diseases may be conferred or enhanced by vaccines, which are manufactured from recombinant forms as well as inactivated or attenuated organisms. These vaccines have to meet requirements for safety, quality and efficacy. In addition to antigenic components, various adjuvants may be included in vaccines to evoke an effective immune response. To ensure the safety of new vaccines, preclinical toxicology studies are conducted prior to the initiation of, and concurrently with, clinical studies. There are five different types of preclinical toxicology study in the evaluation of vaccine safety: single and/or repeat dose, reproductive and developmental, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and safety pharmacology. If any adverse effects are observed in the course of these studies, they should be fully evaluated and a final safety decision made accordingly. Successful preclinical toxicology studies depend on multiple factors including: using the appropriate study designs, using the right animal model, and evoking an effective immune response. Additional in vivo and in vitro assays that establish the identity, purity, safety, and potency of the vaccine play a significant role in assessing critical characteristics of vaccine safety.",1
"Infectious agents have intimately co-evolved with the host immune system, acquiring a portfolio of highly sophisticated mechanisms to modulate immunity. Among the common strategies developed by viruses, bacteria, protozoa, helminths, and fungi is the manipulation of the regulatory T cell network in order to favor pathogen survival and transmission. Treg activity also benefits the host in many circumstances by controlling immunopathogenic reactions to infection. Interestingly, some pathogens are able to directly induce the conversion of naive T cells into suppressive Foxp3-expressing Tregs, while others activate pre-existing natural Tregs, in both cases repressing pathogen-specific effector responses. However, Tregs can also act to promote immunity in certain settings, such as in initial stages of infection when effector cells must access the site of infection, and subsequently in ensuring generation of effector memory. Notably, there is little current information on whether infections selectively drive pathogen-specific Tregs, and if so whether these cells are also reactive to self-antigens. Further analysis of specificity, together with a clearer picture of the relative dynamics of Treg subsets over the course of disease, should lead to rational strategies for immune intervention to optimize immunity and eliminate infection.",1
"This chapter discusses important and interesting lessons our HCI team have learned from our involvement with the design, development, and evaluation of CBRNE-related projects over the last decade. First, the Medical and Casualty Command Post (MedPost) revealed the importance of providing future users with a plausible scenario allowing them to act out their roles. This provided sufficient information on which to base their part of the user interface. We then address two issues that came to the fore in two further projects. PROBE is a CBRNE management system providing support for police, hazardous materials (hazmat) technicians, and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) teams, and the commercial eXplosives Identification Tool (XIT) aims to transform disparate, often paper-based, information on commercial explosives and articles into a standardized electronic database. Finally, we summarize the “take-away” messages that we believe may be helpful to HCI practitioners facing similar uncertain, often unpredictable, conditions. Keywords: emergency response, crisis management, CBRNE events, first responders, criminal investigations, explosives materials",1

"The eye is susceptible to adverse toxic effects by direct application, inadvertent ocular contact, or systemic exposure to chemicals or their metabolites. Although the albino rat is a less than ideal model for ocular toxicity studies, it has gained popularity for specific applications and may be the first species in which the ocular toxicity of a systemically administered xenobiotic becomes evident. This chapter reviews the embryology, anatomy, and physiology of the eye and associated glands and describes common nonneoplastic and neoplastic lesions encountered in laboratory rats.",1
"Chapter 22 outlines the morphology of the nose, larynx, and trachea. The text includes descriptions of spontaneous and treatment-related lesions observed in the tissues in toxicity and carcinogenicity studies. The text begins with a description of the normal upper respiratory tract through the stages of embryonic development. Anatomy and histology are discussed before delving into the various degenerative, regenerative, and adaptive lesions found in toxicology studies. Included in the text is information on inflammatory and vascular lesions, and how trauma and injury, as well as exposure to irritants, can elicit inflammatory responses. Molecular pathology of the upper respiratory tract is investigated, as well as an examination of the molecular alterations within specific cell types, providing a better understanding of the mechanisms of tissue injury.",1
"The lung is constantly exposed to a large volume of inhaled air that may contain toxicant xenobiotics. With the possibility of exposure to a variety of respiratory toxicants from airborne pollutants in our environment during the course of daily activities, in occupational settings, the use of aerosol sprays for household products, and the development of inhalant bronchial therapies, pulmonary toxicology has become an important subspecialty of toxicology. The lung is susceptible to injury following hematogenous exposure to toxicants. Susceptibility to injury and the type of response following exposure to air- or blood-borne toxicants is largely dependent on the physiochemical characteristics and concentration of the toxicant, duration of exposure, site/tissue specific sensitivity, and the integrity of the defense mechanisms of the lung. In this chapter, nonneoplastic and neoplastic spontaneous lesions and those that develop in the lungs of rats following exposure to toxicants by various routes, but primarily by inhalation, are discussed in detail which provides insight into our understanding of how human lungs respond to toxic chemicals. In addition, the gross and microscopic anatomy of the rat lung is also discussed some detail. Although inhalation is the primary route of exposure in experimental studies, in the past, many studies used intratracheal instillation or direct injection of known carcinogens into the lung. These experiments often resulted in the development of squamous cell carcinomas even though they are very rare as a naturally occurring neoplasm. Instillation of chemicals or particles into the trachea or pleura or direct injection into the lung results in lesions or responses that may not be as relevant to understanding the mechanism of pulmonary carcinogenesis as inhalation of materials under more normal conditions. There remain, however, many areas where our understanding of the response of the lung to toxic chemicals is incomplete.",1

"Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represent a heterogenous group of lung disease in critically ill patients. Despite the increased understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of ARDS, the mortality remains unacceptably high, ranging from 34% to 64%. Hence, ARDS represents an unmet medical need with an urgency to develop effective pharmacotherapies. Several promising targets that have been identified as potential therapies for ARDS have been limited because of difficulty with delivery. In particular, delivery of peptides and proteins to the lung is an ongoing challenge. Nanobiotechnology and nanoscience are the basis of innovative techniques to deliver drugs targeted to the site of inflamed organs, such as the lungs. Nanoscale drug delivery systems have the ability to improve the pharmacokinetics and pharmakodynamics of agents allowing an increase in the biodistribution of therapeutic agents to target organs, resulting in improved efficacy with reduction in drug toxicity. These systems are exploited for therapeutic purpose to carry the drug in the body in a controlled manner from the site of administration to the therapeutic target. Hence, it is an attractive strategy to test potential targets for ALI/ARDS using nanotechnology. To this end, we have identified several potential targets and proposed the delivery of these agents using nanomicelles to improve the drug delivery.",1
"Viral channel-forming proteins comprise a class of viral proteins which, similar to their host companions, are made to alter electrochemical or substrate gradients across lipid membranes. These proteins are active during all stages of the cellular life cycle of viruses. An increasing number of proteins are identified as channel proteins, but the precise role in the viral life cycle is yet unknown for the majority of them. This review presents an overview about these proteins with an emphasis on those with available structural information. A concept is introduced which aligns the transmembrane domains of viral channel proteins with those of host channels and toxins to give insights into the mechanism of function of the viral proteins from potential sequence identities. A summary of to date investigations on drugs targeting these proteins is given and discussed in respect of their mode of action in vivo.",1

"Membrane-anchored serine proteases are a group of extracellular serine proteases tethered directly to plasma membranes, via a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage (GPI-anchored), a C-terminal transmembrane domain (Type I), or an N-terminal transmembrane domain (Type II). A variety of biochemical, cellular, and in vivo studies have established that these proteases are important pericellular contributors to processes vital for the maintenance of homeostasis, including food digestion, blood pressure regulation, hearing, epithelial permeability, sperm maturation, and iron homeostasis. These enzymes are hijacked by viruses to facilitate infection and propagation, and their misregulation is associated with a wide range of diseases, including cancer malignancy.",1
"The intermediate compartment (IC) is a pleiomorphic membrane system that mediates two-way trafficing in the early biosynthetic-secretory pathway of mammalian cells. The IC associates with the cytoskeleton, binds COPI (coat protein I) coats and generates vesicular, tubular and saccular transport carriers. It recieves newly made proteins and lipids from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and sorts them for transport to the Golgi apparatus or recycling back to the ER. Although the IC appears to be functionally complex and resides at the crossroads of multiple transport routes, it is still disputed whether it represents a transient or stable structure.",1
Many viruses replicate and assemble in subcellular microenvironments called virus factories or ‘viroplasm.’ Virus factories increase the efficiency of replication and at the same time protect viruses from antiviral defenses. We describe how viruses reorganize cellular membrane compartments and cytoskeleton to generate these ‘mini-organelles’ and how these rearrangements parallel cellular responses to stress such as protein aggregation and DNA damage.,1
"T cells are an essential element that regulates the balance in immunity, by killing infected cells, helping antibody formation and suppressing autoimmune responses. However, T cells are incapable of recognizing native antigens. Instead, they recognize processed peptides presented by MHC molecules. Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen presenting cells that inform the fight against invasive pathogens while enforcing tolerance to self and harmless environmental antigens. They capture pathogens and receive signals from pathogens that influence the outcome of immune responses. On the basis of these signals, DCs orchestrate antigen specific T cell differentiation. Alternatively they can silence self-reactive T cells by inducing deletion, anergy or regulation (Treg). This article will discuss the discovery, function and development of DCs and the mechanisms by which they link innate immunity to adaptive immunity.",1
"Imbalance or malfunction of the immune systems is associated with a range of chronic diseases including autoimmune diseases, allergies, cancers and others. Various innate and adaptive immune cells that are integrated in this complex networking system may represent promising targets for developing immunotherapeutics for treating specific immune diseases. A spectrum of phytochemicals have been isolated, characterized and modified for development and use as prevention or treatment of human diseases. Many cytotoxic drugs and antibiotics have been developed from phytocompounds, but the application of traditional or new medicinal plants for use as immunomodulators in treating immune diseases is still relatively limited. In this review, a selected group of medicinal herbs, their derived crude or fractionated phytoextracts and the specific phytochemicals/phytocompounds isolated from them, as well as categorized phytocompound groups with specific chemical structures are discussed in terms of their immunomodulatory bioactivities. We also assess their potential for future development as immunomodulatory or inflammation-regulatory therapeutics or agents. New experimental approaches for evaluating the immunomodulatory activities of candidate phytomedicines are also discussed.",1
"Acute phase proteins (APP) were first identified in the early 1900s as early reactants to infectious disease. They are now understood to be an integral part of the acute phase response (APR) which is the cornerstone of innate immunity. APP have been shown to be valuable biomarkers as increases can occur with inflammation, infection, neoplasia, stress, and trauma. All animals—from fish to mammals—have demonstrable APP, but the type of major APP differs by species. While the primary application of these proteins in a clinical setting is prognostication, studies in animals have demonstrated relevance to diagnosis and detection and monitoring for subclinical disease. APP have been well documented in laboratory, companion, and large animals. With the advent of standardized and automated assays, these biomarkers are available for use in all fields of veterinary medicine as well as basic and clinical research.",1
"Foodborne illness is a serious public health concern. There are over 200 known microbial, chemical, and physical agents that are known to cause foodborne illness. Efforts are made for improved detection, control and prevention of foodborne pathogen in food, and pathogen associated diseases in the host. Several commonly used approaches to control foodborne pathogens include antibiotics, natural antimicrobials, bacteriophages, bacteriocins, ionizing radiations, and heat. In addition, probiotics offer a potential intervention strategy for the prevention and control of foodborne infections. This review focuses on the use of probiotics and bioengineered probiotics to control foodborne pathogens, their antimicrobial actions, and their delivery strategies. Although probiotics have been demonstrated to be effective in antagonizing foodborne pathogens, challenges exist in the characterization and elucidation of underlying molecular mechanisms of action and in the development of potential delivery strategies that could maintain the viability and functionality of the probiotic in the target organ.",1
"Biological material including microorganisms and toxins can be found in air or the atmosphere, and the study of this area is termed “aeromicrobiology.” Airborne biological materials are known as bioaerosols. This chapter introduces the basics of aeromicrobiology including the nature of bioaerosols and fundamentals of the aeromicrobiological (AMB) pathway. The nature of the atmosphere as a microbial habitat, and the factors that influence microbial survival in the air are described. This is followed by a discussion of extramural aeromicrobiology related to aerosolization of indigenous soil pathogens; influenza pandemics; microbiology in the clouds; agriculture; waste disposal; and airborne toxins. Intramural microbiology within buildings is discussed with respect to public health within buildings, hospitals and laboratories. Finally, measures to control bioaerosols including biosafety in the laboratory are documented.",1
"This chapter describes a variety of pathogens found in the environment that are capable of infecting humans and causing disease. Different classes of pathogens are discussed including bacteria, parasites and viruses. For each pathogen, data are provided on the incidence of the organism in a particular environmental matrix such as water, food or municipal waste. In addition, we discuss: the disease caused by the particular microbe; the mode of transmission; the incubation time needed within the host prior to the onset of disease; and the duration of illness. Fate and transport of pathogens in the environment are also described. A variety of bacterial pathogens are discussed including waterborne and waterbased bacteria. Parasites discussed include protozoa, nematodes, cestodes and trematodes. For viruses, both enteric and respiratory viruses are included.",1
"While the benefits of antibody responses are widely known, pathogens are also able to exploit antibodies to facilitate cell entry and potentially alter the cellular response via interactions with Fc receptors. This phenomenon, known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of disease, is a factor in numerous human and veterinary diseases. It is thought to result from innate cellular responses to Fcγ receptor-facilitated entry of infectious microbial immune complexes, and paradoxically results in increased production of pathogenic organisms. ADE has been described in vitro in numerous settings, but the strongest data regarding the in vivo impact of this mechanism on human disease come from human disease and animal models of dengue and leishmanial infections. This chapter reviews the literature of ADE in relation to the innate immune responses to Fcγ receptor ligation by infectious IgG immune complexes and discusses the research frontiers regarding this harmful antibody activity.",1

"Because in the past vaccines were considered inherently safe, only limited nonclinical testing used to be required. However, from about 2003 more stringent nonclinical testing guidelines were introduced for novel vaccines (and, in some cases, marketed vaccines attempting registration in new markets) given that vaccines are typically administered to healthy individuals, often infants. These safety considerations become even more important as technologies allowing the development of novel vaccine types are developed, such as DNA vaccines and those delivered in vector systems such as adenoviral vectors. The use of adjuvants other than the standard aluminum-based ones and novel delivery systems such as electrostimulation have also led to additional testing requirements. This chapter describes the current regulatory expectations for the preclinical development of vaccines.",1
"Publisher Summary The analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is described as the central nervous system equivalent of the complete blood count and the analogy is a good one. A CSF analysis provides a general index of neurologic health, and it often provides evidence of the presence of disease. Similar to a complete blood count, CSF analysis has reasonable sensitivity but low specificity. The possible alterations of CSF are relatively limited compared to the varieties of neurologic diseases that exist. Additionally, the type and degree of CSF abnormality seems to be related as much to the location of disease as to the cause or the severity of the lesion; meningeal and paraventricular diseases generally produce greater abnormalities than deep parenchymal diseases. Previous therapy may affect the type, degree, and duration of CSF abnormalities as well. The CSF abnormalities identified upon analysis are also dependent on the CSF collection site with respect to lesion location. CSF analysis only occasionally provides a specific diagnosis.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the functions of gastrointestinal tract. The principal functions of the gastrointestinal tract are assimilation of nutrients and excretion of the waste products of digestion. Within the gastrointestinal tract, these substances are solubilized and degraded enzymatically to simple molecules, sufficiently small in size and in a form that permits absorption across the mucosal epithelium. The distribution of the different types of secretory cells in the salivary glands varies among species. The mandibular and sublingual glands are mixed salivary glands containing both mucous and serous types of cells, and produce a viscous secretion that contains large amounts of mucus. The cytoplasm of the secretory cells contains numerous zymogen granules that vary in size and number depending on the activity of the gland. These granules contain the precursors of the hydrolytic enzymes responsible for digestion of the major dietary components. The cells of the terminal ducts probably secrete the bicarbonate ion responsible for neutralizing hydrochloric acid that enters the duodenum from the stomach.",1
"The way people have thought about disasters has changed in almost immeasurable ways. They are no longer considered as “Acts of God” but caused either by natural hazards or by human actions. This shift in thinking has led to different ways of dealing with disasters. What is becoming apparent is that more and more disasters are being produced by human actions. We cause them but seem unable to find the political will to stop doing so. Further, the role of humanitarian agencies has changed. At one time bodies such as the Red Cross would be associated with helping the injured in the battlefield. The nature of present-day warfare or complex emergencies and terrorism means that humanitarian bodies are dealing with many vulnerable refugees and internally displaced people. The following polemic reflects on these changes.",1
"As obligate parasites of cellular processes, viruses must take over cellular macromolecular machinery. It is also becoming clear that viruses routinely control intracellular signaling pathways through the direct or indirect control of kinases and phosphatases. This control of cellular phosphoproteins is important to promote a variety of viral processes, from control of entry to nuclear function to the stimulation of viral protein synthesis. This review focuses on the takeover of the cellular phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway by a variety of retroviruses, DNA viruses, and RNA viruses, highlighting the functions ascribed to virus activation of PI3K and Akt activity. This review also describes the role that the PI3K/Akt pathway plays in the host response, noting that it that can trigger anti- as well as proviral functions.",1
This chapter addresses the application of data and information fusion to the design of integrated systems in the Homeland Protection (HP) domain. HP is a wide and complex domain: systems in this domain are large (in terms of size and scope) integrated (each subsystem cannot be considered as an isolated system) and different in purpose. Such systems require a multidisciplinary approach for their design and analysis and they are necessarily required to provide data and information fusion in the most general sense. The first data fusion algorithms employed in real systems in the radar field go back to the early seventies; now a days new concepts have been developed and spread to be applied to very complex systems with the aim to achieve the highest level of intelligence as possible and hopefully to support decision. Data fusion is aimed to enhance situation awareness and decision making through the combination of information/data obtained by networks of homogeneous and/or heterogeneous sensors. The aim of this chapter is to give an overview of the several approaches that can be followed to design and analyze systems for homeland protection. Different fusion architectures can be drawn on the basis of the employed algorithms: they are analyzed under several aspects in this chapter. Real study cases applied to real world problems of homeland protection are provided in the chapter.,1
"Lectins are proteins of non-immune origin that bind specific carbohydrates without chemical modification. Coupled with the emerging biological and pathological significance of carbohydrates, lectins have become extensively used as research tools in glycobiology. However, lectin-based drug development has been impeded by high manufacturing costs, low chemical stability, and the potential risk of initiating an unfavorable immune response. As alternatives to lectins, non-protein small molecules having carbohydrate-binding properties (lectin mimics) are currently attracting a great deal of attention because of their ease of preparation and chemical modification. Lectin mimics of synthetic origin are divided roughly into two groups, boronic acid-dependent and boronic acid-independent lectin mimics. This article outlines their representative architectures and carbohydrate-binding properties, and discusses their therapeutic potential by reviewing recent attempts to develop antiviral and antimicrobial agents using their architectures. We also focus on the naturally occurring lectin mimics, pradimicins and benanomicins. They are the only class of non-protein natural products having a C-type lectin-like ability to recognize d-mannopyranosides in the presence of Ca2+ ions. Their molecular basis of carbohydrate recognition and therapeutic potential are also discussed.",1
"This chapter provides an overview of the global epidemiology of rabies, focusing on major changes over the past half-century and highlighting recent discoveries. This chapter also describes the natural and iatrogenic routes of transmission, as well as the risk and necessary actions for the prevention of rabies following an exposure. It reviews the methods for rabies diagnosis and the biologics for prevention, in addition to differences in rabies prophylaxis recommendations among advisory committees. The chapter also considers epidemiology and trends in global human rabies and the dynamics of the corresponding mammalian reservoir hosts for each area. Furthermore, it considers the phylogenetics of rabies virus, other lyssaviruses, and specific rabies virus variants in the context of regional rabies and the potential for novel emergences. Special attention is paid to developed countries, where existing surveillance and diagnostic infrastructure have provided detailed insights into the nature changing patterns in rabies epidemiology-patterns expected to be increasingly relevant to other less-developed nations based on current trends. Special attention is afforded to canine rabies, as dogs remain responsible for over 99% of all human exposures to the virus, including the methods and problems associated with intentional and unintentional movement of dogs at national and international levels. Finally, the chapter discusses the economic burden of rabies in terms of human and infrastructure support.",1
"Subclinical immunosuppression in chickens is an important but often underestimated factor in the subsequent development of clinical disease. Immunosuppression can be caused by pathogens such as chicken infectious anemia virus, infectious bursal disease virus, reovirus, and some retroviruses (e.g., reticuloendotheliosis virus). Mycotoxins and stress, often caused by poor management practices, can also cause immunosuppression. The effects on the innate and acquired immune responses and the mechanisms by which mycotoxins, stress and infectious agents cause immunosuppression are discussed. Immunoevasion is a common ploy by which viruses neutralize or evade immune responses. DNA viruses such as herpesvirus and poxvirus have multiple genes, some of them host-derived, which interfere with effective innate or acquired immune responses. RNA viruses may escape acquired humoral and cellular immune responses by mutations in protective antigenic epitopes (e.g., avian influenza viruses), while accessory non-structural proteins or multi-functional structural proteins interfere with the interferon system (e.g., Newcastle disease virus).",1

Viruses are the main causal agents of diarrhea, and much evidence exists about the effectiveness of probiotics in its prevention and shortening. Although the scientific evidence supports the medical use of probiotics as antiviral therapy, a careful evaluation of the efficacy of different strains, their optimal doses, and treatment extension needs to be done. Furthermore, their mechanisms of action have yet to be disclosed in most cases. Keywords: Diarrhea; Gastroenteritis; Lactic acid bacteria; Norovirus; Probiotics; Rotavirus",1
The ability of microorganisms to cause infection is governed by multiple different factors – some linked to the microorganisms itself and others to the host or environment. In this chapter we explore some of these factors and provide an overview of disseminated infections examining some important manifestations such as toxic shock syndrome and sepsis as well as examining some of molecular aspects including host receptors and bacterial antigens. A brief discussion will also follow about disseminated infections in specific populations such as neonates and the immunosuppressed.,1
"Respiratory tract infections are among the most common and important problems in clinical medicine. The approach to these infections begins with a basic understanding of the pathophysiology of the respiratory tract and how immune defences interact with pathogens. A number of distinct clinical syndromes can be defined which help physicians and clinical microbiologists develop a differential diagnosis of potential infecting pathogens. The type and severity of infection is often modulated by the medical characteristics of the patient, circumstances surrounding infection, geography and environmental exposures. Multiple laboratory test methodologies are available to aid clinical diagnosis and close communication between clinicians and laboratory personnel can optimise the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of diagnosis. Molecular testing for respiratory viruses has become widely used in the clinical setting and will expand to include other pathogens of the respiratory tract.",1

"There is a close functional relationship between the male reproductive and immune systems. Immunological responses against sperm antigens or other elements of the reproductive tract can lead to androgen insufficiency, infertility, or chronic inflammation. Systemic or local immune activation and inflammation directly inhibit the hypothalamic-pituitary-Leydig cell axis, interfere with spermatogenic cell development, and may provoke sperm antibody formation. Traditional explanations for protection of spermatogenic cells, based on physical barriers or immune cell exclusion, are not consistent with either the organization of the reproductive tract or modern concepts of immunoregulation. Regulation of immune responses in the male reproductive tract involves immunoregulatory macrophages and lymphocytes, as well as active somatic cell suppression of antigen-specific immunity by anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive factors, including cytokines and androgenic steroids. These restraints on antigen-specific immune mechanisms appear to be counterbalanced by enhanced innate immunity. Finally, inflammatory signaling pathways appear to play an important role in normal male reproductive function, and there is evidence that establishment of male reproduction during development is intimately linked to the maturation of the local immune environment.",1
"Many infections are associated with damage inflicted either directly or indirectly by invading pathogens. Although some infections do not result in host damage, it is often a natural consequence of the activities of virulence factors produced by the pathogens in order to facilitate survival, and proliferation in the host or onward transmission to another host. The damage often manifests itself as the symptoms of disease which can be useful for diagnosis and for informing appropriate treatments. A wide array of different types of toxins which cause damage to the host are produced by different bacterial pathogens. Here we provide examples of well-characterised toxins and describe their mechanisms of action, and potential function with regard to pathogenesis. In addition we describe indirect damage to the host in the form of inflammation or immunopathology, typically the result of the host's own immune response. Finally, we discuss diarrhoea as a special case and list some of the major pathogens and the toxins associated with this devastating disease.",1

"China’s political and administrative systems are mysteries to many Westerners. At one level, China is a one-party state that has been ruled by the Chinese Communist Party since 1949. In the late 1950s, the same authoritarian regime was waging a massive campaign under the name of the ‘Great Leap Forward’, which resulted in the loss of a large number of lives. From 1966 to 1976, the same regime was launching a so-called ‘Great Cultural Revolution’, causing serious cultural and economic damages to this nation. Furthermore, influential theories of the political economy of the former socialist systems emphasize that unless the one-party monopoly is abolished, reforms are doomed to fail. Obviously, the achievements of China’s modernization defy conventional explanations. Consequently, this will lead to the asking of questions such as: How has the Chinese political system worked during the past decades? Can it be sustained in the long run?

"The term ‘Greater China’ is defined in this chapter as one which includes Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and mainland China. There have been different names for the greater China area, such as ‘the Chinese circle’, ‘the Chinese community’, ‘the greater China community’, ‘China economic circle’, ‘Chinese economic area’, ‘China economic zone’, and so on. Probably first used by George Cressey at least as far back as the 1930s, the term ‘Greater China’ was to refer to the entire Chinese empire, as opposed to China proper (Harding, 1993, p. 660). The term ‘Greater China’ is now generally used for referring to the cultural and economic ties between the relevant territories, and is not intended to imply sovereignty. Sometimes, to avoid any political connotation, the term Chinese-speaking world is often used instead of the Greater China. Despite the common historical, cultural, and linguistic homogeneity, the greater China economic area has followed different routes of economic developments. Hong Kong and Macau have been under the colonial administrations of the UK and of Portugal, respectively. Taiwan was a Japanese colony between 1895 and 1945 and, following a short period of reunification with mainland China, has been operating independently from the rest of the world. As a result, significant social and economic differences have been present in the four parts of the area, especially since 1949. The Taiwan Strait became a forbidden boundary in 1949 when the Nationalist-led government fled to Taiwan and, at the same time, the Communist-led government was founded on the mainland. Since then, Taiwan and mainland China have been two divergent regimes. Against the common cultural and linguistic homogeneity, mainland China chose essentially to pursue a socialist line, while Taiwan followed the route of market-oriented capitalism. Furthermore, the two sides have also treated each other antagonistically, particularly during the high tide of military confrontation, when the mainland claimed that it would liberate the Taiwan compatriots from the black society sooner or later, while in turn Taiwan maintained that they would use the ‘three democratisms’ to reoccupy the mainland eventually. The Chinese people have a long history of migrating overseas. One of the migrations dates back to the Ming dynasty when Zheng He (1371–1435) became the envoy of the Ming emperor. He sent people – many of them Cantonese and Hokkien – to explore and trade in the South China Sea and in the Indian Ocean. Different waves of immigration led to subgroups among overseas Chinese such as the new and old immigrants in Southeast Asia, North America, Oceania, the Caribbean, Latin America, South Africa, and Russia. From the mid-nineteenth century onward, emigration has been directed primarily to Western countries (such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, and Western Europe). Many of these emigrants were themselves overseas Chinese or were from Taiwan or Hong Kong, particularly from the 1950s to the 1970s, a period during which the PRC placed severe restrictions on the movement of its citizens. In 1984, Britain agreed to transfer the sovereignty of Hong Kong to the PRC; this triggered another wave of migration to the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, USA, Latin America, and the other parts of the world. The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 further accelerated the migration. The wave calmed after Hong Kong’s transfer of sovereignty in 1997. In addition, many citizens of Hong Kong hold citizenships or have current visas in other countries so if the need arises, they can leave Hong Kong at short notice.

"The past decade has seen the emergence of innate immunity as a mature field. The study of innate immunity has had a significant impact on the concepts of HIV immunity, pathogenesis, and vaccines. In this chapter, basic concepts of innate immunity at the anatomical, cellular, and molecular levels will be introduced from the perspective of their interplay with HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). An emphasis will be placed on studies using SIV/non-human primate (NHP) models that shape current models of HIV pathogenesis. Finally, studies modulating the innate system in vivo in NHPs will be discussed.",1

"The purpose of this introductory chapter is to provide the reader with a brief overview of the factors that drive disease emergence in order to set the scene for the more detailed chapters that follow. The chapter is divided into three parts. The first deals with the activities of humans that drive disease emergence. This ranges from historical factors such as animal domestication to the impact of new technologies such as air travel and agricultural intensification in response to population growth. The second section deals with virus properties that enable them to adapt to new hosts, particularly jumping between species. The final section deals with the activities of animals themselves that contribute to disease emergence.",1
"The preceding chapters have described in detail specific examples of viruses that have emerged or re-emerged from animal sources. Most, although not all, are zoonotic and have caused significant human morbidity and mortality. This final chapter will attempt to bring together a number of the common themes raised by these examples. These include the role of historical events in shaping the emergence of viruses in the present, the ability to retrospectively test samples to trace the emergence of disease and the technologies used to detect viruses. Technologies such as the polymerase chain reaction and mass sequencing have revolutionized virus detection and enabled the rapid identification and characterization of viruses. The application of these methods has led to the identification of new groups of viruses in samples obtained from a range of animal species without the need for invasive sampling or the recovery of live virus. However, with the detection of such a large range of viruses that exist asymptomatically with other species, the challenge now becomes the identification of those with the potential to become pathogenic for humans.",1

"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped viruses responsible for severe respiratory diseases in birds and mammals. In infected cells they induce double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes (CMs), which are thought to be the site of virus replication. Until recently, both the origin of the CoV-induced vesicles and the exact localization of CoV replication remained unknown. It was assumed that the vesicles derive from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Nevertheless no conventional protein markers of the ER, ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), Golgi, or coatomer proteins could be detected in these structures. Recent data from our laboratory and others shed light on this mystery. It appears that the Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV), a prototype CoV, co-opts ERAD tuning vesicles as replication platforms. These vesicles are released from the ER, but do not contain conventional ER markers or coatomer proteins. Rather, they contain ERAD factors such as SEL1L, EDEM1, and OS-9 that are constitutively cleared from the folding compartment by so called ERAD tuning programs, and display non-lipidated LC3 (LC3-I) periferically associated at their limiting membrane. In MHV-infected cells, the ERAD tuning vesicle markers co-localize with viral non-structural proteins and double-stranded RNA, which are DMV markers. The unconventional role of LC3-I in the MHV infection cycle is further supported by the fact that Atg5 and Atg7, both essential proteins for LC3-I to LC3-II conversion and macroautophagy, are dispensable for CoV replication and DMV formation. These new insights into CoV replication might lead to new therapies to treat CoV infections. They also reveal a novel role for LC3, in its non-lipidated form, in both maintenance of cellular proteostasis and viral infection, the latter function supported by recent findings showing involvement of LC3-I in equine arteritis virus replication.",1

"Society and industry—still the only provider of approved medicine—share the desire to treat important diseases. Governments too, since some diseases’ high prevalence affect the economic output of society. Yet the decisions as to which drugs will be developed are strictly in private hands. The risks required to treat some really important, and often increasingly prevalent, diseases mean that the desires of society and the industry are diverging. This is not boding well for our society. The understanding and willingness of governments to step in as a partner and financier is not apparent. Will governments recognize their role in this? Since the economic cost of these diseases, in terms of reduced productivity and medical costs to treat the disease, is enormous, understanding should be forthcoming. Government has invested for many decades in an enormous program of cancer research, which now shows dividends. The importance of further government investment in basic research is apparent when industry does not want to or cannot anymore afford it. As Big Pharma drops out of important therapeutic areas, it is not promising to assume that government can step in to the vacancy. There has to be a serious effort to find a formula by which the government gently or not so gently forces the industry to continue its efforts because it is so important. Perhaps the most important of these neglected diseases is Alzheimer’s disease (AD) because of its dehumanizing nature and its predictably massively increasing prevalence. Yet, none of the currently approved Alzheimer drugs can be used to prevent, cure, or even significantly slow the progression of this disease. It is predicted that by 2030 50% of the over 80s will have the disease. Almost 100% of people with an inheritable trait will develop the disease unless we succeed in finding a preventive therapy. Only recently has a preventive trial been announced. It is often thought that insulin-dependent diabetes is a well-treated disease and needs no further diagnostic and drug development efforts. This could not be further from the truth. The long-term complications of insulin-treated diabetes add to the economic burden, especially as the growth in prevalence of the disease expands with the waistlines of the world’s population. Three hundred million may have type 2 diabetes by 2030. Pharmaceutical control of weight loss has so far been vexed by serious side effects. When it comes to diabetes drugs, we start to recognize that the control of blood glucose can be further improved; the biggest contribution is not by drugs, but by self-diagnosis with point of care glucose measuring devices. Morphine is still the most effective medicine against pain. It has been around for 5,000 years and we haven’t come up with anything better. But it can be ineffective against neuropathic pain and cancer pain. New pain medicines are difficult to find because of the subjective measurement and poor animal models. Since many current pain killers are abused, there are other hurdles. Despite the many difficulties, society needs new pain killers at the same time that notable pharma are pulling out, despite the economic opportunity. Drugs against cancer have had many high-profile and expensive failures in recent years, with all major companies having at least one failed candidate. Biotech companies have made much progress, however, and they are either collaborating with or being taken over by Big Pharma. Oncology drug development has been crucially enabled by decades of government investment. The key is the many characterized drug targets that other disease areas do not have. Government intervention in oncology and HIV provide the model for treatment of AD, neuropathic pain, and schizophrenia, among other therapeutic areas. Increasing governmental direct funding of translational research is not the solution many hope it will be.",1

"The genus Dianthovirus is one of eight genera in the family Tombusviridae. All the genera have monopartite positive-stranded RNA genomes, except the dianthoviruses which have bipartite genomes. The dianthoviruses are distributed worldwide. Although they share common structural features with the other Tombusviridae viruses in their virions and the terminal structure of the genomic RNAs, the bipartite nature of the dianthovirus genome offers an ideal experimental system with which to study basic issues of virology. The two genomic RNAs seem to use distinct strategies to regulate their translation, transcription, genome replication, genome packaging, and cell-to-cell movement during infection. This review summarizes the current state of our knowledge of the dianthoviruses, with its main emphasis on the molecular biology of the virus, including the viral and host factors required for its infection of host plants. The epidemiology of the virus and the possible viral impacts on agriculture and the environment are also discussed.",1
"Parasitic nematodes of livestock have major economic impact worldwide. Despite the diseases caused by these nematodes, some advances towards the development of new therapeutic agents and attempts to develop effective vaccines against some of them, there has been limited progress in the development of practical diagnostic methods. The specific and sensitive diagnosis of parasitic nematode infections of livestock underpins effective disease control, which is now particularly important given the problems associated with anthelmintic resistance in parasite populations. Traditional diagnostic methods have major limitations, in terms of sensitivity and specificity. This chapter provides an account of the significance of parasitic nematodes (order Strongylida), reviews conventional diagnostic techniques that are presently used routinely and describes advances in polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods for the specific diagnosis of nematode infections. A particular emphasis is placed on the recent development of a robotic PCR-based platform for high-throughput diagnosis, and its significance and implications for epidemiological investigations and for use in control programmes.",1
"Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is an alternative source of hematopoietic stem cells for transplantation in patients with hematological malignancies, bone marrow failures, immunodeficiencies, and inherited metabolic disorders. In order to facilitate these transplants, large repositories of frozen UCB units collected from altruistic unrelated donations have been established and to date there are more than 600,000 units stored in cord blood banks all over the world. These products have been collected, stored, and released for transplantation under stringent quality conditions in order to ensure their safety and efficacy. The development and evolution of the policies and procedures currently in use in cord blood banking have been largely influenced by the clinical outcome of the transplants performed using these units. This review will describe some of the main steps and procedures involved in the clinical banking of unrelated UCB donations starting from the recruitment and selection of the potential donor (the mother) to the final distribution of the unit to the transplant program and its clinical outcome follow-up.",1
"Health planning and policy seek to create a group of mutually interacting bodies to produce goods and services to meet the health needs of a population. Recent developments in the health status of the population are characterized by continuous improvement in life expectancy, chronic diseases which absorb 90% of total health care expenditure, differences in the causes of mortality (more than 70% mortality from cancer, heart and brain, and external causes). The new trends in health indicators define the current health policies and lead to the necessity of adapting the health system so as to meet the changing health needs of the population. Especially in the context of the changes in the epidemiological spectrum and the variability in the indices of morbidity and mortality, the focus is not only to further prolong life expectancy but also to improve life expectancy without chronic diseases and without disabilities and to reduce the avoidable mortality, the potential years of life lost before the age of 65years. According to this approach, the main strategic priorities of health policy in the European Union for the period 2014–2020 are: (1) Prevention and health promotion (to combat diseases associated with the modern way of life), (2) Protection from cross-border threats (to address the external impact from cross-border relations, combating epidemics, pandemics), (3) Viability (to address the lack of resources by adopting innovation), (4) Accessibility (to assure the access to medical expertise).Therefore, the key priorities are the prevention of disease and the improvement of life in good health, the patient safety and quality of health services, and the readiness to manage crises and health risks.",1

"Cupressus sempervirens L. (Cupressaceae), known as Mediterranean cypress, is a medicinal and aromatic plant with decorative uses. It is widely distributed throughout the Mediterranean region, including Syria, Turkey, Cyprus, Lebanon, Palestine, and some Greek Islands, as well as the southern coasts of the Caspian Sea in Iran. The plant has a long history of utilization in folk medicine in many countries, mainly for cough and flu treatment, and the research has consistently shown that C. sempervirens has antimicrobial, antiviral, insecticidal, antihyperlipidemic, cytotoxic, antioxidant, antiplatelet, hepatoprotective, and neurobiological activities to varying extents. The mentioned biological activities of the plant are strongly associated with its phytochemical content, which is particularly rich in phenolic constituents and essential oils that could be responsible for most of its antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antiviral activities. This chapter covers botanical information, brief phytochemistry, and pharmacological activities related to C. sempervirens.",1

"Infections may be hazardous to the health of the mother, the course of pregnancy, and the unborn child. They can lead to premature labor or premature rupture of membranes and thereby increase the risk for spontaneous abortion and prematurity. Furthermore, certain germs can pass to the unborn child and harm it directly. Therefore, an anti-infective treatment which should be both effective and safe for the mother and the unborn child is often required. The use of penicillines and older cephalosporines is well documented and considered to be safe. Consequently, they are the drug of choice during pregnancy. In selected cases of bacterial resistance or intolerance to first-line antibiotics, other anti-infective agents might be recommended. Especially for life-threatening infections, a therapy with not so well-tried agents might be needed. The potential benefit of treatment in such cases most often outbalances the potential risk for the unborn child.",1

"Flaviviruses are the most prevalent arthropod-borne viruses worldwide, and nearly half of the 70 Flavivirus members identified are human pathogens. Despite the huge clinical impact of flaviviruses, there is no specific human antiviral therapy available to treat infection with any of the flaviviruses. Therefore, there is a continued search for novel therapies, and this review describes the current knowledge on the usage of RNA interference (RNAi) in combating flavivirus infections. RNAi is a process of sequence-specific gene silencing triggered by double-stranded RNA. Antiviral RNAi strategies against arthropod-borne flaviviruses have been reported and although several hurdles must be overcome to employ this technology in clinical applications, they potentially represent a new therapeutic tool.",1
"Today’s laboratory mouse, Mus musculus, has its origins as the ‘house mouse’ of North America and Europe. Beginning with mice bred by mouse fanciers, laboratory stocks (outbred) derived from M. musculus musculus from eastern Europe and M. m. domesticus from western Europe were developed into inbred strains. Since the mid-1980s, additional strains have been developed from Asian mice (M. m. castaneus from Thailand and M. m. molossinus from Japan) and from M. spretus which originated from the western Mediterranean region.",1
"The laboratory rat, Rattus norvegicus, is within the order Rodentia and family Muridae. The genus Rattus contains at least 56 species (retrieved January 28, 2014, from the Integrated Taxonomic Information System online database http://www.itis.gov); however, the Norway rat, R. norvegicus, and the black rat, R. rattus, are the two species most commonly associated with the genus. Rattus rattus preceded R. norvegicus in migration from Asia to Europe and the Americas by several hundred years. The former species reached Europe in the 12th century, and the Americas in the 16th century; whereas, R. norvegicus emerged in the 18th century in Europe and in the 19th century in the Western Hemisphere. Globally, the Norway rat has largely displaced the black rat, probably because of the Norway rat’s larger size and aggressiveness. The domestication and introduction of the albino R. norvegicus is rooted by its use in Europe and America in the 1800s as prey for a sport (rat baiting) in which individuals would wager on which terrier dog would most swiftly kill the largest number of rats confined to a pit. Because of the large numbers of rats needed for this sport, wild rats were purpose-bred, and albinos were selected out by some people as a hobby (Robinson, 1965; Mayhew, 1851).",1
"The hamster species used as research models include the Syrian (golden), Mesocricetus auratus; the Chinese (striped-back), Cricetulus griseus; the Armenian (gray), C. migratorius; the European, Cricetus cricetus; and the Djungarian, Phodopus campbelli (Russian dwarf) and P. sungorus (Siberian dwarf). Hamsters are classified as members of the order Rodentia, suborder Myomorpha, superfamily Muroidea and in family Cricetidae. Animals in this family are characterized by large cheek pouches, thick bodies, short tails, and an excess of loose skin. They have incisors that erupt continuously and cuspidate molars that do not continue to grow ((I 1/1, C 0/0, PM 0/0, M 3/3) × 2 = 16). In 2010, it was reported that approximately 146,000 hamsters were used in research in the United States (United States Department of Agriculture, 2010).",1
"The guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), the only New World rodent used commonly in research, has contributed to studies of anaphylaxis, asthma, gnotobiotics, immunology, infectious and nutritional disease, and otology, among others. Several outbred and inbred strains were used historically, but at present, only outbred pigmented stocks, albino Hartley stocks, and IAF hairless stock are available commercially in the United States (Fig. 6.1). Husbandry considerations include noninjurious housing, appropriate food, prevention of intraspecies aggression, environmental stability, and reproductive aspects, including a long gestation. Although guinea pigs are susceptible to a wide range of diseases, current breeding and housing conditions have reduced the occurrence of many spontaneous infectious diseases in these animals. Diseases of concern that do occur in research colonies include respiratory diseases (especially those caused by Bordetella, Streptococcus, and adenovirus), chlamydiosis, pediculosis, dermatophytosis, hypovitaminosis C, pregnancy toxemia, urolithiasis, traumatic lesions, dental malocclusion, ovarian cysts, and antibiotic-induced intestinal dysbiosis.",1
"Beginning in 1931, an inbred rabbit colony was developed at the Phipps Institute for the Study, Treatment and Prevention of Tuberculosis at the University of Pennsylvania. This colony was used to study natural resistance to infection with tuberculosis (Robertson et al., 1966). Other inbred colonies or well-defined breeding colonies were also developed at the University of Illinois College of Medicine Center for Genetics, the Laboratories of the International Health Division of The Rockefeller Foundation, the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands, and Jackson Laboratories. These colonies were moved or closed in the years to follow. Since 1973, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has reported the total number of certain species of animals used by registered research facilities (1997). In 1973, 447,570 rabbits were used in research. There has been an overall decrease in numbers of rabbits used. This decreasing trend started in the mid-1990s. In 2010, 210,172 rabbits were used in research. Despite the overall drop in the number used in research, the rabbit is still a valuable model and tool for many disciplines.",1
"Mice (Mus musculus), rats (Rattus norvegicus), other rodent species, and domestic rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) have been used in research for over 100 years. During the first half of the 20th century, microbiological quality control of lab animals was at best rudimentary as colonies were conventionally housed and little or no diagnostic testing was done. Hence, animal studies were often curtailed and confounded by infectious disease (Mobraaten and Sharp, 1999; Morse, 2007; Weisbroth, 1999). By the 1950s, it became apparent to veterinarians in the nascent field of comparative medicine that disease-free animals suitable for research could not be produced by standard veterinary disease control measures (e.g., improved sanitation and nutrition, antimicrobial treatments) in conventional facilities. Henry Foster, the veterinarian who founded Charles River Breeding Laboratories in 1948 and a pioneer in the large-scale production of laboratory rodents, stated in a seminar presented at the 30th anniversary of AALAS, “After a variety of frustrating health-related problems, it was decided that a major change in the company’s philosophy was required and an entirely different approach was essential”. Consequently, he and others developed innovative biosecurity systems to eliminate and exclude pathogens (Allen, 1999). In 1958, Foster reported on the Cesarean-originated barrier-sustained (COBS) process for the large-scale production of specific pathogen-free (SPF) laboratory rodents (Foster, 1958). To eliminate horizontally transmitted pathogens, a hysterectomy was performed on a near-term dam from a contaminated or conventionally housed colony. The gravid uterus was pulled through a disinfectant solution into a sterile flexible film isolator where the pups were removed from the uterus and suckled on axenic (i.e., germ-free) foster dams. After being mated to expand their number and associated with a cocktail of nonpathogenic bacteria to normalize their physiology and prime their immune system, rederived rodents were transferred to so-called barrier rooms for large-scale production. The room-level barrier to adventitious infection entailed disinfection of the room, equipment, and supplies, limiting access to trained and properly gowned personnel, and the application of new technologies such as high-efficiency particulate air-filtration of incoming air (Dubos and Schaedler, 1960; Foster, 1980; Schaedler and Orcutt, 1983; Trexler and Orcutt, 1999). The axenic and associated rodents mentioned in the COBS process are collectively classified as gnotobiotic to indicate that they have a completely known microflora. By contrast, barrier-reared rodent colonies are not gnotobiotic because they are housed in uncovered cages and thus acquire a complex microflora from the environment, supplies, personnel, and other sources. Instead, they are described as SPF to indicate that according to laboratory testing, they are free from infection with a defined list of infectious agents, commonly known as an ‘exclusion’ list.",1
"Historically, the dog played an important role as a laboratory animal in biomedical research. Although numbers are declining, the use of dogs continues to be common in pharmacokinetics and cardiovascular studies. The normal biology of the dog as both a laboratory and a companion animal has been well studied and reference values are presented here as a clinical and experimental resource. This provides the necessary background to discuss the spontaneous diseases, including infectious and neoplastic conditions, prevalent in purpose bred as well as random source dogs used in biomedical research. In addition, diseases and conditions that arise secondary to the housing and experimental manipulation of dogs is discussed with emphasis on treatment and prevention.",1
"Domestic cats (Felis cattus) comprise a small (2%) percentage of the non-rodent animals used in biomedical research. In 2011, 21,700 cats of a total 1,134,693 non-rodent animals were used in research (APHIS, 2011). According to the National Research Council Committee on Scientific and Humane Issues in the Use of Random Source Dogs and Cats in Research (National Research Council, 2009), peak use of cats occurred in 1974. Since that time, the number of cats used in research has fallen by 71%, with more than 98% of those cats being purpose bred for research. Cats are a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) covered species with special housing requirements defined in the Animal Welfare Act and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NRC, 2011). At the request of congress, a committee of experts formed by the National Research Council examined the use of random source dogs and cats and concluded that obtaining dogs and cats from Class B dealers is not necessary for NIH funded research (National Research Council, 2009). While the number of cats used in biomedical research has declined, cats continue to contribute uniquely to biomedical science and are valuable research model for several disciplines, including aspects of neurology involved in locomotion and spinal trauma, retrovirus and zoonotic disease research, and for developing therapeutic strategies for inherited diseases.",1
"Ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) belong to the ancient family Mustelidae, which is believed to date back to the Eocene period, some 40 million years ago. The taxonomic groups in the family Mustelidae, as recognized by Nowak (1999), include 67 species in 25 genera from North, Central, and South America; Eurasia; and Africa. No other carnivore shows such diversity of adaptation, being found in a wide variety of ecosystems ranging from arctic tundra to tropical rainforests. Mustelids have retained many primitive characteristics, which include relatively small size, short stocky legs, five toes per foot, elongated braincase, and short rostrum (Anderson, 1989). The Mustelinae is the central subfamily of the Mustelidae. The best-known members of the Mustelinae are the weasels, mink, ferrets (genus Mustela), and the martens (genus Martes) (Anderson, 1989). The genus Mustela is divided into five subgenera: Mustela (weasels), Lutreola (European mink), Vison (American mink), Putorius (ferrets), and Grammogale (South American weasels). The smallest member of the Mustelidae family is the least weasel (Mustela nivalis), which weighs as little as 25g, and the largest member is the sea otter (Enhydra lutris), which can weigh as much as 45kg (Nowak, 1999).",1
"Ruminants continue to be important in their traditional role in agricultural research and teaching. They are now also extensively used for studies in molecular biology; genetic engineering; and biotechnology for basic science, agricultural and clinical applications. Concern and interest for the welfare for these species and improved understanding of their biology and behavior have continued and are reflected in changing husbandry and management systems. This chapter addresses at high levels basic biology, husbandry, and the more common or important diseases of the three ruminant species used most commonly in the laboratory, namely sheep, goats and cattle.",1

"Human risks of acquiring a zoonotic disease from animals used in biomedical research have declined over the last decade because higher quality research animals have defined microbiologic profiles. Even with diminished risks, the potential for exposure to infectious agents still exists, especially from larger species such as nonhuman primates, which may be obtained from the wild, and from livestock, dogs, ferrets, and cats, which are generally not raised in barrier facilities and are not subject to the intensive health monitoring performed routinely on laboratory rodents and rabbits. Additionally, when laboratory animals are used as models for infectious disease studies, exposure to microbial pathogens presents a threat to human health. Also, with the recognition of emerging diseases, some of which are zoonotic, constant vigilance and surveillance of laboratory animals for zoonotic diseases are still required.",1
"Immunological and technical advances have led to tremendous increases in the number of people potentially able to benefit from allotransplantation. Ironically, it is the success of the field that has led to a renewed interest in xenotransplantation during the past several decades. To a large part, this has occurred because of the great scarcity of human organ and tissue donors. However, it has expanded to include the use of cells from animals into humans such as porcine islet cells for diabetes or extracorporeal perfusion of human blood through animal organs or cells. Similar to allotransplantation, issues regarding transmission of infections from the graft to the human recipient were brought up for consideration with these procedures in the 1990s (Michaels and Simmons, 1994; Chapman et al., 1995; Hammel et al., 1998; Fishman et al., 1998). A risk for infection exists with the use of any biologic agent regardless of whether it is from a human or an animal source. Accordingly, transmission of infections from human organs, tissues, or cells is a well-recognized cause of disease after allotransplantation (Ison and Grossi, 2013; Green and Michaels, 2012). As the human graft shortage continues, newer cellular therapies are explored. Thus, attention continues to be given to the potential use of xenogeneic organs, tissues, or cells for human maladies through xenotransplantation. The potential for novel zoonotic infections to emerge because of xenotransplantation (xenozoonoses or xenosis) led to a debate on whether the field should be permitted to progress. This chapter reviews the issues of xenotransplantation related to infections from animals to humans. Lessons learned from infections with prior nonhuman primate xenotransplantation and human allotransplantation are used to help inform about risks with newer xenogeneic procedures. In addition, information on known zoonoses is reviewed to better develop constructs to decrease the hazard of infection with these novel procedures.",1

"Protein-templated dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC) has emerged as a powerful method to identify new inhibitors given that it enables the protein to select its own best binder(s) from a library of interconverting compounds. Since the first report of DCC applied to the discovery of binders for a protein, this elegant tool has been employed on a range of protein targets in early stage of medicinal-chemistry projects. A toolbox with various reversible and biocompatible reactions has become available, and the portfolio of analytical techniques is growing. Despite progress, in most cases, the libraries employed remain of moderate size due to difficulties associated with their analysis. In this article, analytical methods used in protein-templated DCC are described using examples of recent developments and reports.",1

"Ubiquitination is emerging as an important post-translational modification (PTM) for numerous cellular functions including protein degradation, DNA damage repair and tolerance, and cell cycle progression. Compared with other small-molecule modifiers found in phosphorylation, acetylation and glycosylation, ubiquitin is a small protein modifier that exists as either a single ubiquitin or a polyubiquitin chain. Furthermore, the polyubiquitin chains are formed via various linkages imparting an additional layer of specificity in cellular signaling. In order to adequately study ubiquitin signaling and particularly deubiquitination, a number of ubiquitin activity-based probes (ABPs) were developed and utilized in understanding the deubiquitinase (DUBs) function. Here, we focus on the current state of the DUB ABP development and their application in understanding DUB function and specificity for polyubiquitin chains and ubiquitinated proteins.",1
"Wastewater treatment is the means by which water that has been used and/or contaminated by humans or nature is restored to a desirable quality. Treatment may consist of chemical, biological, or physical processes or a combination thereof. Water may be treated to any level of quality desired; however, as its purity increases, so does the cost of attaining that purity. The required quality of water is dictated by its intended use, for example, aquatic life, drinking water, or irrigation. The purpose of this chapter is to describe wastewater treatment technologies predominantly in use today. Ultimately, the technology selected as appropriate for one application may not be the optimal for another. Selection will be based on site-specific factors, such as resources available, climate, land availability, economics, etc.",1
"Published almost 50years ago, the Limits to Growth remains relevant to contemporary environmental health, though, paradoxically, this relevance is scarcely recognized. The seminal ideas it presented provide a useful background, as do the later Planetary Boundaries analyses, with which to consider key issues in contemporary environmental health. To be more than reactive, it is necessary to understand the complexity and interactions of integrated environmental health risks, including the possibility of significant global population decline within the current century. This contribution provides an overview to the Limits to Growth, linking it especially to the “planetary boundaries” of climate change, biodiversity loss and novel entities (including artificial substances and genetically modified organisms). The gradual increase in the amount of primary energy required to generate useable energy is also argued to be an under-recognized contributing factor to the decline in real wages growth for much of the world’s population since then, although this aspect may be improving. These elements have positive and negative health effects, which we discuss.",1
"Environment has complex and permanent relations with the biological warfare in comparison to other war types (conventional, nuclear, chemical). Changes of the environment interfere with many of the major determinants of biological warfare. The most probable type and the key issue of biological war is bioterrorism. Bioterrorism is defined as a release of biological agents or toxins that affect human beings, animals, or plants with the intent to harm or intimidate. The essence of bioterrorism is a biological attack. Four components are required for a biological attack: perpetrators, agents, mediums/means of delivery, and targets.",1
"Invasive species are currently a far-reaching, interdisciplinary topic given their broad impacts on biodiversity, economics, and human health, with representatives from all taxonomic levels (e.g., viruses, bacteria, algae, plants, invertebrates, large mammals). Researchers from different fields are working to build a framework for understanding how to best evaluate, quantify, and predict different kinds of impacts by non-indigenous species (NIS). In this context, there has been some controversy regarding the appropriate way to define invasive species and the invasion process, given the widespread use of these terms in both scientific and nonscientific frameworks. Although scientists have not unambiguously identified tax-independent characteristics that define all invasive species, the invasion process itself has been observed to progress through the same sequence of stages regardless of taxonomic identity (i.e., initial establishment, expansion, and saturation). Several non-exclusive hypotheses have been proposed to explain the successful establishment and spread of non-indigenous species in new environments. In the scenario of global change, species introductions and invasions are a major topic due to ecological impacts (e.g., changes in biodiversity), economic and social impacts (e.g., costs incurred for control or eradication or pests) and human health impacts (e.g., epidemics or increased exposure to hazards). Current research highlights the introduction and spread of non-indigenous species as both a consequence and cause of global change with repercussions on ecosystems, economies, and human societies.",1
"Although it has been used for centuries, bismuth remains one of the least understood elements in the periodic table. Metallic bismuth and bismuth compounds have been widely used in the manufacture of alloys, pigments, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. As a “green” heavy metal, the substitution of lead with bismuth in some industries may partially resolve the environmental problems related to heavy metal pollution. In health care, as bismuth has low toxicity to humans, bismuth-based drugs such as colloidal bismuth subcitrate (CBS), ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC), bismuth subsalicylate (BSS), bismuth iodoform and radioactive bismuth (212Bi/213Bi) complexes have been developed and used in clinics to treat various diseases. In most cases, bismuth therapies exhibit high therapeutic efficacies and little side effects; nevertheless, there are still reported cases of bismuth toxicity caused by bismuth over-dosage.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on plant growth curves. The world-population growth curve is an exponential curve. What do plant growth curves look like? Because water is the most important soil physical factor affecting plant growth, it is important to quantify plant growth to determine effects of water stress. In any experimental dealing with plant–water relations, some measure of plant growth (e.g., height, biomass) should be obtained. Plant growth curves also exemplify quantitative relationships. The chapter seeks to understand basic principles of plant–water relations. If equations can be developed to show relationships, then one can predict what is going to happen. Equations describing plant-growth curves demonstrate how one can quantify, and thus predict, plant growth. The chapter first considers the growth of the bacterium Escherichia coli. In the early nineteenth century, when plants and animals were being classified, the bacteria were arbitrarily included in the plant kingdom, and botanists first studied them. Even though bacteria are not plants or animals, we can follow their growth to understand plant growth curves.",1
This chapter commences with a discussion for ensuring a start-up enterprise survives by knowing some of the common mistakes that lead to failure. This is followed by a discussion of how to establish a routine. An important discussion on cash flow management ensues. Managing expectations of clients and shareholders is next discussed and concludes with pointers on how to stay the course.,1
"Pulmonary infections by viruses may result in serious diseases of public health importance. The problems of the infections are exacerbated by rapid transmission of the pathogenic agents, which occur through inhalation and direct contact with contaminated surfaces. Moreover, cross-species transmission resulting from changes to viral genetic makeup poses a risk for emergence of pathogens with new characteristics, which in some cases may be responsible for causing different diseases. With the advent of efficient sequencing and nucleic acid-based virus-disabling technologies, gene therapy is well placed to advance new treatments to counter respiratory infections. Most studies aimed at using nucleic acids to treat respiratory viral infections have used RNA interference (RNAi) to silence viral gene targets. A few studies have used silencing of host factors required by the viruses as a means of inhibiting viral replication and preventing emergence of escape mutants. By administering antivirals to the airways, studies performed in vivo have taken advantage of the anatomy of the respiratory system to deliver therapeutic nucleic acids. Reported data have shown proof of principle of efficacy of gene therapy in models of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, influenza virus A, and measles virus, among others. RNAi-based gene therapy has been advanced to clinical trial for treatment of RSV infection. Although the primary endpoint was not met in an intent-to-treat analysis, the investigation has provided useful information for the advancement of gene therapy for current and emergent respiratory infections.",1
"Antiviral gene therapy conveniently relies on use of rationally designed nucleic acids to disable replication of the pathogens. Popular targets for this therapy have been sequences encoding viral proteins and cellular host factors on which viruses depend for their replication. Therefore, availability of technologies that inactivate genes specifically, safely and effectively is crucial. Hence, discovery of RNA interference and advances in gene editing methods have been particularly important to the field. Gene transfer to induce prophylactic and therapeutic immunostimulation is also being developed to manage viral infections. Although promising, progress and ultimate success of antiviral gene therapy is dependent on several factors. These include overcoming problems that are generic to the field and influences of elements that are particular to specific viral infections. Viral and nonviral vectors (NVVs) have been used to deliver antiviral sequences, and both have advantages and drawbacks. Viral vectors are suited to delivering DNA-based expression cassettes, including immunostimulatory and virus-targeting sequences, whereas NVVs may be better applied to carrying therapeutic RNAs such as synthetic short interfering RNAs or mRNAs. Nonviral formulations are appealing because they cause limited immunostimulation, obviate mutagenic effects of DNA, and are amenable to easier dose control and large-scale synthesis. To date, encouraging results have been obtained in preclinical and clinical assessments of gene therapy against HIV-1, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and Ebola viruses, among others. In the long term, widespread application of antiviral gene therapy will be dependent on the technology demonstrating good efficacy and advantages over other antiviral strategies. Access to appropriate material and human resources that are required for implementation of the technologies in various settings will also be important.",1

"Viruses are major pathogenic agents causing a variety of serious diseases in humans, other animals, and plants. Drugs that combat viral infections are called antiviral drugs. There are no effective antiviral drugs for many viral infections. However, there are several drugs for influenza, a couple of drugs for herpesviruses, and some new antiviral drugs for treatment of HIV and hepatitis C infections. The arsenal of antivirals is complex. As of March 2014, it consists of approximately 50 drugs approved by the FDA, approximately half of which are directed against HIV. Antiviral drug creation strategies are focused on two different approaches: targeting the viruses themselves or targeting host cell factors. Direct virus-targeting antiviral drugs include attachment inhibitors, entry inhibitors, uncoating inhibitors, protease inhibitors, polymerase inhibitors, nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, and integrase inhibitors. Protease inhibitors (darunavir, atazanavir, and ritonavir), viral DNA polymerase inhibitors (acyclovir, valacyclovir, valganciclovir, and tenofovir), and an integrase inhibitor (raltegravir) are included in the list of Top 200 Drugs by sales for the 2010s.",1

The chapter examines such issues as air transportation security and safety, issues of fire at airport terminals, and issues of health and international travel, both from the perspective of the traveler and from the perspective of the host community. The chapter also examines some of the issues dealing with both train travel and motor coach travel and develops a template for how tourism security professionals need to deal with these issues.",1

"The Eye chapter of the 3rd edition of Haschek and Rousseaux’s Handbook of Toxicologic Pathology brings a comprehensive description of pathological processes affecting the ocular tissues in the most commonly used laboratory animals and their correlations with human diseases of interest in toxicology. Also presented are detailed descriptions of the structure and function of the different ocular tissues, the most advanced techniques applied in the toxicological evaluation of the eye, useful animal models of human disease, and known mechanisms of ocular toxicity. The introductory sections of the chapter also feature such essential topics as ocular embryology, an overview of clinical ophthalmic evaluation, and eye-specific techniques of tissue processing.",1
"Concepts of preventing infection, malnutrition, and sanitation have existed since ancient times. Ideals of “sanctity of human life” and “improve the world” in Mosaic Law, linked with Greek traditions of healthful nutrition and lifestyle, are relevant in modern public health. Roman sanitary engineering and military medicine made pivotal contributions. Hospital organization and university training for physicians developed during Islamic and Christian periods. The rise of cities, the Renaissance, and rapid changes in agriculture, trade, and industry all contributed to public health. New social, political, and economic reforms in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, contributing to sanitation, social reform, and improved nutrition and medical care, led to improved longevity and quality of life in the twentieth century. Immunology, social security, health insurance, and health promotion expanded the scope and effectiveness of global health. Biomedical and social sciences, technology, and public health organization are critical as public health faces old and new health challenges.",1
"Ancient societies recognized the needs of sanitation, food safety, workers’ health, and medical care to protect against disease and to promote well-being and civic prosperity. New energies and knowledge since the eighteenth century produced landmark discoveries such as prevention of scurvy and vaccination against smallpox. The biological germ theory and competing miasma theory each proved effective in sanitation, and immunization in control of infectious diseases. Non-communicable diseases as the leading causes of mortality have responded to innovative preventive care of health risk factors, smoking, hypertension, obesity, physical inactivity, unhealthful diets, and diabetes mellitus. Health promotion proved effective to modern public health in tackling disease origins, individual behavior, and social and economic conditions. The global burden of infectious and non-communicable diseases, aging and chronic illness faces rising costs and still inadequate prevention. The evolution of concepts of public health will have to address these new challenges of population health.",1
"Public health depends on information derived from monitoring population health status to identify community health problems, and to diagnose and investigate health problems and hazards in the community. These depend on vital statistics and disease reporting systems, including for non-communicable diseases, injuries, risk factors, health care resources, utilization of resources, and special disease registries such as for cancer, birth defects, and many others. Information technology and computerization allow data systems to be linked to assess the impact of health conditions and utilization of services providing vital information for epidemiological and economic analyses for policy development. Epidemiology and its associated quantitative disciplines of biostatistics and demography are augmented by social and behavioral qualitative research methods. The disciplines of health systems research provide evidence from population health monitoring crucial to policy and priority determination. This introductory chapter is augmented in subsequent chapters, and by specialized courses in public health education programs.",1
"Sanitation, food control, vaccines, and antibiotics have reduced the toll of communicable diseases, saving millions of lives. Smallpox was eradicated in 1977, and poliomyelitis eradication is close. Measles mortality has reduced drastically yet outbreaks occur where immunization lags. HIV/AIDS emerged in the 1980s, grew into a global pandemic costing millions of lives, and despite progress remains a major global health issue. Malaria and tuberculosis still cause millions of deaths. Influenza pandemics with new, deadly versions continue to appear. Neglected tropical diseases are responding to global donor efforts. Newly emerging diseases move to new regions and became endemic, and deadly localized hemorrhagic fevers threaten to transmit more widely. Rapid mass travel allows infectious diseases in isolated villages to quickly become global threats. New strains of viruses, antibiotic resistance, and microorganisms causing chronic diseases are challenges for infectious disease control requiring continuing political, financial, and scientific support, and much tenacity.",1
"Environmental and occupational health is affected by chemical, physical, radiological, and biological agents in the air, water, and soil. Health risks include injury, and exposure to toxic radiation, carcinogenic and teratogenic agents, leading to cancer, lung and heart diseases. Environmental factors may result in instant death or long-term illness from unsafe environmental or working conditions. The environment affects populations from small workplace settings to large-scale communities, as well as having global effects. International and governmental responsibility, through policies, laws, regulations, standards, policies, and planning, is vital for tackling global aspects of pollution, including climate change, cataclysmic natural events, drought, air and water pollution, and the potentially catastrophic effects of weather changes. Preparation for disasters is a core public health function in managing the after-effects of tsunamis, hurricanes, floods, and drought. These are potent political and public health issues with huge economic and societal effects.",1
"Public health consists of a complex of activities of public and private organizations working to protect and promote the health of the population, within laws, regulations, legal precedents, and ethics to ensure individual rights as well as those of society. Elected governments in unitary or federal states have legislative, executive, and judicial functions with taxing and enforcement powers. Unitary countries have two levels of government: national and local; federal states have three: federal, state, and local. Each level has official public health responsibilities. Interaction with governmental, non-governmental, and professional organizations, and the public is vital to successful public health. Higher levels of government have greater tax resources, so cost sharing from state and national levels is essential. Low-income countries generally allocate low levels of funding to health and have weak public health infrastructures. Linkages among prevention, health promotion, and medical care are essential to meet population and individual health targets.",1
"Health systems are complex organizations. They are often the largest single employer in a country, with expenditures of public and private money of 4–17 percent of gross domestic product. Overall and individual facility management requires mission statements, objectives, targets, budgets, activities planning, human interaction, services delivery, and quality assurance. Health organization involves a vast complex of stakeholders and participants, suppliers and purchasers, regulators and direct providers, and individual patients, and their decision-making. These include pyramidal and network organizations and ethical decision-making based on public interest, resource allocations, priority selection, and assurance of certain codes of law and ethical conduct. This chapter discusses how complex organizations work, with potential for application in health, and the motivations of workers and of the population being served. Organization theory helps in devising methods to integrate relevant factors to become more effective in defining and achieving goals and missions.",1
"Health care systems ideally include universal access to comprehensive prepaid medical care along with health promotion and disease prevention. National health insurance and national health services of various models have evolved in the developed world and increasingly in developing countries as well. Some models, such as the Bismarckian social security model and the Bereidge National Health Service model, or National Health insurance such as in pioneered in Canada, are used by a number of countries. The common features are based on principles of national responsibility and solidarity for health, social solidarity for providing funding and searching for effective ways of providing care. Various universal systems of health coverage exist in all industrialized countries, except in the United States which has a mix of public and private insurance but with high percentages of uninsured and poorly insured. Health reform is a continuing process as all countries aspire to assure health care for all. Aging populations, increasing costs, advancing and increasing technology all require nations to modify and adapt organization and financing systems of health care, health protection and promotion.",1
"A health system is an expensive knowledge-based industry made up of professionals, paraprofessionals, and administrative and support personnel. Human resources to provide and manage public health and clinical services are crucial to developing and sustaining national and global health systems. High-income countries are replete with highly trained and motivated personnel, but face issues such as increasing costs of care for aging populations and using new categories of health workers. Low-income countries face severe human resource shortages as training programs are underdeveloped. Health workforce issues include urban–rural differentiation, promoting standards and quality of care, specialization versus primary care, tensions between public and private health systems, and integrating new health professions. Migration of health professionals from low-income to high-income countries hampers the buildup of a critical mass of leaders, providers, and teachers to expand the capacity of health systems. Strategic policies are crucial to this field.",1
"Technology assessment capability is vital in determining health policy and priorities because science and technology changes occur rapidly and are essential for progress. Quality is promoted by high professional education and practice standards, accreditation by state and non governmental authorities for health provider institutions, public health departments as well as educational program for public health, health policy and health management. Quality is an ongoing challenge in health care and public health. New innovations and therapies change the nature of care and prevention, with important epidemic and epidemiologic effects. Adoption of new evidence based methods of prevention, diagnosis and therapy have and will continue to improve quality of life and longevity. Translation of scientific and technological advances into applied practice requires education of public health policy makers, and practitioners to be well trained to evaluate new evidence and keep up with rapidly changing capacity to address old and new challenges in public health. The context of public health is set in legal frameworks and ethical standards developed over many millennia, centuries and decades which need continuous revision in keeping with societal changes and norms. Law and ethics in public health reflect the societal values in the context of social, economic, demographic, epidemiologic and political changes, while facing new health challenges and new technologies. Health ethics needed to be reexamined in the light of medical participation in 20th century genocides in the name of racial purity and industrialized murder of millions in World War II. The Nuremberg Trials redefined ethics of health research and bioethics. Public health works to protect the population from illness and premature death, often with restrictions such as in cigarette advertisement and smoking. Failure to act in protection of public health can be unethical by denying best practices in health protection and health promotion.",1

"The respiratory tract is served by a variety of lymphoid tissues, including the tonsils, adenoids, nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT), and bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT), as well as the lymph nodes that drain the upper and lower respiratory tract. Each of these tissues uses unique mechanisms to acquire antigens and respond to pathogens in the local environment and supports immune responses that are tailored to protect those locations. This chapter will review the important features of NALT and BALT and define how these tissues contribute to immunity in the upper and lower respiratory tract, respectively.",1
"Although innate immunity came into the research spotlight in the late 1990s when its instructive role in the adaptive immune response was recognized, innate humoral defense factors have a much older history. The exocrine secretions of the body contain a plethora of distinct soluble factors (lysozyme, lactoferrin, peroxidases, proline-rich proteins, histatins, etc.) that protect the body from mucosal microbial pathogens. More recent studies have established that the humoral arm of innate immunity contains a heterogeneous group of pattern-recognition molecules (e.g., pentraxins, collectins, and ficolins), which perform diverse host-defense functions, such as agglutination and neutralization, opsonization, control of inflammation, and complement activation and regulation. These pattern-recognition molecules, which act as functional predecessors of antibodies (“ante-antibodies”), and the classic soluble innate defense factors form an integrated system with complementary specificity, action, and tissue distribution, and they are the subject of this chapter.",1
"The airway epithelial cell barrier serves as the main site of replication for most of the common respiratory viruses and is thereby the first line of defense against these viruses. Host epithelial cells are specially enriched for pattern recognition receptors that activate immune response genes to limit viral replication. A prominently expressed set of these genes encodes cytokines that orchestrate key aspects of host defense, such as recruitment of immune cells and repair of epithelial cell damage. Under some circumstances, airway epithelial cells may be programmed to release cytokines (notably IL-33) that activate a type 2 immune response, which in excess might contribute to the development of chronic obstructive lung disease. Moreover, long-term epithelial progenitor cells with this capability may explain an ongoing susceptibility to lung disease in response to acute respiratory infection or other types of inhaled danger signals. The mucosal airway epithelial cell can thereby mediate a beneficial response for host defense and a detrimental response leading to inflammatory disease.",1
"This chapter reviews the main viral pathogens of the respiratory tract, the immune responses they induce, currently available vaccines, and vaccines that are in development to control them. The main viruses responsible for acute respiratory infection in people include respiratory syncytial, influenza, human parainfluenza, human metapneumo-, human rhino-, corona-, and adenoviruses. Licensed vaccines are available only for influenza virus, with vaccines against the other pathogens either in clinical trials or in preclinical stages of development. The majority of studies evaluating respiratory virus vaccines measure serum antibody responses, because, although both cellular and humoral responses contribute to the clearance of a primary infection, neutralizing antibodies are known to protect against secondary infection. Humoral responses can be readily detected after vaccination with inactivated or subunit vaccines; however, fewer individuals seroconvert after vaccination with live vaccines. Alternative immune mechanisms such as mucosal antibody responses are probably responsible for protection by live attenuated vaccines, and immune correlates of protection are under investigation.",1
"This chapter reviews papers mostly written since 2005 that report results using live attenuated bacterial vectors to deliver after administration through mucosal surfaces, protective antigens, and DNA vaccines, encoding protective antigens to induce immune responses and/or protective immunity to pathogens that colonize on or invade through mucosal surfaces. Papers that report use of such vaccine vector systems for parenteral vaccination or to deal with nonmucosal pathogens or do not address induction of mucosal antibody and/or cellular immune responses are not reviewed.",1
"The use of plants for production of recombinant proteins has evolved over the past 25years. The first plant-based vaccines were expressed in stably transgenic plants, with the idea to conveniently deliver “edible vaccines” by ingestion of the antigen-containing plant material. These systems provided a proof of concept that oral delivery of vaccines in crude plant material could stimulate antigen-specific serum and mucosal antibodies. Transgenic grains like rice in particular provide a stable and robust vehicle for antigen delivery. However, some issues exist with stably transgenic plants, including relatively low expression levels and regulatory issues. Thus, many recent studies use transient expression with plant viral vectors to achieve rapid high expression in Nicotiana benthamiana, followed by purification of antigen and intranasal delivery for effective stimulation of mucosal immune responses.",1
"Infections of mucosal surfaces are major causes of morbidity, mortality, and economic loss in species of veterinary interest, and a concern for animal welfare. Vaccines are used extensively in veterinary medicine, and innovative vaccine technologies such as recombinant DNA-vectored and distinguishing infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) vaccines and automated in ovo vaccination (of embryonated chicken eggs) have been rapidly adopted commercially. Immunological research using outbred, nonrodent animal models has contributed to a broader understanding of mucosal defenses, and has provided the initial impetus for investigation of the common mucosal immune system. Studies of the potential of novel adjuvants to improve vaccine efficacy against genetically unstable, immune-subverting RNA viruses, such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in pigs, should assist in the control of pathogens with similar characteristics in other species. Successful development of vaccines to prevent and treat ascending infections of the reproductive tract of cattle set a precedent for applications in other species including humans. Studies of mucosal adjuvants and delivery systems continue at the interface between passive and active immunity, with the goal of inducing the earliest possible protection against enteric and respiratory pathogens of neonates.",1
"Whereas active immunity refers to the process of exposing the individual to an antigen to generate an adaptive immune response, passive immunity refers to the transfer of antibodies from one individual to another. Passive immunity provides immediate but short-lived protection, lasting several weeks up to 3 or 4 months. Passive immunity can occur naturally, when maternal antibodies are transferred to the fetus through the placenta or from breast milk to the gut of the infant. It can also be produced artificially, when antibody preparations derived from sera or secretions of immunized donors or, more recently, different antibody producing platforms are transferred via systemic or mucosal route to nonimmune individuals. Passive immunization has recently become an attractive approach because of the emergence of new and drug-resistant microorganisms, diseases that are unresponsive to drug therapy and individuals with an impaired immune system who are unable to respond to conventional vaccines. This chapter addresses the contributions of natural and artificial acquired passive immunity in understanding the concept of passive immunization. We will mainly focus on administration of antibodies for protection against various infectious agents entering through mucosal surfaces.",1
"Mucosal immune responses within the middle ear and eustachian tube generally provide an effective and efficient response to the presence of microbial pathogens, with approximately 80% of clinically recognizable middle ear infections resolved within 7days. Particularly for young children aged less than 3years of age, the proximity and direct connection of the middle ear, via the eustachian tube, to the nasopharynx provide increased risk of commensal bacteria and upper respiratory tract viruses infecting the middle ear. Mucosal immunological defense in the middle ear and eustachian tube utilizes a number of mechanisms, including physicochemical barriers of mucus and the mucosal epithelial cells and innate immune responses such as inflammation, cellular infiltration, effusion, and antimicrobial protein secretions, in addition to adaptive host immune responses. Recent advances in otopathogen recognition via microbial pattern recognition receptors and elucidation of complex signaling cascades have improved understanding of the coordination and regulation of the middle ear mucosal response. These advances support vaccine development aiming to reduce the risk of otitis media in children.",1
"The mammary gland (MG) lacks a mucosa but is part of the mucosal immune system because of its role in passive mucosal immunity. The MG is not an inductive site for mucosal immunity. Rather, synthesis of immunoglobulin (Ig)A by plasma cells stimulated at distal inductive sites dominate in the milk of rodents, humans, and swine whereas IgG1 derived from serum predominates in ruminants. Despite the considerable biodiversity in the role of the MG, IgG passively transfers the maternal systemic immunological experience whereas IgA transfers the mucosal immunological experience. Although passive antibodies are protective, they and other lacteal constituents can be immunoregulatory. Immune protection of the MG largely depends on the innate immune system; the monocytes–macrophages group together with intraepithelial lymphocytes is dominant in the healthy gland. An increase in somatic cells (neutrophils) and various interleukins signal infection (mastitis) and a local immune response in the MG. The major role of the MG to mucosal immunity is the passive immunity supplied to the suckling neonate.",1

"As the threat of exposure to emerging and reemerging viruses within a naive population increases, it is vital that the basic mechanisms of pathogenesis and immune response be thoroughly investigated. By using animal models in this endeavor, the response to viruses can be studied in a more natural context to identify novel drug targets, and assess the efficacy and safety of new products. This is especially true in the advent of the Food and Drug Administration's animal rule. Although no one animal model is able to recapitulate all the aspects of human disease, understanding the current limitations allows for a more targeted experimental design. Important facets to be considered before an animal study are the route of challenge, species of animals, biomarkers of disease, and a humane endpoint. This chapter covers the current animal models for medically important human viruses, and demonstrates where the gaps in knowledge exist.",1

"Group II, The single stranded DNA viruses, contains only one family of viruses that are pathogenic in humans: Class Parvoviridae. Class Parvoviridae contains environmentally resistant viruses that infect a wide range of animals. Parvoviruses are the smallest viruses currently known. Parvovirus B19 is the agent that causes fifth disease, so named because the diseases was the fifth type of common childhood exanthem among 6 rashes listed in most textbooks. Until the 1980s, no cause of this fifth listed exanthem was known; so it came to be known as “fifth disease”. Other names for fifth disease are erythema infectiosum and slapped face disease. Human herpesviruses 6 and 7 (Chapter 39) cause the sixth childhood rash, “sixth disease”. Keywords Hydrops fetalis, Fifth disease, Erythema infectiosum, Slapped face disease, Transient hemolytic anemia, Aplastic anemia",1
"The Group IV viruses have a positive sense genome. Positive sense RNA can be translated directly into protein, without a DNA intermediate and without creating a complementary RNA strand. To replicate its genome, though, a complementary DNA strand is required. The positive RNA strand serves as a template for an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, yielding a complementary RNA strand, to form a dimer with the template strand. The double-stranded RNA subsequently serves as the template for a new positive sense genome. The positive strand RNA genome is independently infectious, for most Group IV viruses. This means that in the absence of a capsid, envelope, or enclosed proteins, the RNA molecule, when inserted into a cell, is capable of using host cell machinery to construct additional viruses. There are six subclasses of the Group IV single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses: Picornaviridae, Togaviridae, Coronaviridae, Hepeviridae, Caliciviridae, Flaviviridae, and Astroviridae. As expected, within each class, viruses share structural similarities; but there are no properties, other than the defining property of a (+)-sense single stranded RNA genome, that extends to all six classes of the Group IV viruses. For example, some classes have envelopes (i.e., Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, Coronaviridae), and others do not (i.e., Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae, Hepeviridae, and Astroviridae).

"Advances in diagnostics, drugs, and devices have revolutionized cardiology practice, and improved quality of life of the patients. However, awareness, achievements, and advances in cardiac health care have enhanced the demands and expectations of the community, which lacks awareness about the social, economic, administrative, professional, and technical constraints or limitations of implementation. Being unfamiliar with medical ethics and legal aspects of care, and suboptimal virtues among physicians, have led to patients and the public utilizing legal remedies. In addition, sophistication of medical practice, increasing costs of health care, involvement of insurance systems, increased awareness and high expectations from the community and patients, and increased participation of the media have altered the attitude toward claiming compensation and acquisition of health care delivery among the public. In view of the changing trends of consumers and emerging areas in health care, providers must get accustomed to patient empowerment and come up to their expectations. Interactive programs on these aspects in medical education will help students understand not only the intricacies of medical ethics and the laws and shortcomings of health professionals and/or health systems, but also strengthen their knowledge of ethics and laws to improve their practice. Principles of ethics and legal issues have to be discussed at every stage of medical education. To improve the quality of the physician–patient encounter, we need to develop formal and informal curricula about effective communication skills. This chapter also highlights preventive measures and educational aspects of cardiology practice.",1
"Recent years have witnessed the development and advancement of many nonparenteral biologics and vaccines for human use. This chapter discusses various nonparenteral routes of administration. The oral route of administration is the most preferred and patient compliant method of them all. Transdermal, buccal, and pulmonary routes are also discussed. We have developed novel technologies using nanoparticles and microparticles to deliver vaccines by the oral and transdermal route of administration. These new technologies enable the formulation of vaccine particles containing vaccine antigens, without loss of their biological activity during the formulation process. Also, multiple antigens, targeting ligands and adjuvants can all be encapsulated within the same particle. When administered orally, these particles are designed to withstand the acidic environment of the stomach and are targeted to the Peyer’s patches and the gut-associated mucosal immune system. Because these vaccines are particulate in nature, they are readily taken up by phagocytic antigen presenting cells (APCs), such as M cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages in the Peyer’s patches of the intestines, resulting in a strong immune response and antibody production. Of particular interest is the fact that the particles release the antigen in a slow and sustained manner over a prolonged time period, intracellularly into APCs, resulting in strong mucosal and systemic immunity after oral administration, without the need for added adjuvants that are typically present in current vaccine preparations. Because no needles are required for oral vaccines, this method of vaccine delivery is inexpensive and suitable for mass vaccination in the developing world as well as for the developed world. This chapter discusses studies conducted on a wide array of vaccines, including infectious disease vaccines and cancer vaccines. This method of vaccine delivery enables the delivery of a wide spectrum of vaccines for prophylactic and therapeutic use, including oral and transdermal vaccines for cancer such as human papillomavirus, melanoma, ovarian, breast, and prostate with encouraging results. With respect to cancer therapy, a comparison is made between the conventional cancer therapy and immunotherapy. With a wide range of nanocarriers available for delivery of biologics, vaccines, and cancer therapies, nanotechnology not only has gained the well-deserved limelight but has also attracted the attention of regulatory bodies, although it presents certain challenges that must be considered before marketing such nanocarriers.",1

"MERS-CoV infection is an emerging infectious disease with a high mortality rate. The exact incidence and prevalence of the disease is not known as we do not have yet reliable serologic tests. The diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection relies on detection of the virus using real-time RT-PCR. Currently, the origin of the virus and the source is not known and future studies are needed to elucidate possible sources and the best therapeutic options.",1
"Pertussis (whooping cough) is the most frequent vaccine-preventable disease in children less than 5 years old in industrialized countries and has become much more prevalent over the time since the acellular pertussis vaccine replaced the whole cell biologic. The infection has increased in different age groups and all of these groups can impact on the frequency of disease in infants. It is this group that contributes most of the significant morbidity and mortality of pertussis. The microbiological, clinical, diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive aspects of Bordetella pertussis infection in man are reviewed and the reasons for this increase in cases including vaccine and pathogen issues are examined.",1

"Nonhuman primates (NHPs) have been used extensively during the past four decades for research and nonclinical development because they are close to humans in terms of genetics, anatomy, physiology, and immunology. They have been widely used in the development of infection models, leading to the generation of vaccines and drugs, as well as in the nonclinical pharmacologic and toxicologic assessment of biopharmaceuticals, especially in the fields of immunotherapy and oncology, despite the constant pressure to move to lower species. In many cases, NHPs are the only species that allows a correct risk assessment for humans. Nevertheless, limitations inherent to each species have to be considered before an investigation. This chapter shines some light on the respective interests and limitations of using cynomolgus monkeys, rhesus monkeys, and marmosets in medical research and nonclinical development, with a specific focus on reproduction and immunology.",1
"This chapter tells why it is important to study soil–plant–water relations. Water is the most important substance necessary for food production. People depend upon plants for food, so the challenge of feeding a growing population is discussed. The human population growth curve, a logarithmic one, is presented. Rules of logarithms are then given. A calculation is done to show that the human population is limited by the productivity of the land. The calculation shows that it requires two square yards (16,700cm2) to feed one person. The sigmoid plant growth curve is presented followed by a mathematical analysis of Blackman's compound interest law for plant growth. Finally, data from corn and soybean are analyzed to show that their growth rate is exponential. A biography of Napier, the inventor of logarithms, is given in the appendix.",1
"The development of early guidance documents for safe work with biological hazards was driven in part by the efforts of the life sciences community itself and in part by federal agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health. However, developments in the late 1990s through the present day have prompted a dramatic expansion in the generation of specific federal regulations, with the most obvious example being the Federal Select Agent Regulations. This chapter focuses on identifying the most widely accepted guidance documents and key regulations pertaining to research with biological hazards, including guidance on proper containment and handling of biological hazards, importation of biological agents, and safe work with bloodborne pathogens, recombinant and synthetic nucleic acids, and select agents and toxins.",1
"Public health seeks to improve health at a population level through interventions that increase the net health benefit to the population as a whole. Advances in genomics knowledge and technologies can add to this endeavor, but also pose a challenge when faced with often conflicting public health (population) and genomic medicine (individual) perspectives. Combining the fields of genomic, population, and social sciences, population genomics or public health genomics looks at the promotion of health and prevention of disease using genomic knowledge through the lens of populations rather than individuals. In this chapter we will survey the three major disciplines contributing to population genomics (genomics, population, and social sciences) and explore two cross-cutting issues: global health and population versus individual health, using specific examples from diseases such as asthma, colon cancer, and cystic fibrosis.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter deals with proteolytic enzymes of the viruses of the family picornaviridae. The picornaviral 3C proteinases constitute an ideal target for the rational design of antiviral drugs. The chapter discusses the chymotrypsin-like cysteine proteinases, which constitute a unique class of enzymes with a distinct substrate specificity, and are so far only found in +RNA viruses. Within these viruses the 3C proteinases perform a central and indispensable role during the viral life cycle and 3C proteinase inhibitors have the potential to limit the spread of viral infections. The chapter concludes that there is a wealth of experimental information available for the best-studied examples of the viruses of the Picornaviridae. This information provides an opportunity to design inhibitors against the viral 3C proteinase. Effective inhibitors of the picornaviral 3C proteinase have the potential to become effective antiviral drugs against human diseases such as the common cold, HAV, enteroviral infections, and diseases caused by related + RNA viruses.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the proteinases involved in plant virus genome expression. The chapter focuses on virus-encoded proteinases. It gives an overall view of the use of proteolytic processing by different plant virus groups for the expression of their genomes. It also discusses that the development of full-length cDNA clones from which infectious transcripts can be produced either in vitro or in vivo, has facilitated the functional analysis of the plant virus proteinases. In spite of the high specificity of the viral proteinases, cellular substrates for animal virus proteinases have been described in this chapter. The activity of the viral proteinases can interfere with important cellular processes to favor virus replication. The recent use of proteinase inhibitors in AIDS therapy has emphasized the convenience of virus-encoded proteinases as targets of antiviral action. A mutant protein able to inhibit the activity of the TEV proteinase by manipulation of the α2-macroglobulin bait region was designed by Van Rompaey.",1
"Publisher Summary Many pathogens have been reported to cause disease in the laboratory rat. This chapter concentrates on the pathology of the more common pathogens of the laboratory rat. Based on serologic surveys, parvo viruses are some of the most common viral pathogens in wild and laboratory rat. In general, there are three main serogroups, including Rat virus (RV), H-1 virus, and Ratparvovirus (RPV). Both RPV and RV are tropic for many of the same tissues and they both may result in a persistent infection. However, RPV is antigenically and genetically distinct from RV, and it apparently does not cause clinical signs or lesions in infant rats. M. pulmonis causes natural disease in rats and mice. The infection in young rats is usually clinically silent. In older rats, there are nonspecific clinical signs such as snuffling, chromodacryorrhea, and face and ear rubbing. Several bacteria of the genus Streptococcus can cause clinical disease in rats. All of the streptococci of concern in rats are Gram-positive cocci, and are catalase-negative, nonfermentative, and generally nonmotile. Cilia-associated respiratory bacillus has been identified in rats. In rats, infection is usually asymptomatic although nonspecific clinical signs, such as weight loss and dyspnea, may be observed.",1
"Publisher Summary Only experimental animals of a good microbiological quality will give any kind of guarantee of an experiment undisturbed by health hazards. It is for this reason that so-called (specific pathogen free) SPF animals are used for animal experiments. Certain requirements are necessary to maintain the desired SPF organism. Physical barriers together with appropriate operating methods aim at preventing contamination with pathogens and penetration by wild rodents. As a consequence, barrier units are not easily accessible for personnel, which is sometimes considered a disadvantage by experimenters. Finally, monitoring programs help to detect and control potential sources of contamination and may therefore be of crucial importance for the management of a facility housing animals of a good microbiological quality. The main purpose of health monitoring is to detect or prevent infections, which might influence physiological characteristics of animals or their health. Appropriate health monitoring helps to avoid imprecise results and allows all the experiments necessary to be carried out with a minimum number of animal. It is found that sufficient number of animals have to be monitored to obtain relevant information on a given population. It is important that the monitoring must be performed on a regular basis to detect unwanted microorganisms in good time. The recommended frequency is every 12 week.",1

"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the cell culture procedures as an invaluable tool in diagnostic medical virology. Culture of cells in monolayers is the most common method used in diagnostic virology laboratories. Primary or secondary cultures cells retain their diploid chromosome number, a factor which makes them particularly susceptible to certain viruses. The ideal cell system for a diagnostic virology laboratory would be a continuous line which retained its diploid chromosome number. It would be impossible in a routine laboratory to inoculate each specimen into every type of cell culture. A routine procedure is therefore employed and the specimen is inoculated into three types of cells which will support the growth of as many viruses as possible. Mixed culture technique (cocultivation) has proved of value when a viral agent is difficult to isolate from the original tissue, for example, isolation of measles from a brain biopsy. Cultures of chopped tissues have been used for many years to support the growth of viruses but the techniques were not readily applicable to diagnostic virology. A simple method of cultivating fragments of ciliated epithelium was described, which resulted in the isolation of new rhinoviruses and a new member of the corona virus group.",1

"Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on three human CNS demyelinating diseases—namely, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), also known as postinfectious encephalomyelitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and multiple sclerosis (MS). These three diseases have very different clinical courses and distinctive pathological features, although all share the essential element of demyelination. ADEM and PML have antithetic modes of pathogenesis. ADEM is a predominantly extraneural infection resulting in a virus-induced host autoimmune response, whereas PML is a direct lytic infection of oligodendrocytes in an immunocompromised host. It is clear that a diverse array of viruses can infect the human central nervous system. The viral infections can result in a wide variety of clinical and pathological symptoms. While some viruses may cause widespread inflammation and neurodegeneration, other viruses may remain latent in the CNS and only produce pathological changes during reactivation. Viral induced demyelination can occur both from direct infection of the myelin-producing oligodendrocytes, as in PML, or by indirect mechanisms that have yet to be determined. The outcome of a viral CNS infection depends not only on viral characteristics, but also on the interaction between virus and host cell.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter reviews two of the most widely studied animal models of virus-induced demyelinating disease. These are Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus and murine hepatitis virus. Both viruses produce acute inflammatory encephalitis that is followed by chronic central-nervous-system (CNS) demyelinating disease. The clinical and pathologic correlates of virus-induced demyelination are largely immune mediated. Furthermore, several pathologic mechanisms have been proposed to explain the development of myelin damage and neurologic deficits, and each of the proposed mechanisms may play a role in disease progression depending on the genetic constitution of the infected animal. The induction of demyelinating disease by virus may be directly relevant to human MS. Several viruses are known to cause demyelination in humans and viral infection is an epidemiologic factor that is consistently associated with clinical exacerbation of MS. It is suggested that viral infection may be a cause of MS, although no specific virus has been identified as a causative agent.",1

"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the current and future applications of monoclonal antibodies against bacteria in veterinary medicine. It discusses the existing applications of monoclonal antibodies, including the use of pilus-specific monoclonal antibodies for passive immunization of calves and piglets against enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) infections as well as the development of rapid diagnostic test kits for field diagnosis of EPEC infections. The potential applications of monoclonal antibodies for passive immunization against a variety of veterinary pathogens are passive immunization against Moraxella bovis (pinkeye), Bacteroides nodosus (foot rot), EPEC enterotoxin (enteric colibacillosis), Pasteurella haemolytica (pneumonic pasteurellosis), and Streptococcus equi (strangles). Three main areas of application for monoclonal antibodies against bacterial antigens in veterinary medicine are passive immunization, improved immunodiagnostics, and immunotherapy. Monoclonal antibodies, because of their specificity, unlimited availability, and high titer, represent excellent passive immunizing agents. However, their potential usefulness in preventing infection must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.",1

"Publisher Summary This chapter describes the procedures of purification, concentration, and preservation of antigens. The most general concept to begin with is the most important—the microbiological purity of the starting viral culture. For every virus antigen, there should be a parallel normal antigen to serve as the negative control in the test. Normal antigens are prepared by shaminoculating cell cultures with negative culture material and following these cultures through the entire virus culture and antigen preparation steps in exact parallel fashion. Depending on the test and the day-to-day usage, many antigens are preserved by adding thimerosal to the final product to a final concentration of 1:10,000, or sodium azide to a final concentration of 0.1%. Special preparation of antigens is required for many diagnostic tests, monoclonal or polyclonal antibody production, and many enzyme immunoassays tests. Many viruses and antigens have their own peculiarities based on the specific properties of each virus group. Chromatography is considered to be the most effective means of producing purified preparations of virus proteins, this being achieved by gel filtration, ion exchange, or affinity chromatography.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter describes the proven methods of purifying enveloped versus non-enveloped viruses and labile versus stable viruses as these properties constitute important differences in the methods. The chapter also discusses those criteria used by various laboratories for determining the degree of purity achieved in virus preparations. Viruses need to be purified for many studies in which properties or structure of the virus must be distinguished from those of the host cells or culture medium, such as analyses of structure of viral polypeptides and function of membrane glycoproteins. Ultracentrifugation is the usual technique of choice for the purification of particles of defined size from their contaminating materials. Caesium chloride is one of the materials of choice used for the purification of viruses by a technique referred to as buoyant density-gradient sedimentation, isopycnic centrifugation, or equilibrium density gradient centrifugation.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter provides a detailed methodology of some of the basic electron microscopic (EM) techniques currently used in virology. The chapter is subdivided into four sections: a general introduction, negative staining procedures, thin sectioning procedures, and briefly scanning EM. Following a brief discussion of the principles, each technique is given in the chapter in sufficient detail to be followed as a recipe. Modifications are included within the methodology. The size, equipment, and organization of an EM unit naturally vary according to the service requirements. There are some basic requirements that need to be considered. Immune electron microscopy is the visualization of the reaction between an antigen, usually a virus, and an antibody and is used to detect either component of this reaction. Thus, the technique has been used to detect serological responses to such viruses as Norwalk virus. The technique has assisted in the identification of rubella virus and been diagnostically used to identify Hepatitis B virus infection and viruses associated with diarrhea.",1

"Publisher Summary Business continuity planning (BCP) is a methodology for planning how to deal with unforeseen disruptions in financial business processes. These disruptions are expected to be of a large scale, such as the disaster of September 11, only 5% of the time; more often than not, disruptions are minor and on a much smaller scale. These smaller disruptions may be due to short-term power outages, fires, disk drive failures, or computer viruses. Regardless, the firm must make a plan based on a thorough analysis of all scenarios that may affect its normal working, and create and test contingency and recovery measures for such situations. This chapter discusses the salient parts of a BCP, which constitutes a strategy for recovering from sudden and unexpected disruption of critical business functionalities. Business continuity and disaster recovery became more important after the occurrence of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York, which led to widespread failure in financial systems. Developing a business continuity and disaster recovery plan requires setting aside resources and treating the development of the plan as a project for the firm. Once the analysis has been conducted and strategies have been formulated, the plan must be tested using simulated emergency scenarios. These scenarios are also important when it comes to industry-wide testing, which has become more of a focus recently as firms in financial sectors across the world become more deeply interlinked. While it is crucial for each firm to have its own business continuity plan, it is just as important for the industry as a whole to protect its infrastructure, since systems of each firm are intricately linked together in an STP environment.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on the naturally occurring viral diseases of rabbits. Poxviruses cause several important diseases in domestic and wild mammals and birds. Infection with poxviruses usually results in relatively mild disease involving the skin of the infected animals, however, generalized and often fatal disease may also occur, for example, in myxomatosis in rabbits. Close antigenic relationships exist among many poxviruses derived from different animal species. In spite of close antigenic relationships, the poxviruses of rabbits that produce distinct disease syndromes are discussed as separate entities. Virus of the genus Papillomavirus cause papillomas in various animal species and includes two rabbit viruses, the cottontail rabbit papillomavirus and the rabbit oral papillomavirus. The genus Polyomavirus contains one virus of rabbits, the rabbit kidney vacuolating virus. Papillomatosis of wild cottontail rabbits is characterized by the presence of horny warts, usually on the neck, shoulders, or abdomen. The warts begin as red raised areas at the site of infection, grow to become typical papillomas with rough rounded surfaces, and may later develop into large, keratinized horny growths. The rabbit kidney vacuolating virus was isolated in primary rabbit kidney cell cultures from papillomas of cottontail rabbits collected in Kansas. This virus causes vacuolar cytopathic effects in cell cultures. The virus resembles the cottontail rabbit (Shope) papil lomavirus but is a distinct virus. It does not produce papillomas when inoculated into rabbits and does not immunize rabbits against rabbit papillomavirus.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter reviews the anatomy and physiology of the rabbit eye from a comparative perspective. The anatomy of the rabbit eye reflects its niche as a diurnal herbivore. The rabbit has both photopic and scotopic vision without the benefit of a tapetum. Orbits are laterally situated; the rabbit is one of the few animals in which the orbital axis coincides with the visual axis. The shape of the orbit is circular, compared to the cone shaped human orbit. The orbital walls are of bone, except inferiorly, where the wall is formed partially by the muscles of mastication. The superior orbital wall is formed by the frontal bone. The supraorbital process of the frontal bone contains three supraorbital foramina, which are unique feature of the rabbit orbit; the foramina are incisures formed into apertures by a cartilaginous sheet. The optic foramina share a common canal anteriorly with only a thin boney plate to divide them, which disappears posteriorly to form one canal opening into the cranium as a single foramen. Entropion in young rabbits can occur as a primary or as a secondary condition arising from infection. Viral-induced eyelid proliferations can result from infection by the rabbit myxoma and papilloma viruses. The papilloma virus is a part of the papovaviridae and is a DNA virus transmitted by arthropod vectors. The cottontail rabbit in the mid-western United States is most frequently affected, although domestic rabbits are susceptible.",1

"Publisher Summary Viral infections probably initiate a large percentage of childhood and adult asthmatic attacks based on a history of preceding 'cold', high rates of viral isolation during attacks with lower rates of isolation during symptom-free intervals, and peaks of hospital admissions for asthma coinciding with viral epidemics. Although PCR technology provides a much more sensitive and specific method for detecting viral nucleic acids, its role in diagnosing active viral infection has been only partially explored. The PCR screening procedure for nine common respiratory viruses was performed on lung tissue obtained from both asthmatic and non-asthmatic patients. Six additional cases (four lifetime non-smokers and two with remote minimal smoking histories) were added to control for the fact that both the asthmatics and non-asthmatics smoked heavily. Data from two viruses (the adenovirus and RSV) are used to discuss the possible role of latent and persistent viral infection in the pathogenesis of chronic lung inflammation.",1

"Publisher Summary Cell damage has profound effects if it is the endothelial cells of small blood vessels that are involved. When bacteria invade tissues, they almost inevitably cause some damage, and this is also true for fungi and protozoa. Cell and tissue damage are sometimes due to the direct local action of the microorganism and microbial toxins. They either interfere with the transcription, translation, and DNA synthesis or change the permeability of the cell membrane. Some of the indirect damage brought about by these microbes is through inflammation and immune responses. Host cells are destroyed or blood vessels injured as a direct result of the action of microbes or their toxins. Inflammatory materials are liberated from necrotic cells, whatever the cause of the necrosis. Also many bacteria themselves liberate inflammatory products and certain viruses cause living infected cells to release inflammatory mediators. The expression of the immune response necessarily involves a certain amount of inflammation, cell infiltration, lymph node swelling, even tissue destruction. Sometimes they are very severe, leading to serious disease or death, but at other times they play a minimal part in the pathogenesis of disease. Other indirect mechanisms of damage include stress, hemorrhage, placental infection, and tumors.",1

"Publisher Summary Interferon alpha (IFN-α) is a mixture of closely related proteins, termed “subtypes,” expressed from distinct chromosomal genes. Interferon β (IFN-β) is a single protein species and is molecularly related to IFN-α subtypes, although it is antigenically distinct from them. IFN omega (IFN-ω) is antigenically distinct from IFN-α and IFN-β but is molecularly related to both. The genes of three IFN subtypes are tandemly arranged on the short arm of chromosome 9. They are transiently expressed following induction by various exogenous stimuli, including viruses. They are synthesized from their respective mRNAs for relatively short periods following gene activation and are secreted to act, via specific cell surface receptors, on other cells. IFN-α subtypes are secreted proteins and as such are transcribed from mRNAs as precursor proteins, pre-IFN-α, containing N-terminal signal polypeptides of 23 hydrophobic amino acids (aa) mainly. Pre-IFN-β contains 187 aa, of which 21 comprise the N-terminal signal polypeptide and 166 comprise the mature IFN-β protein. IFN-ω contains 195 aa—the N-terminal 23 comprising the signal sequence and the remaining 172, the mature IFN-ω protein. At the C-terminus, the aa sequence of IFN-ω is six residues longer than that of IFN-α or IFN-β proteins. IFN-α, as a mixture of subtypes, and IFN-ω may be produced together following viral infection of null lymphocytes or monocytes/macrophages. The biological activities of IFNs are mostly dependent upon protein synthesis with selective subsets of proteins mediating individual activities. IFNs can also stimulate indirect antiviral and antitumor mechanisms, depending upon cellular differentiation and the induction of cytotoxic activity.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter presents the history of viral immunology. The use of viral components for vaccination has been the subject of experimental clinical trials with adenoviruses and influenza subunit vaccines are in current use. The effect of the production of antibodies against viral components during the course of infection is in vivo complement fixation, demonstrable in practice by the developing anti-complementary activity of serum. Other antibody reactions, which may or may not result in neutralization of infectivity, may play an important role in the production of lesions, especially in certain persistent viral infections. Immune complexes in which viral antigens rather than virions are involved may also play an important role in the pathogenesis of some acute infections, such as hemorrhagic dengue and in the glomerulonephritis found in several chronic viral infections. Indeed, antigenemia and the early formation of immune complexes, rather than viremia as such, may provide the pathogenetic basis for the fever and symptoms that mark the end of the incubation period in many generalized viral infections and the prodromal rash may have a similar explanation.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter provides an overview of the classification, description, hosts, key developments, diagnostic techniques, and diagnostic reagents for avian infectious bronchitis virus. Avian infectious bronchitis virus belongs to the family Coronaviridae; genus Coronavirus; and species Avian infectious bronchitis virus. The virus causes acute contagious respiratory illness and includes reproductive tissue disease in chickens. The hosts of avian infectious bronchitis virus are only chickens. Avian infectious bronchitis disease was first reported in the United States. Vaccines for this disease were developed in the 1950s and the economic impact diminished. The diagnostic techniques for avian infectious bronchitis virus are virus neutralisation (VN), agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID), fluorescent antibody (FA), compliment fixation (CF), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter provides an overview of the classification and description of the canine coronavirus, its hosts, the key developments regarding the virus, and the diagnostic techniques and reagents. Canine coronavirus causes diarrhea and vomiting in dogs. The hosts that are infected by the canine coronavirus include dogs and coyotes. It is a recognized disease of dogs. Although the virus was first isolated in 1971, the disease entity was reported in 1974. The experimental pathogenesis has been described. Immune electron microscopy (EM) may aid the diagnosis but as transmissible gastro-enteritis (TGE) virus may also react, viral isolation may be necessary for a definitive diagnosis. The diagnostic reagents include routine EM materials and virus isolation in A72 cells.",1
"Publisher Summary Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIP) is antigenically related with transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus of swine, canine coronavirus, and human coronavirus 229E. The virus causes a variety of clinical manifestations from effusive peritonitis to noneffusive central nervous system (CNS) or visceral organ involvement. The hosts that are infected by feline infectious peritonitis virus include domestic cat (subfamily Felinae), lion, leopard, jaguar (subfamily Pantherinae), caracal, and lynx (subfamily Lyncinae); antibodies have also been found in cheetahs (subfamily Acinonychinae). The standard indirect fluorescent-antibody (IFA) technique of demonstrating antibodies against FIP virus uses either the cryostat sections of organ tissues from FIP affected cats or TGE virus-infected porcine cells as antigen preparations. High antibody titers in the sera/ascitic fluids of animals showing disease symptoms are taken as a confirmation of the clinical/pathological diagnosis.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter provides an overview of the classification, description, hosts, key developments, diagnostic techniques, and diagnostic reagents for porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus. Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus belongs to the family Coronaviridae; genus Coronavirus; and species Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV). Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus causes two distinct syndromes; one is known as vomiting and wasting disease, and the other involves encephalomyelitis. The hosts of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus are pigs. Vomiting and wasting disease and encephalomyelitis were initially reported as two separate diseases in Canada in the late 1950s. Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus was isolated in 1962, and the common etiology of the two syndromes was shown in 1969. The diagnostic techniques for porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus are virus neutralisation (VN) and agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID).",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter provides an overview of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGE). This virus is a species that belongs to the family Coronaviridae and the genus Coronavirus. The virus causes severe fatal diarrhea in young piglets and usually a mild disease in adult pigs. Pigs, foxes, dogs, and cats are the hosts to the virus. TGE was first described in 1946 in the United States. Subsequently, it was found to be in many other countries. Live vaccines have been used for porcine transmissible gastroenteritis. Epizootiological studies that have been made on the disease reveal that it is possible that birds are involved as carriers of the disease. A profusion of methods of diagnosis has been reported in the literature for the disease. Agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID), virus neutralisation (VN), indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA), complement fixation (CF), microneutralization, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are some diagnostic techniques for the disease.",1

The virus had not occurred in Western Europe until very recently. Clinical entity of the virus was first described in 1951. Diagnostic techniques for the virus include fluorescent antibody, virus neutralization, and electron microscopy. A cell-mediated immunity in vitro technique has recently been found for the detection of the virus.",1

"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses detection and identification by immune electron microscopy (IEM) of fastidious agents associated with respiratory illness, acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis, and hepatitis A. For Norwalk gastroenteritis and hepatitis A, the IEM technique enabled not only the definitive visualization and identification for the first time of virus-like particles from individuals with these diseases but also enabled researchers to demonstrate for the first time the serological association of an identifiable virus-like agent with each of these diseases. The chapter also explains that a mixture of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and anti-TMV rabbit serum resulted in aggregation of the virus particles, whereas by contrast, such aggregation did not occur when the virus reacted with a control normal rabbit serum. T. F. Anderson and W. M. Stanley demonstrated the electron-microscopic specificity of the reaction by observing the lack of such reactivity between TMV and rabbit antiserum to tomato bushy stunt virus; and between tomato bushy stunt virus and anti-TMV rabbit serum.",1
"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the methods for the separation and characterization of leukocytes from the intestine. Intestinal immune mechanisms must be studied directly and incorporated into models based on the observations made using intestinal cells and not just systemic cells. Numerous reports in the literature compare and contrast mucosal and systemic responses; however, despite their tissue-specific variations, the different tissues do interact. The procedures used to isolate cells from gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) are traumatic or include enzyme digestion. A technique should be selected that is efficient yet gentle enough to provide viable and functional cells. Moreover, the cells contaminating leukocyte preparations can affect the functional assays. This necessitates that positive controls are put through the procedure or even added to intestinal pieces before isolation. If these cells demonstrate a positive response following this handling, then one is more confident of negative results observed in the isolated intestinal cells.",1

"Publisher Summary Various classes and subclasses of immunoglobulins have been recognized and their structures and properties elucidated. Interactions of T and B lymphocytes and macrophages in the induction of immune responses have been documented. Reactions of receptor immunoglobulins on B lymphocytes and the mechanism of synthesis of immunoglobulins in their progeny have been analyzed. Products of T lymphocytes activated by antigens and mitogens have been defined, and their effects on macrophages and other cells studied. Components of the complement system have been isolated and characterized, and the alternate path of activation of the complement system has been recognized. Less is known about the biologic importance of the cytotoxic system in which antibody sensitizes virus-infected target cells for destruction by non-specific effector (K) lymphoid cells. This has been shown to occur in vitro with herpesvirus-infected cells and could play a role in immunity and immunopathology. Model systems of viral infections should be useful in defining the importance of this phenomenon.",1

"Publisher Summary The emergence of new pathogens, or the concern about bioterrorism, has brought an added urgency to the development of more efficient and rapid methods to detect pathogens and predict their potential virulence. Till date, DNA testing in microbiology has been directed predominantly to the detection of organisms that are difficult to culture in vitro, or for various reasons the growth is unlikely. DNA analysis can be used successfully in infections in which there is a mix of pathogens. Apart from the straightforward diagnostic applications, DNA microbiological testing has been used to detect antimicrobial resistance or toxigenic forms of E. coli. More recently, the availability of DNA technology to quantitate HCV and HIV has been useful in planning and monitoring treatment. The pathogenesis of many infections, particularly viral ones, can also be realized from experimental strategies based on light and electron microscopy, cell culture and immunoassay. The advantages that are provided by DNA techniques include the ability to detect latent (non-replicating) viruses and to localize their genomes to nuclear or cytoplasmic regions within cells. Nucleic acid probe techniques (NAT) can also be manipulated to enable a broad spectrum of serotypes to be detectable. This is particularly valuable in those emerging infections where the underlying serotypes are unknown.",1

"Publisher Summary This chapter describes how the poor health of a laboratory animal can adversely the experimental models used in antimicrobial research. Concerns for the health of laboratory animals have mostly focused on spontaneous infections, although disease in laboratory animals may also be caused by genetic or environmental determinants. The presence of various pathogenic microorganisms may cause changes in the organs, resulting in difficulties in the interpretation of the pathological diagnosis included in the evaluation of many microbiological models. The immune system may be modulated by spontaneous infections in the absence of clinical disease. This effect may be either suppressive or activating or both at the same time, but on different parts of the immune system. Some microorganisms have a specific effect on enzymatic, haematological, and other parameters, which are monitored in the animal during an experiment. Organic function disturbances may change the outcome of the experiment without the knowledge of the scientist. Spontaneous infections in an experimental infection model may also compete with the experimental infection, which in the worst cases may fail. Microorganisms present in the animal may contaminate samples and tissue specimens, such as cells and sera. This may complicate the in vitro maintenance of cell lines, and may interfere with experiments performed on cell cultures or isolated organs. To avoid disease, microbial interference, and zoonoses, laboratory animals are produced according to a three-step principle, which include rederivation, barrier protection, and health monitoring. Rederivation means the production of animals to initiate breeding colonies by either caesarian section or embryo transfer.",1
"The history and development of infectious disease genomics have been closely associated with the Human Genome Project (HGP) during the past 20years. It has been emphasized since the beginning of the HGP that such effort must not be restricted to the human genome and should include other organisms including mouse, bacteria, yeast, fruit fly, and worm for comparative sequence analyses. A brief history is reviewed in this chapter. As of 2016, more than 7000 completed genome sequencing projects have been reported. One of the important motivations for these efforts is to develop preventative, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies through the analysis of sequenced microorganisms, parasites, and vectors related to human health. A number of examples are discussed in this chapter.",1
"The host–vector–pathogen interactions are governed since their origin by a subtle balance between attack and transmission strategies and defense mechanisms. Molecular dialogues are established between a pathogen and its host, these ones will generate a mutual selection pressure that will result in profound changes in expression of host and pathogen genes. In the post-genomic era, proteomics is in its infancy, but represents a promising tool to fill the blanks that still exist in biology despite the sequencing of the genomes of many organisms. This chapter presents the interest in proteomics toward a better understanding of host–vector–pathogen cross talks through a synthetic review of the available data generated by proteomics studies, discussing the pitfalls of current approaches, and presenting new approaches to decipher from molecular interactions with population proteomics leading to biomarkers discovery for diagnosis, therapy, and vaccine purposes.",1
"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is the first major zoonotic infectious disease of the 21st Century. The disease, originally termed “atypical pneumonia,” was first recognized in November 2002 in Guangdong Province, China, which spread rapidly to 26 countries within 5months and eventually led to 8096 human infection cases and 774 deaths. A previously unrecognized coronavirus, named SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was later identified as the causative agent of SARS. Subsequent investigation indicated that the source of the human infections originated most likely from infected wildlife animals traded in the live animal markets, with masked palm civets considered the most prominent and important carrier. Large-scale culling of civets appeared to be effective in preventing further outbreaks in the region. Subsequent epidemiological studies showed that civets are intermediate host of SARS-CoV and bats are the likely natural reservoir of SARS-CoV and a large number of SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs). Detailed analysis of the massive SARS-CoV genomic sequence data indicated that SARS-CoV experienced a strong selection pressure during different outbreak phases in humans as well as interspecies transmission from animals to humans. The spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV plays a key role in virus–host interaction and hence is a key determinant of interspecies transmission. It has been shown that minor changes of amino acid (aa) residues in the S protein could lead to dramatic changes in virus susceptibility in animal and human hosts. This chapter focuses on the genetics and evolution of SARS-CoVs and SL-CoVs in humans, civets, and bats. The events of SARS outbreaks and the accompanying response activities highlight the importance of modern molecular epidemiology in disease investigation and the urgent need to broaden the screening and investigation of unknown viruses in wildlife animals.",1

"The infectious autopsy is the postmortem examination of a decedent who is likely to have a serious infectious disease that can be transmitted at autopsy. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), viral hepatitis B and C, and tuberculosis infections are common in forensic autopsy populations. Autopsy and laboratory personnel are at risk for acquiring these postmortem infections. As the autopsy often is essential to determine the cause and manner of death and/or help the living, the use of certain standard precautions can minimize the risk of occupational infections. This chapter reviews frequently encountered occupational infections and provides preventive measures including postexposure management.",1
"The world has celebrated over 100 years of powered flight. In December 1903, on a very windy beach in North Carolina, USA, Wilbur and Orville Wright successfully designed, built, and flew the first powered aircraft. In the air for only seconds, it marked the beginning of modern aviation. In just a short time span, aviation has progressed to high-altitude flight, flight at supersonic speeds, and flight to space and back. Aviation is integrated into our modern world and has blurred the boundaries of countries, enhanced business and communication across the world, and become an integral part of military operations. Much has been learned in a century of flight, including the importance of aeromedical factors on the safety of flight.",1
"Appropriate precautions are critical to minimize damage to the body during recovery and removal from a scene and transit to the mortuary to allow for accurate interpretation of injury and the minimization of contamination. Many elements of the investigation may be affected by the way in which tasks are conducted. Members of numerous jurisdictions must all work together to ensure the best outcome both from a forensic point of view and also in preserving and respecting the dignity of the deceased. This chapter will outline the techniques necessary for preserving the body and associated evidence during transport, including specific considerations for different types of cases.",1
"Serious reportable or notifiable diseases are discussed in the context of the International Health Regulations 2005 and its historical development. The relevance of these Regulations and the local legislative reporting requirements to forensic practitioners is outlined and an example of the local reporting requirements in Victoria, Australia is provided.",1
A large number of sudden and unexpected deaths are caused by infections. Bacterial and viral infections remain the most common causes of sudden death from infectious diseases. Sudden deaths resulting from infectious causes involving the cardiovascular system are commonly reported due to myocarditis and infective endocarditis while sudden deaths involving the respiratory system are mostly due to pneumonia and tuberculosis. Detailed medicolegal investigation is warranted in sudden deaths due to infectious diseases involving a thorough autopsy and histopathological evaluation along with the use of microbiology and molecular diagnostic methods.,1

"Identifying the root of a phylogenetic tree is important because incorrectly rooted phylogenetic trees may mislead evolutionary and taxonomic inferences. Many techniques for inferring the root have been proposed, but each has shortcomings that may make it inappropriate for any particular dataset. Here we outline the various ways to root phylogenetic trees, which include: outgroup, midpoint rooting, molecular clock rooting, and Bayesian molecular clock rooting. In addition, we discuss the pros and cons and also list software availability for each of the rooting methods.",1
"Infectious disease epidemiology makes use of mathematical models and molecular typing methods to probe pathogen transmission. Models and the basic reproductive number R 0 are a powerful tool for understanding disease dynamics and the impact of interventions, while genetic methods to characterize infectious agents give us an increasingly highly resolved picture of transmission over the short term of outbreaks, and the longer term of international spread. These two approaches are complementary, and are being combined in an approach termed ‘phylodynamics’ which aims to understand disease dynamics by the analysis of genetic data.",1
"This article discusses how evolutionary and ecological factors interact to affect the epidemiology of emerging infectious diseases. It further explains how the nascent field of phylodynamics constructs mathematical models, which link evolution and epidemiology, to study pathogen transmission. To illustrate the importance of considering both evolution and ecology – along with the utility of the phylodynamic approach – when studying novel pathogens, the author considers examples from HIV, influenza, and Ebola.",1

"The basic principle of international cooperation is to establish bilateral and multilateral efforts to leverage the human, scientific and financial resources and the knowledge and experience of other key regulatory authorities to avoid duplication of efforts, to make activities more efficient and to allow the focussing of limited resources on higher-risk areas of concern. This increased cooperation between worldwide regulators has necessitated proactive deliberate efforts towards convergence/harmonisation of regulation, practices and requirements to eliminate or reduce differences. Cooperation and harmonisation of standards in the pharmaceutical domain are already a reality and have become increasingly important during recent decades, with a high level of commitment to these activities by all stakeholders. The worldwide Drug Regulatory Authorities (DRAs) have been working to end an isolationist attitude that cannot resolve current worldwide issues and challenges caused by an ever increasing globalisation. As a result, many cooperation and harmonisation initiatives have been established at the bilateral, regional and global levels as a response to the changing geo-economic-political situation. The spectrum of collaboration varies from simple informal technical cooperation to full integration of systems and regulations. Indeed, all these initiatives can be very different in scope (some are part of a broader harmonisation initiative), level of harmonisation (depending on the political support/commitment), organisation (well-structured versus simple discussion) or advancement (established process vs. pilot projects), but they all work towards convergence of requirements and/or practices. All these multiple worldwide cooperation and harmonisation programmes have evolved rapidly over the past decades. This book section provides the current status of this complex and broad phenomenon of cooperation, convergence and harmonisation in the pharmaceutical sector. It reviews all major global, regional and bilateral cooperation initiatives.",1
"Cooperation and harmonisation of standards in the pharmaceutical domain is already a reality and, in fact, has been increasingly important in recent decades. This harmonisation seems natural and logical in the current environment of increased globalisation imposed by the current geo-economic-political situation. However, even though this is a reality, it is important to analyse whether or not all stakeholders benefit from this increased cooperation and harmonisation, in order to recommend future actions or potential improvements. Cooperation, convergence and harmonisation is indeed not an end in itself. Elimination of differences, agreement on common standards and the increase of cooperation are needed to protect and promote global public health. It is therefore very important to thoroughly analyse the value and impact of the harmonisation and cooperation process, and to determine whether or not all the efforts made throughout the years have indeed met expectations. After many years of experience, it seems important to have a thorough evaluation to answer several important questions: ▸ What has been the benefit of the multiple harmonisation and cooperation initiatives so far? ▸ Should such processes continue? Are there any other alternatives to resolve current challenges? ▸ Should current initiatives and projects be improved? If so, how and what are the priorities? ▸ Would greater harmonisation and closer cooperation be beneficial? Is it possible? Is it necessary? What are the limits of this process? ▸ What are the important lessons from the past and the on-going harmonisation initiatives that should be considered for planning the next steps? This book section’s goal is to answer these important questions by thoroughly evaluating the added value of cooperation, convergence and harmonisation. This book section also reviews the critical parameters and influencing factors for cooperation, convergence and harmonisation. This review/analysis of critical parameters and influencing factors is essential to understand the complexity of the situation and effectively discuss how to organise the next steps of global cooperation.",1

"While the role of viral variants has long been known to play a key role in causing variation in disease severity, it is also clear that host genetic variation plays a critical role in determining virus-induced disease responses. However, a variety of factors, including confounding environmental variables, rare genetic variants requiring extremely large cohorts, the temporal dynamics of infections, and ethical limitation on human studies, have made the identification and dissection of variant host genes and pathways difficult within human populations. This difficulty has led to the development of a variety of experimental approaches used to identify host genetic contributions to disease responses. In this chapter, we describe the history of genetic associations within the human population, the development of experimentally tractable systems, and the insights these specific approaches provide. We conclude with a discussion of recent advances that allow for the investigation of the role of complex genetic networks that underlie host responses to infection, with the goal of drawing connections to human infections. In particular, we highlight the need for robust animal models with which to directly control and assess the role of host genetics on viral infection outcomes.",1
"Dust storms move an estimated 500–5000Tg of soil through Earth’s atmosphere every year. Dust-storm transport of topsoils may have positive effects such as fertilization of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and the evolution of soils in proximal and distal environments. Negative effects may include the stripping of nutrient-rich topsoils from source regions, sandblasting of plant life in downwind environments, the fertilization of harmful algal blooms, and the transport of toxins (e.g., metals, pesticides, herbicides, etc.) and pathogenic microorganisms. With respect to the long-range dispersion of microorganisms and more specifically pathogens, research is just beginning to demonstrate the quantity and diversity of organisms that can survive this type of transport. Most studies to date have utilized different assays to identify microorganisms and microbial communities using predominately culture-based, and more recently nonculture-based, methodologies. There is a clear need for international-scale research efforts that apply standardized methods to advance this field of science. Here we present a review of dust-borne microorganisms with a focus on their relevance to agronomy.",1
"The discovery of RNA interference (RNAi) in mammalian cells has created a new class of therapeutics based on the reversible silencing of specific disease-causing genes. This therapeutic potential depends on the ability to deliver inducers of RNAi, such as short-interfering RNA (siRNA) and micro-RNA (miRNA), to cells of target tissues. This chapter reviews various challenges and delivery strategies for siRNA, with a particular focus on the development of lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery technologies. Currently, LNP delivery systems are the most advanced technology for systemic delivery of siRNA, with numerous formulations under various stages of clinical trials. We also discuss methods to improve gene silencing potency of LNP-siRNA, as well as application of LNP technologies beyond siRNA to the encapsulation of other nucleic acids such as mRNA and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR).",1

Human adenovirus (Ad) has been used extensively to develop gene transfer vectors for vaccine and gene therapy applications. A major factor limiting the efficacy of the current generation of Ad vectors is their inability to accomplish specific gene delivery to the cells of interest. Transductional targeting strategies seek to redirect virus binding to the appropriate cellular receptor to increase infection efficiency in selected cell types to achieve therapeutic intervention. These efforts mainly focused on incorporating targeting ligands by means of chemical conjugation or genetic modification of Ad capsid proteins and using bispecific adapter molecules to mediate virus recognition of target cells. This review summarizes current progress in Ad tropism modification maneuvers that embody genetic capsid modification and adapter-based approaches that have encouraging implications for further development of advanced vectors suitable for clinical translation.,1
"Many nonhuman adenoviruses (AdVs) of simian, bovine, porcine, canine, ovine, murine, and fowl origin are being developed as gene delivery systems for recombinant vaccines and gene therapy applications. In addition to circumventing preexisting human AdV (HAdV) immunity, nonhuman AdV vectors utilize coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor or other receptors for vector internalization, thereby expanding the range of cell types that can be targeted. Nonhuman AdV vectors also provide excellent platforms for veterinary vaccines. A specific nonhuman AdV vector when used in its species of origin could provide an excellent animal model for evaluating the vector efficacy and pathogenesis. These vectors are useful in prime–boost approaches with other AdV vectors or with other gene delivery systems including DNA immunization and viral or bacterial vectors. When multiple vector inoculations are required, nonhuman AdV vectors could supplement HAdV or other viral vectors.",1
"In the past decade adenovirus-based vaccines have progressed from preclinical studies, which universally showed the vectors’ high immunogenicity, to testing in humans. Clinical trials showed that adenovirus vectors are well tolerated by humans. They induce robust immune responses that can be expanded by booster immunization. The effect of preexisting neutralizing antibodies on vectors’ immunogenicity appears to be less severe than was observed in experimental animals and can readily be circumvented by using vectors to which most humans lack neutralizing antibodies. Additional clinical studies are needed to firmly establish the efficacy of adenoviral vector vaccines.",1
"Airport Emergency Planning, Part II provides an overview of the core functions within airport emergency management, which include command, control, and communications (C3) and law enforcement, firefighting, public notification, emergency medical response, and resource management. Many airport emergencies require public notifications and, in some cases, Protective Actions, such as evacuation and shelter-in-place. Police, fire, and other Emergency Medical Services (EMS) comprise the core first responders to nearly any emergency, and these personnel have numerous responsibilities throughout the Airport Emergency Plan (AEP). The National Incident Management System, created after 9/11, is the standard method of managing disasters, incidents, and other events in the United States. It is based on three principles: Incident Command System (ICS), Multi-Agency Coordination, and Public Information. The five functions of ICS are command, operations, planning, logistics, and finance/administration. For some incidents, an intelligence/investigative function is added.",1
"A review of the relevant foodborne viruses is presented. Published data from scientific journals as well as the data presented in official reports and published on the Internet were used for this review. In the review, information is given for the main foodborne viruses, implicated virus species, and food matrices involved, some history data are given, as well as modes of transmission, and sources of the virus presence in food. Results of surveys on the presence of viruses in different kind of foods commodities (fresh produces and shellfish) and in some cases connections to caused outbreaks are presented. Also, possible zoonotic infection and implicated viruses that could be transmitted through food are given. Human Norovirus followed by hepatitis A virus are the most common foodborne viruses, which are transmitted by food consumed raw, such as shellfish, fresh vegetables, and berry fruit. In developed countries, hepatitis E virus is increasingly being recognized as an emerging viral foodborne pathogen that includes zoonotic transmission via pork products. The existing knowledge gaps and the major future expectations in the detection and surveillance of foodborne viruses are mentioned.",1

"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Although the precise etiology of MS remains unclear, CD4+ T cells have been proposed to play not only effector but also regulatory roles in MS. CD4+ T cells can be divided into four subsets: pro-inflammatory helper T (Th) 1 and Th17 cells, anti-inflammatory Th2 cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs). The roles of CD4+ T cells in MS have been clarified by either “loss-of-function” or “gain-of-function” methods, which have been carried out mainly in autoimmune and viral models of MS: experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus infection, respectively. Observations in MS patients were consistent with the mechanisms found in the MS models, that is, increased pro-inflammatory Th1 and Th17 activity is associated with disease exacerbation, while anti-inflammatory Th2 cells and Tregs appear to play a protective role.",1
"In well-resourced settings, early infant diagnosis and administration of life-saving antiretrovirals (ARVs) have significantly improved clinical outcomes in pediatric human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The dramatic increase in survival rates is associated with enhancements in overall quality of life, which reflect a multidisciplinary, holistic approach to care. Current optimism starkly contrasts with the outlook and prognosis two decades ago, when failure to thrive and wasting syndrome from uncontrolled pediatric HIV infection resulted from poor oral intake, malabsorption, chronic diarrhea, and a persistently catabolic state. The tenets of care developed from that era still hold true in that all infants, children, and adolescents with HIV require comprehensive nutritional services in addition to effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). This chapter will review the principles of nutrition in the pre- and post-cART eras and discuss the etiologic factors associated with malnutrition, with an emphasis on interventions that have favorably impacted the growth and body composition of infants, children and adolescents with HIV.",1
"Genetic variation is a necessity of all biological systems. Viruses use all known mechanisms of variation: mutation, several forms of recombination, and segment reassortment in the case of viruses with a segmented genome. These processes are intimately connected with the replicative machineries of viruses, as well as with fundamental physico-chemical properties of nucleotides when acting as template or substrate residues. Recombination has been viewed as a means to rescue viable genomes from unfit parents, or to produce large modifications for the exploration of phenotypic novelty. All types of genetic variation can act conjointly as blind processes to provide the raw materials for adaptation to the changing environments in which viruses must replicate.",1
"Viral population numbers are extremely large compared with those of their host species. Population bottlenecks are frequent during the life cycle of viruses and can reduce viral populations transiently to very few individuals. Viruses have to confront several types of constraints that can be divided in basal, cell-dependent, and organism-dependent constraints. Viruses overcome them exploiting a number of molecular mechanisms, with an important contribution of population numbers and genome variation. The adaptive potential of viruses is reflected in modifications of cell tropism and host range, escape to components of the host immune response, and capacity to alternate among different host species, among other phenotypic changes. Despite a fitness cost of most mutations required to overcome a selective constraint, viruses can find evolutionary pathways that ensure their survival in equilibrium with their hosts.",1
"Experimental evolution permits exploring the effect of controlled environmental variables in virus evolution. Several designs in cell culture and in vivo have established basic concepts that can assist in the interpretation of evolutionary events in the field. Important information has come from cytolytic and persistent infections in cell culture that have unveiled the power of virus-cell coevolution in virus and cell diversification. Equally informative are comparisons of the response of viral populations when subjected to different passage régimes. In particular, plaque-to-plaque transfers in cell culture have revealed unusual genotypes and phenotypes that populate minority layers of viral quasispecies. Some of these viruses display properties that contradict features established in virology textbooks. Several hypotheses and principles of population genetics have found experimental confirmation in experimental designs with viruses. The possibilities of using experimental evolution to understand virus behavior are still largely unexploited.",1
"Viruses spread to give rise to epidemics and pandemics, and some key parameters that include virus and host population numbers determine virus persistence or extinction in nature. Viruses evolve at different rates of evolution depending on the polymerase copying fidelity during genome replication. Calculated rates of evolution in nature vary depending on the time interval between virus isolations. In particular, intra-host evolution is generally more rapid that inter-host evolution and several possible mechanisms for this difference are considered. The mechanisms by which the error-prone viruses evolve render very unlikely the operation of a molecular clock (constant rate of incorporation of mutations in the evolving genomes). Several computational methods are reviewed that permit the alignment of viral sequences and the establishment of phylogenetic relationships among viruses. The evolution of virus in the form of dynamic mutant clouds in each infected individual, together with multiple environmental influences, render the emergence and reemergence of viral pathogens an unpredictable event, another example of biological complexity.",1
"Medical interventions to prevent and treat viral disease constitute evolutionary forces that may modify the genetic composition of viral populations that replicate in an infected host, as well as those that expand at the epidemiological level. Strategies intended to minimize vaccination and treatment failures are proposed, and justified based on fundamental features of viral dynamics. The recommended use of complex, multiepitopic vaccines and combination therapies as early as possible after initiation of an infection falls under the general concept that complexity cannot be combated with simplicity. It follows also that socio-political action to interrupt virus replication and spread as soon as possible is as important as scientifically sound treatment designs to control viral disease on a global scale.",1
"Viral populations are true moving targets regarding the genomic sequences to be targeted in antiviral designs. Experts from different fields have expressed the need of new paradigms for antiviral interventions and viral disease control. This chapter reviews several strategies that aim at counteracting the adaptive capacity of viral quasispecies. The proposed designs are based on combinations of different antiviral drugs and immune modulators, or in the administration of virus-specific mutagenic agents, in an approach termed lethal mutagenesis of viruses. It consists of decreasing viral fitness by an excess of mutations that render viral proteins sub-optimal or non-functional. Viral extinction by lethal mutagenesis involves several sequential, overlapping steps that recapitulate the major concepts of intra-population interactions and genetic information stability discussed in preceding chapters. Despite the magnitude of the challenge, the chapter closes with some optimistic prospects for an effective control of viruses displaying error-prone replication, based on the combined targeting of replication fidelity and the induction of the innate immune response.",1

"The virus was first described 120 years ago as a filterable, transmissible agent that causes disease in plants and animals. A virus is a “submicroscopic and intracellular parasite” that can propagate only inside a living cell. The obligatory nature of a virus brought a debate on whether it is living or nonliving. Virology, as a discipline that studies the diverse aspects of viral infection of host cells and its consequence, became established during the early 20th century. Viruses are found in almost all living organisms on earth, ranging from bacteria, fungi, and amoeba, to plants and animals. Viruses are classified into seven groups, according to genomic features. This molecular classification, also called the “Baltimore classification,” allows us to predict precisely the mode of viral genome replication.",1
"Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites. Viruses must gain entry into target cells and usurp the host cellular machinery to produce a progeny virus. The multiple steps involved in the virus propagation occurring inside cells are collectively termed the “virus life cycle.” After entering the cell and localizing to an intracellular milieu, the virus sheds its capsid, transcribes its RNA, translates its RNA to the viral proteins, replicates its genome, assembles the viral components, and finally exits from the cell. Here, the steps involved in the virus life cycle are described with emphasis on entry and exit.",1
"A number of methodologies are currently available for viral diagnosis and basic research, ranging from immunological methods, such as ELISA, to molecular methods, such as PCR-based diagnosis. Other immunological methods include immunofluorescence assay and immunoblot. In addition, some classical methods, such as plaque assay and hemagglutination, are still utilized in laboratories. Tissue culture is conveniently used for virus cultivation and propagation. Experimental animals are used for studies involving viral pathogenesis. Density gradient centrifugation is used for the purification of virus particles. Finally, molecular methods are used for the genetic analysis (ie, mutation) of viral gene function by using the replicon.",1
"Three miscellaneous positive-strand RNA viruses are described briefly with an emphasis on the genome structure: caliciviruses, togaviruses, and coronaviruses. Unlike those described in the two preceding chapters, these RNA viruses possess one or more subgenomic RNAs, besides the full-length genomic RNA. These subgenomic RNAs are all positioned to the 3′ side of the RNA genome and encode structural proteins. Importantly, viruses belonging to these three RNA virus families have become a global public health concern. Noroviruses, a prototype of calicivirus, are responsible for almost all viral gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide. Moreover, some newly emerging viruses belong to togaviruses and coronaviruses. Chikungunya virus, an emerging virus that caused an outbreak in Africa during 2004–2006, belongs to the togavirus family. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, which caused 2003 SARS outbreak in China and 2014 MERS outbreak in the Middle East, belong to the coronavirus family.",1
"In this chapter, four miscellaneous negative-strand RNA viruses are covered briefly with emphasis on the genome structure: paramyxoviruses, filoviruses, bunyaviruses, and arenaviruses. Paramyxoviruses and filoviruses belong to the order Mononegavirales, having one negative-strand RNA genome, while bunyaviruses and arenaviruses belong to the order Multinegavirales, having a multiple negative-strand RNA genome. Sendai viruses are the prototype of paramyxoviruses and Ebola virus is the prototype of filoviruses, while hantavirus is the prototype of bunyaviruses and Lassa virus is the prototype of arenaviruses. Notably, many newly emerging viruses belong to these negative-strand RNA viruses, including Nipah virus, Ebola virus, and Hantavirus. Finally, reoviruses are described, although reoviruses are formally classified as double-strand RNA viruses.",1
"Newly emerging viruses such as the Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-coronavirus, and the avian influenza virus are serious threats to public health and have become a global concern. The swine flu pandemic which occurred in 2009 reminded us of the Spanish flu that killed over 40 million people. Newly emerging viruses could be either a novel previously undescribed virus or a variant of a previously known virus. Examples of the novel viruses include HIV, the Ebola virus, and SARS viruses. Variants of previously described viruses are also called “remerging viruses.” They are mutants of known viruses but cause new epidemics with considerable virulence. The influenza virus that caused the 2009 swine flu pandemic was a variant of an existing virus.",1

"Malaria has affected human health globally with a significant burden of disease, and also has impeded social and economic development in the areas where it is present. In Africa, many countries have faced serious challenges in controlling malaria, in part due to major limitations in public health systems and primary health care infrastructure. Although China is a developing country, a set of control strategies and measures in different local settings have been implemented successfully by the National Malaria Control Programme over the last 60 years, with a low cost of investment. It is expected that Chinese experience may benefit malaria control in Africa. This review will address the importance and possibility of China–Africa collaboration in control of malaria in targeted African countries, as well as how to proceed toward the goal of elimination where this is technically feasible.",1
"Natural products are the basis of treatment since the dawn of human civilization, and modern medicine has gradually developed, over the years, by scientific and observational efforts from traditional medicine. Today most of the synthetic drugs showed adverse and unacceptable side effects, however, impressive bioactivities with reduced toxicities were reported for many botanicals against several chronic or difficult-to-treat diseases. A whole range of viral diseases including human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome, Rabies, Dengue, and Herpes need effective drugs. Considerable research has been carried out on the pharmacognosy, chemistry, pharmacology, and therapeutics of traditional medicines of diverse cultures, and many pharmaceutical companies have renewed their strategies for antiviral drug development where no effective drugs or vaccine exist. Thus, phytochemicals with antiviral potentials need to be studied in depth with standardization, chemical isolation, effectivity, molecular mechanism, along with in vivo toxicity and efficacy to reduce cost and time. This review will portray the scientific approaches and methodologies used for the development of antiviral leads from traditional medicines against selected genetically and functionally diverse viral infections.",1
"The properties of herbal medicines are related to certain classes of compounds such as alkaloids, flavonoids, essential oils, and others. During the last four decades, near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy (800–2500nm; 12.500–4.000/cm) has become one of the most attractive and widely used methods for analysis rather than traditionally applied separation methods (including liquid chromatography and electrophoresis) for the following reasons: NIR spectroscopy is a noninvasive analytical tool allowing a fast and simultaneous qualitative and quantitative characterization of herbal medicines and their constituents. Infrared imaging techniques are becoming more and more attractive to understand the function and the biochemical composition of plant tissue. In this contribution, the principle, technique, and methodology are described, followed by a discussion of quantitative and qualitative application possibilities. Finally, some hints to helpful regulatory issues are summarized.",1
"Respiratory tract infections are actually a spectrum of diseases associated with infection of both the upper and lower respiratory tract and include the common cold, otitis media, influenza-like illness, croup, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. Viruses are the most common cause of respiratory tract infection and the viruses associated are more diverse than the respiratory diseases they cause with influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses, adenovirus, rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, and human coronavirus having a major role. It is often difficult to clinically differentiate viral and bacterial etiologies for some respiratory diseases. Nucleic acid amplification assays provide a rapid and extremely sensitive means to detect respiratory viruses. Understanding the biology and pathogenesis of the associated viruses is key to understanding diagnostic testing limitations.",1
"It was widely believed in the late 1960s that infectious diseases had been conquered by vaccines and antibiotics and humans were no longer under threat by microbial pathogens. Yet, since that time more than 60 pathogens have been discovered that can cause serious emerging infectious diseases. Molecular methods have played critical roles in the discovery, monitoring, and clinical diagnostics of emerging pathogens. In this chapter, we present well-recognized emerging pathogens. We provide examples of the utility of molecular assays in research and clinical care of emerging infectious diseases. We also discuss some theoretical and practical limitations of molecular tests and the future prospects of expanding molecular diagnostics for emerging pathogens based on new advances of knowledge and technologies.",1

However, all viruses must attach to a susceptible host cell, enter the cell, disassemble the virus particle (uncoating), replicate its own genetic material and express the associated proteins, assemble new virus particles, and escape from the infected cell (release).

"Viruses have several common characteristics: they are small, have DNA or RNA genomes, and are obligate intracellular parasites. The virus capsid functions to protect the nucleic acid from the environment, and some viruses surround their capsid with a membrane envelope. Most viruses have icosahedral or helical capsid structure, although a few have complex virion architecture. An icosahedron is a geometric shape with 20 sides, each composed of an equilateral triangle, and icosahedral viruses increase the number of structural units in each face to expand capsid size. The classification of viruses is very useful, and the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses is the official body that classifies viruses into order, family, genus, and species taxa. There are currently seven orders of viruses.",1
"As obligate intracellular parasites, viruses are completely dependent upon a host cell for their replication. They use energy generated by the host cell, and they exploit the host's machinery to manufacture viral proteins. Many of the cell's organelles, as well as the plasma membrane, are involved in viral replication processes. The organelles involved in protein synthesis, processing, and transport—namely the ribosome, rough endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi complex—are utilized in the manufacture of viral proteins, as well, and viruses use ATP generated by the host cell's mitochondria. The plasma membrane, made of a phospholipid bilayer, is the cell's primary zone of contact with the extracellular world. As such, it is the first obstacle that a virus must overcome for entry into a cell. The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology states that DNA is replicated to create more DNA, DNA is transcribed into mRNA, and mRNA is translated by ribosomes to create proteins. All viruses are dependent upon the host's translation machinery, and many viruses will use other portions of the cell's replication and transcription mechanisms. DNA polymerase is the major enzyme involved in DNA replication, while RNA polymerase creates messenger RNA. Host ribosomes translate the messenger RNA into proteins, composed of amino acids. Viruses also have many unique strategies to ensure the translation of their proteins over host proteins.",1
"To continue the chain of infection, a virus must undergo the process of replication to create new, infectious virions that are able to infect other cells of the body or subsequent hosts. After gaining entry into the body, a virus makes physical contact with and crosses the plasma membrane of a target cell. Inside, it releases and replicates its genome while facilitating the manufacture of its proteins by host ribosomes. How this is carried out depends upon the type of viral nucleic acid. Virus particles are assembled from these newly synthesized biological molecules and become infectious virions. Finally, the virions are released from the cell to continue the process of infection.",1
"For transmission of a virus to occur, a virus must enter a host through a portal of entry, replicate or disseminate within the host, and be transmitted to a new host through a portal of exit. Unless delivered directly into bodily tissues through a bite or needle, most viruses interact with the epithelium at the site of entry. Localized infections replicate at the initial site of infection, while systemic infections spread to additional areas of the body. Viruses are shed into the environment most often through the same route they entered the body. The stability of virions within the environment is dependent upon virion and environmental factors. Epidemiology is the study of how diseases are transmitted through a population. Epidemiologists perform descriptive or analytic studies to characterize the chain of viral infection throughout a population and design control measures to interrupt it.",1
"Diagnostic tests are paramount in determining the etiology of viral infections. Direct diagnostic methods assay for the presence of the virus, while indirect methods test for effects of the virus. Cell culture is the process of growing cells or tissues in the laboratory. Cell lines can be infected with patient samples to allow viral replication within the cells; observable cytopathic effects can help to identify the identity of the virus. Infected cells can also be used for immunofluorescence assays, which use fluorescently labeled virus-specific antibodies to identify viruses in fixed cells or tissues. A variety of diagnostic immunoassays exist, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays/enzyme immunoassays, western blots, lateral flow immunoassays, and agglutination reactions. Assays that detect viral nucleic acids are based upon the principles of PCR or nucleic acid hybridization, are extremely sensitive, and are specific for a particular virus.",1
"An emerging infectious disease (EID) is defined as a disease caused by a pathogen that has not been observed previously within a population or geographic location. Viruses are a major cause of EIDs, particularly −ssRNA viruses. Many variables are involved in the emergence or reemergence of viruses. These can be classified into human factors, environmental/ecological factors, and viral factors and include urbanization, globalization, weather and climate change, and the genetic composition of the virus. The great majority of emerging viral diseases are zoonoses, notably transmitted by arthropods and nonhuman mammals. Flaviviruses include several notable vector-transmitted viruses, while rodents and bats are thought to be the natural reservoirs of arenaviruses and filoviruses, respectively. This chapter discusses several notable outbreaks of emerging and reemerging viruses, including the 2014–15 outbreak of Ebolavirus in West Africa.",1

"This chapter profiles some examples of past and current viral infections that have levied a high toll in human misery and mortality, and derives a number of lessons about the dynamics of viral pandemics. Viral epidemics can be very disruptive to civil society, and—conversely—civil disasters can trigger viral epidemics. Furthermore, viruses likely play an insidious role in initiating a number of chronic diseases whose burden is ever increasing. Evolving technologies have led to much more rapid detection of emerging viral diseases anywhere in the world. However, current efforts to mitigate the toll of viral diseases are less than satisfactory, and futurists predict the emergence of new pandemics particularly of zoonotic origin. Pathogenesis—the subject of this book—informs ongoing efforts to mitigate the toll of viral disease.",1
"Viral pathogenesis seeks to understand how a virus interacts with its host at multiple levels. Key questions include the source (an infected human, animal, or insect vector), the transmission mechanism, and how the virus is shed and transmitted. Following transmission, pathogenesis is governed by the initial site of replication, whether the virus disseminates within the host, and its tropism for specific tissues and organs. In turn, these steps are dictated by the structure and replication strategy of the virus. In addition to utilizing selected synthetic biochemical pathways in the host cell, viruses frequently reprogram host cells by inducing intracellular signaling pathways that render the cell more permissive. Host–virus interactions also control whether the infection is acute, chronic, latent, or transforming; how the virus interacts with the immune system; and the consequent pathophysiological response of the host. This chapter provides an overview of these basic concepts of viral pathogenesis, with emphasis on the interactions of viruses with their host cells and organisms.",1
"The preceding chapters describe essential aspects of viral pathogenesis, including virus–cell interactions; viral spread within a host; and intrinsic, innate, and adaptive immune responses. This chapter extends the theme and addresses diverse patterns of viral infections that are determined by both the virus and the host. Thus, virulence or susceptibility depends upon the specific virus–host combination. This is particularly true in the case of persistent infections, which involve a delicate balance between virus and host. We will focus first on virus virulence and host susceptibility, and then turn to the complex variables that govern persistent infections. Chapters 4–6, on innate, adaptive, and aberrant immunity, and Chapters 11–15, on systems biology approaches, also provide important insights into the patterns of infection.",1
"Full evaluation of the interactions between a virus and host during infection and clearance requires a living organism. A live animal is also necessary for development of vaccines requiring evaluation of immunogenicity and an immune response that protects from challenge. Study of the natural host for the virus is ideal, but often not possible. Mice have emerged over the last 60 years as the most popular animal model for studying viral pathogenesis due to extensive genetic and immunologic characterization, wide availability of reagents, inbred and transgenic strains, and small size. However, responses in mice are not always predictive of those in the natural host. Other species commonly used include guinea pigs, ferrets, chickens, and nonhuman primates. When choosing an animal model for a study, factors to be considered include host susceptibility to the infection, animal size, cost, availability of housing and reagents, potential confounding coinfections, and ethical restrictions.",1
"Virologists have long known that viral pathogenesis must be studied from the standpoint of both the virus and the host. Nevertheless, given its relative simplicity, studying the virus has always been more tractable. As outlined in the previous chapters, virus-centric approaches have yielded a tremendous amount of information about viral genetics, viral replication cycles, and host and tissue tropisms. Along the way have come insights into host innate and adaptive immune responses and the many ways in which viruses antagonize these responses while exploiting other cellular processes to their advantage. The sequencing of the human genome, however, dramatically changed the field of viral pathogenesis. Virologists are now able to move beyond virus-centric or single-gene approaches and instead investigate the host response to infection on a genome-wide scale. In this chapter, we focus on the insights into viral pathogenesis that are provided by examining the host transcriptional response, including the dynamics of innate and acquired immunity, diagnostic signatures, and the identification of targets for antiviral drugs.",1
"While viruses encode a limited repertoire of factors, their influence on host proteins is substantial. Various high-throughput technologies have been employed to gain a global understanding of how viruses rewire cellular machinery to promote replication and evade immune responses. These approaches can elucidate the interplay that occurs between virus and host by identifying host factors that directly associate with viral proteins, determining what cellular factors impact the viral lifecycle and what viral countermeasures circumvent immune surveillance. This chapter will discuss system-level technologies that are used to identify host proteins, pathways, and biochemical complexes that govern viral pathogenesis. We will examine the information that can be gained from genome- and proteome-level analyses of host–pathogen interactions, the advantages and pitfalls of various methods and provide examples of significant breakthroughs that have been facilitated using OMICs-based technologies.",1
"Much of the focus of viral pathogenesis is on viral virulence factors; however, virulence can only be defined in the context of a virus–host combination. Furthermore, there is abundant evidence that highly pathogenic viruses have been selected for specific host genetic variants within the target population. The identification and mechanistic dissection of host genetic polymorphisms therefore has powerful implications for our understanding of viral diseases, including the identification of novel therapeutic targets. In this chapter, we review the classical approaches used to identify host allelic variations that regulate disease susceptibility. We also discuss next-generation molecular technologies and computational approaches that are poised to revolutionize our understanding of the impact of host genetic variation on viral diseases at the population level.",1
"Metabolism refers to the chemical reactions that occur in living cells, and the reactants and products of these reactions compose the metabolome. The lipidome is comprised by hydrophobic metabolites and includes several broad classes of structurally diverse molecules. Lipids supplied by the host cell are required for many viral processes, and many if not all viruses have evolved mechanisms to perturb host metabolism to promote viral replication. This chapter provides background and a framework for examining the role of lipid metabolites in viral processes and rational attempts to target host metabolism as an antiviral strategy.",1
"The emergence of a new viral disease is one of the most dramatic aspects of virology, which often receives widespread attention from the scientific community and the lay public. Considering that the discipline of animal virology was established over 100years ago, it may seem surprising that new virus diseases are still being discovered. How this happens is the subject of this chapter.",1
"Viral infection is a highly dynamic process, which lead to constant evolutionary changes on both sides of the viral–host interface. The high mutation rates of viruses, coupled with short generation times and large population sizes, allow viruses to rapidly adapt to the host environment. However, this high mutation rate also comes at a cost to the viral population, as deleterious mutations are constantly created, leading to a plethora of defective genomes. Here, we will discuss the basic tenets that govern the evolution of viruses: mutation rates, population size, selection, the multiplicity of infection, and how these factors modulate infection as viruses evolve within a host, during transmission to novel susceptible hosts, and as viruses establish infections in new host species.",1
"The science of epidemiology has been developed over the last 200years, using traditional methods to describe the distribution of diseases by person, place, and time. However, in the last several decades, a new set of technologies has become available, based on the methods of computer sciences, systems biology, and the extraordinary powers of the Internet. Technological and analytical advances can enhance traditional epidemiological methods to study the emergence, epidemiology, and transmission dynamics of viruses and associated diseases. Social media are increasingly used to detect the emergence and geographic spread of viral disease outbreaks. Large-scale population movement can be estimated using satellite imagery and mobile phone use, and fine-scale population movement can be tracked using global positioning system loggers, allowing estimation of transmission pathways and contact patterns at different spatial scales. Advances in genomic sequencing and bioinformatics permit more accurate determination of viral evolution and the construction of transmission networks, also at different spatial and temporal scales. Phylodynamics links evolutionary and epidemiological processes to better understand viral transmission patterns. More complex and realistic mathematical models of virus transmission within human and animal populations, including detailed agent-based models, are increasingly used to predict transmission patterns and the impact of control interventions such as vaccination and quarantine. In this chapter, we will briefly review traditional epidemiological methods and then describe the new technologies with some examples of their application.",1
"Antiviral therapy is one of the most exciting aspects of virology, since it has successfully employed basic science to generate very effective treatments for serious viral infections. Table 1 lists selected examples of those human viral diseases for which there are established antiviral drugs. Therapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has demonstrated that the potential impact antivirals can have on a lethal, chronic infection with lifesaving therapy administered to more than 12million individuals by 2015. This dramatic advance is about to be recapitulated for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The development of new antiviral drugs is very much a work in progress, with active drug discovery programs for filoviruses, coronaviruses, dengue, and others.",1
"Viral pathogenesis is a field in rapid evolution, reflecting the dynamic development of systems biology and the continuing introduction of new or improved methodologies. Therefore, this final chapter is dedicated to “futurism,” a look at what lies ahead for this field. We have recruited a number of scientists to write short pieces where they are free to speculate on future developments in their respective areas of expertise.",1

"Besides the major role of angiotensin II (Ang II) in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), other angiotensin peptides with different lengths were recently discovered to be biologically active and they possess individual receptors and signaling pathways. Ang III stimulates AT1 and AT2 receptors and its signaling pathway is similar to that of Ang II but has a specific role on aldosterone stimulation in adrenal cortex. The Ang(1–7)/Mas receptor axis is known to antagonize the effects of the AT1 axis. These include anti-hypertrophic action, anti-thrombotic and anti-fibrotic effect, and vasodilation via stimulation of NO synthesis in endothelium and potentiation of the bradykinin effect. Ang IV stimulates insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) or AT4 receptor and is involved in facilitation of memory such as reversing memory deficits caused by alcohol abuse and ischemia. AT4 antagonist decreases renal blood flow and increases urinary sodium excretion, and these effects are independent of the AT1 pathway.",1
"Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is well known for its dual actions in converting inactive Ang I to active Ang II and degrade active bradykinin (BK), which play an important role in the control of blood pressure. Since the bottle neck step is the production of pressor Ang II, this was targeted pharmacologically in 1970s and successful ACE inhibitors such as captopril were produced to treat hypertension. Researches on domain specific ACE inhibitors are continuing to produce effective hypertension controlling drugs with fewer side effects. ACE2 was discovered in 2000; it converts Ang II into Ang(1–7), thereby reducing the concentration of Ang II as well as increasing that of Ang(1–7), an important enzyme for Ang(1–7)/Mas receptor signaling. ACE2 also acts as the receptor in the lung for the coronavirus causing the infamous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003.",1

"Humans have been fighting disease since the dawn of civilization and will probably do so till its end. Every century has had its medical revolution. But the last century was special: we started to uncover the most fundamental biological mechanisms designed to keeps us healthy every second of our lives. The discoveries of these mechanisms, collectively referred to as the immune system, have had an unprecedented positive impact on human health. Understanding the nature of infectious diseases, the discovery of antibiotics and vaccination campaigns have already saved hundreds of millions of lives. And this is just the beginning.",1

"The history of virology can be traced as the personalities involved have described their concepts and published their experimental results. Although infections we now know as, e.g., rabies, yellow fever, smallpox, etc. were clinically evident in early human history, the initial isolation of individual viruses and their assignment to specific diseases did not occur until about 1898, 120 years ago, a proverbial drop in the bucket of time. Just one lifetime ago, Peter Medawar, awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology in 1960, defined viruses as a piece of nucleic acid surrounded by bad news.",1
"Viral pathogenesis describes the processes by which viral infections cause diseases and involves virus–host interactions at the cellular and systemic level that determine whether a virus will cause a disease, what form that disease takes, and how severe the disease will be. Though the pathogenesis of each virus is unique, there are several common points in the virus life cycle that are shared between all pathogenic viruses, and by considering these common aspects of the virus-induced disease process, we can explore some general concepts in viral pathogenesis while illustrating some of the virus specific processes that shape disease outcomes.",1
"Antibodies are major molecular effectors of adaptive immune responses. Most, if not all, biological activities of antibodies, however, depend on the functional properties of cells that express receptors for the Fc portion of antibodies (FcR). Most FcR are activating receptors; some are inhibitory. When engaged by antibodies and antigen, the various FcR expressed by a given cell trigger a mixture of positive and negative signals whose integration determines cellular responses. Responses of cell populations can be either protective or pathogenic. As a consequence, FcR are potential target/tools in a variety of diseases including infection, allergy, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.",1
"Blood transfusion is a lifesaving intervention that has an essential role in patient management within health care systems. It is the responsibility of governments to ensure that safe and sufficient supplies of blood are available and accessible to all patients requiring transfusion. The provision of safe and efficacious blood for transfusion involves a number of processes, including assessment of the suitability of prospective blood donors to donate blood, blood collection, processing, and testing of blood donations, and the issue of blood and its transfusion to the patients. While blood transfusion can be lifesaving, there are associated risks, particularly the transmission of blood-borne infections including human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B and C viruses. Screening for transfusion-transmissible infections (TTIs) to exclude blood donations at risk of transmitting infection from donors to recipients is a critical part of the process of ensuring that transfusion is as safe as possible. Effective screening for evidence of the presence of the most common and dangerous TTIs can reduce the risk of transmission to very low levels. Blood transfusion services should therefore establish efficient systems to ensure that all donated blood is correctly screened for the appropriate TTIs and that only nonreactive blood is issued for transfusion to patients.",1
"Antiviral agents are drugs approved in the USA by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment or control of viral infections. Available antiviral agents mainly target stages in the viral life cycle. The target stages in the viral life cycle are; viral attachment to host cell, uncoating, synthesis of viral mRNA, translation of mRNA, replication of viral RNA and DNA, maturation of new viral proteins, budding, release of newly synthesized virus, and free virus in body fluids. Two important factors that can limit the utility of antiviral drugs are toxicity and the development of resistance to the antiviral agent by the virus. In addition, host phenotypic behaviors toward antiviral drugs because of either genomic or epigenetic factors could limit the efficacy of an antiviral agent in an individual. This article summarizes the most relevant pharmacologic and clinical properties of current antiviral agents, and targets for novel antiviral agents.",1
"Zoonoses are the ‘diseases and infections that are naturally transmitted between vertebrate animals and man,’ as defined in 1951 by the World Health Organization (WHO) Expert Committee on Zoonoses. The word zoonosis (plural zoonoses) is the combination of two Greek words (zoon, animals and noson, disease), and was coined at the end of the nineteenth century by Rudolph Virchow to designate human diseases caused by animals. Nevertheless, the term should also include vertebrate animal diseases caused by exposure to humans, such as measles in non-human primates, which is of major concern in any major primate center. The term ‘zoonosis’ is also considered to be shorter and more convenient than ‘anthropozoonosis’ (animals to humans) and ‘zooanthroponosis’ (humans to animals), which are based on the prevailing direction of transmission between humans and other vertebrates.",1
"Biothreats are a high priority concern for public safety and national security. The field of microbial forensics was developed to analyze evidence associated with biological crimes in which microbes or their toxins are used as weapons. Microbial forensics is the scientific discipline dedicated to analyzing evidence from a bioterrorism act, biocrime, hoax, or inadvertent microorganism/toxin release for attribution purposes. Microbial forensics combines the practices of epidemiology with the characterization of microbial and microbial-related evidence to assist in determining the specific source of the sample, as individualizing as possible, and/or the methods, means, processes and locations involved to determine the identity of the perpetrator(s) of an attack.",1
"Astroviruses are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses. Their genomes contain three open reading frames, but the exact number of encoded proteins remains unknown. Astroviruses were originally identified in association with childhood diarrhea; subsequently, they have been identified as a common enteric virus infecting children under the age of 2. Infection is not restricted to humans, however, and astroviruses have been found in widespread mammalian and avian species. Generally, infection causes a mild, self-limiting gastroenteritis, although infection can result in nephritis, hepatitis, and encephalitis in certain host species. Astrovirus pathogenicity and immune response is only poorly characterized and may differ between mammalian and avian species. In this article, the current knowledge of astroviruses is reviewed, including their molecular virology, viral evolution, pathogenesis, and immune response.",1
"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses with characteristic spike glycoproteins that project outward like the rays of the sun (corona – Latin for ‘crown’), when visualized by electron microscopy. CoV are classified, together with the toroviruses, in the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales. All nidoviruses have a common genome organization and generate a nested set (nido – Latin for ‘nest’) of 3′ co-terminal mRNAs. CoVs have been isolated from a variety of species, including birds, livestock, domestic animals, and humans. CoV infections can cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurologic disease, depending on the strain of the virus and the site of infection. Importantly, CoVs have been shown to cross species barriers and have emerged from animal reservoirs to infect humans and cause severe disease. The CoV responsible for an outbreak of severe acute respiratory disease (SARS-CoV) in 2002–03 likely originated as a bat coronavirus which, during replication in an intermediate host (such as the palm civet), evolved to be able to infect humans efficiently. SARS-CoV infected over 8000 people with approximately 10% mortality rate before it was controlled by public health measures of isolation of infected individuals and contacts. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), first reported in 2012, is likely transmitted from camels to humans with potentially fatal consequences. To date, there are no approved vaccines or direct acting antiviral drugs to combat coronavirus infections in humans. The emergence or re-emergence of CoVs from animal reservoirs is a potential concern for public health.",1
"Virus laboratory diagnostics has an increasingly important role in modern patient care. Virological methods are needed to investigate the etiology of acute viral infection or the reactivation of a latent infection, as well as to follow virus load in antiviral treatments. Serological assays are also used for screening of blood products for the risk of certain chronic infections, evaluation of the immune status, and need for prophylactic treatments in connection with organ transplantations. For diagnostic purposes the following approaches can be used: demonstration of presence of infectious virus or its structural components directly from a patient's specimens or investigation of specific antibody response in serum specimens. Amplification techniques, most commonly polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is currently the workhorse of nucleic acid testing for the detection and quantitation of virus genomes. Virus isolation is used to demonstrate infectious virus in a patient's specimens, whereas virus antigens are investigated by antigen detection assays. Serological diagnosis is based on either the demonstration of the presence of virus-specific IgM antibodies or a significant increase in the levels and/or avidity of specific IgG antibodies. Immunoassays are the most commonly used serological assays. Point-of-care tests (POC tests), for antigens, antibodies, and also nucleic acids are also becoming more and more common in diagnostic use. In order to reach the best diagnostic efficiency for each patient it is important to select the most suitable method using the right sample collected at the right time.",1
"In the last two decades, a large number of new viruses have been discovered, many of which are pathogenic in humans or other vertebrates. Among the more important causes of virus emergence have been changes in human behavior, population, and increases in travel to distant countries. In addition, the application of new molecular technologies has led to the recognition of many viruses that hitherto went undetected. Many of the new, emerging viruses have an RNA genome, and many are zoonoses. The spread of human immunodeficiency virus, causing acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and the use of immunosuppressive drugs following transplant surgery, have increased the numbers of people in the population that are highly susceptible to emerging virus infections. The threat of a new pandemic of influenza virus in the human population stresses the need for development of better methods for detection, surveillance, and control of emerging virus diseases.",1
"Many viruses use the enteric tract as a route of entry to the human, animal or avian host. The onset of acute enteritis is associated with infection by viruses that replicate at or near the site of entry into the intestinal mucosa, including caliciviruses, rotaviruses, adenoviruses, astroviruses, and coronaviruses. These ‘enteric’ viruses occur globally and share similar features. Most are RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of mature absorptive epithelial cells lining the villi of the small intestine, leading to inflammation and villus atrophy. Vomiting and diarrhea can result in dehydration and death if untreated. Despite abundant growth in vivo, they initially proved difficult or impossible to grow in vitro. Most are genetically diverse, species specific, highly infectious within species and transmitted by the fecal-oral route. Severe symptoms are most commonly associated with primary infections of young animals, and are followed by short-lived immunity. Reinfections are common throughout life, but are often only mildly symptomatic. Safe and effective vaccines have been developed to prevent severe rotavirus disease in young children. In addition to these enterotropic viruses, enteric disease can also result from spread to the intestine of HIV or cytomegaloviruses during the later stages of systemic disease in immunocompromised hosts.",1
"Viruses are the leading causes of acute lower respiratory-tract infection in infancy. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common pathogen in severe disease, with hMPV, PIV-3, influenza viruses, and rhinoviruses accounting for the majority of the remainder of acute viral respiratory infections. Humans generally do not develop lifelong immunity to reinfection with these viruses; rather, specific immunity protects against severe and lower respiratory-tract disease.",1
"The concept of ‘innate immunity’ embraces all sorts of measures that exclude, inhibit, or slow down infections with little specificity and without adaptation or generation of a long-lasting memory. The mammalian innate immune defenses described in this article comprise defensins, the complement system, nonspecific phagocytic and cytolytic leukocytes (macrophages, monocytes, granulocytes, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells), and cytokines such as the antivirally active interferons. Since the type I interferon (IFN-α/β) system is our primary defense against viral infections, special attention will be paid to the virus-triggered induction of IFN transcription, the signaling activated by IFNs, and the antiviral factors expressed as a consequence",1
"Viruses are among the most common causes of opportunistic infection after solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SOT and HSCT). Viral infection is associated with both direct (invasive disease) and indirect (immune modulation) effects affecting susceptibility to other infections and promoting allograft rejection. The transplantation recipient is susceptible to a broad array of viral pathogens. Some may be transmitted with the allograft as donor-derived infections, while others result from exposure, either soon after the transplant or from more distant exposures when infection is latent and reactivates in the setting of immune suppression. Simultaneous infections with multiple viral or viral and nonviral pathogens are common. The risk for viral infection is a function of the intensity of exposure and virulence of the specific virus, the intensity of immune suppression used to prevent graft rejection or graft-versus-host disease, underlying immune deficits, and factors affecting host susceptibility. Studies of viral latency, reactivation, and of the cellular effects of viral infection will provide clues for future strategies in prevention and treatment of viral infections. This article covers specific issues relating to viral infection in SOT and HSCT; additional details regarding these viral infections are also found elsewhere in this text.",1
"Toroviruses are single-stranded RNA peplomer-bearing enveloped viruses producing enteric disease in animals and humans. They have a unique extracellular C-shape or open torus morphology. There are four species in the genus Torovirus (family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales): Equine torovirus (EToV), Bovine torovirus (BToV), Human torovirus (HToV), and Porcine torovirus (PToV), which have been reported worldwide. Their genome contains six ORFs, which are transcribed as a 3’-coterminal nested set of four mRNAs. ORF1a and 1b encode the replicase, and ORFs 2–5 encode the spike (S), membrane (M), hemagglutinin-esterase (HE), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, respectively. Only EToVs and BToV Aichi/2004 propagate in cell culture.",1
"Entry of enveloped viruses is mediated by viral glycoproteins that catalyze fusion of viral and cellular membranes. These viral glycoproteins need to be activated which leads to extensive conformational changes that trigger the insertion or attachment of a fusion peptide in or to cellular target membranes thus bridging two bilayers. Further refolding into a hairpin-like structure pulls viral and cellular membranes into close apposition, a process that leads to lipid bilayer fusion. Although viral fusion proteins belong to three different classes based on their structural organization, they follow similar structural principles to achieve fusion.",1
"The influenza viruses, which contain single-stranded RNA, are classified into three types, A, B, and C and belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family of viruses. Types A and B cause annual epidemics and often pandemics of influenza illness, while type C is a less common disease with fewer symptoms.",1
"The influenza viruses, which contain single-stranded RNA, are classified into 3 types, A, B, and C and belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family of viruses. Types A and B cause annual epidemics and often pandemics of influenza illness, while type C is a less common disease with fewer symptoms.",1
"Viral diseases and epidemics are occurring across the world with increasing frequency and with incidences of new and old viruses with renewed vigor. Traditional drugs and vaccines with their long developmental times, incidences of allergenic reactions, growth of resistant strains and other issues are proving inadequate to curb the menace. Advancements in computer science and technology, in genetics and immunology and the growth of the new science of bioinformatics are leading to a more focused approach in a new paradigm of vaccine design that challenges the traditional approach and promises to be more effective; lead times should get much shorter, preselection of peptide antivirals will be designed to preclude allergenic reactions, stability against mutational changes to viral strains will be much more assured, and coverage of immunological status will enable community-specific vaccines development. We outline in this article the basics of viruses, immune responses, and traditional vaccines and move on to describe the bioinformatics methods and development of new vaccines.",1
"Acute exacerbation is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Although the real nature of it is still not clear and there is no proven effective therapy, progress has been made since the consensus definition and diagnostic criteria were proposed. The trial results of several new innovative therapies in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have suggested a potential for benefit in acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, leading to double blind randomized clinical trials in this area. This article reviews the present knowledge on acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, focusing on the triggering factors and treatment.",1
"The use of specific care bundles to control infection has been demonstrated to be effective, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). However, the proposal of VAP rates as a quality indicator has generated debate due a lack of a gold standard definition. In 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) replaced surveillance definitions from VAP to other preventable conditions related to mechanical ventilation (ventilator-associated events: VAE), which may predict outcomes. This represents a new opportunity to overcome many of the weaknesses of traditional VAP surveillance and broadens the focus of surveillance encompassing other preventable conditions related to mechanical ventilation.",1
"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory infection, which ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia and multiorgan failure, caused by a novel coronavirus named Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Majority of cases have been reported from Saudi Arabia. MERS cases occur as sporadic cases or as clusters or hospital outbreaks. Dromedary camels are thought to be a host for MERS-CoV. Direct contact with dromedary camels within 14days prior to infection was identified as an independent risk factor for MERS. Diagnosis of MERS is based on a positive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), obtained from a respiratory specimen. The mainstay of management of MERS-CoV infection is supportive care. There is no specific antiviral therapy for MERS-CoV infection at present, although several modalities of treatment options have been examined or are under investigation.",1
"Pneumonia remains the main cause of morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases in the world. The important reason for the increased global mortality is the impact of pneumonia on chronic diseases especially in the elderly population and the virulence factors of the causative microorganisms. Because elderly individuals present with comorbidities, particular attention should be paid for multidrug-resistant pathogens. Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most frequently encountered pathogen. Enteric gram-negative rods, as well as anaerobes, should be considered in patients with aspiration pneumonia. Interventions for modifiable risk factors will reduce the risk of this infection. The adequacy of the initial antimicrobial therapy and determination of patients’ follow-up place is a key factor for prognosis. Also, vaccination is one of the most important preventive measures. In this section it was focused on several aspects, including the atypical presentation of pneumonia in the elderly, the methods to evaluate the severity of illness, the appropriate take care place and the management with prevention strategies.",1
"Cellular blood components include leukocytes, erythrocytes, and platelets. Leukocyte subtypes are neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. Red blood cell components include mature erythrocytes and reticulocytes. Increases or decreases in cell counts/concentrations for each of these blood components may occur in response to many stimuli or pathologic conditions, including stress, inflammation, infectious agents, neoplasia, and the toxic effects of endogenous, environmental, or pharmaceutical compounds. Changes may be limited to a few blood components or may be observed in all blood components depending on the stimulus. Morphologic alterations in blood components may also be observed in conjunction with alterations in blood cell counts. Specific examples of conditions that cause alterations in blood components are described, as well as the mechanisms by which many of these specific alterations occur. Many xenobiotics are able to cause similar alterations in blood components through the same or comparable mechanisms, and examples of xenobiotic-induced alterations in blood components are provided.",1
"Infections during pregnancy may affect a developing fetus. If left untreated, these infections can lead to the death of the mother, fetus, or neonate and other adverse sequelae. There are many factors that impact infection during pregnancy, such as the immune system changes during pregnancy, hormonal flux, stress, and the microbiome. We review some of the outcomes of infection during pregnancy, such as preterm birth, chorioamnionitis, meningitis, hydrocephaly, developmental delays, microcephaly, and sepsis. Transmission routes are discussed regarding how a pregnant woman may pass her infection to her fetus. This is followed by examples of infection during pregnancy: bacterial, viral, parasitic, and fungal infections. There are many known organisms that are capable of producing similar congenital defects during pregnancy; however, whether these infections share common mechanisms of action is yet to be determined. To protect the health of pregnant women and their offspring, additional research is needed to understand how these intrauterine infections adversely affect pregnancies and/or neonates in order to develop prevention strategies and treatments.",1
"Hepatitis is commonly associated with certain viruses labeled as “Hepatitis” viruses. However, many other viral infections can also affect the liver ranging from mild asymptomatic elevations of aminotransferases to fulminant hepatic failure. This article will provide a brief overview on a variety of different viral infections that may be associated with significant liver pathology at least under certain conditions, for example, immunosuppression. This overview discusses key virological features, clinical presentation of associated liver disease and provides some information on diagnosis and an outline of treatment options. Thus, the overview can provide first orientation when infectious hepatitis is encountered in a patient that cannot be explained by the usual hepatitis viruses.",1
"Every year, on a global basis, billions of cases of illness result from ingestion of microorganisms in drinking water. The majority of these illnesses are caused by fecal contamination, resulting in diarrhea. In places where access to medical care is not readily available, diarrhea can lead to death from dehydration; unfortunately, 1.5 million people, many of whom are children, die annually as a result. There are hundreds of pathogens that may be present in fecal material, making it not feasible to analyze water for all of them. Thus, the microbiological quality of water is monitored using indicator organisms, such as coliform bacteria, enterococci, and/or bacteriophages, which are much simpler and less expensive to detect. The use of indicators, while not perfect, has resulted in a decrease in the incidence of waterborne disease.",1
"This article is an overview of the most clinically important respiratory viruses including the recently emerged highly pathogenic coronaviruses and other viruses that are transmitted via the respiratory tract. In this article, we highlight a description of the agent, its life cycle, epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis and management of the infection. The viruses in this article are respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, seasonal and emerging coronaviruses, adenovirus, bocavirus and other viruses associated with the respiratory tract for their life cycle.",1
"As we transition to an era of personalized medicine, it has become imperative to integrate genomics with pharmacological and toxicological discoveries to provide individualized care to patients. Animal models are extremely important in understanding this interface as well as in bridging the gap between basic science discoveries and clinical medicine. The complex nature of pharmacological and toxicological research involving exposure to xenobiotic and therapeutic compounds necessitates the use of animal models to better understand how these compounds interact with multiple organ systems and cell types. As genomics has expanded, we have become increasingly aware of the impact an individual’s genetic makeup influences these responses. Novel methods have emerged that allow for the rapid development of animal models containing mutant alleles, allowing investigators to model these complex genetic interactions in a dramatically shortened timeline. In this chapter, we emphasize the methods and approaches that can be used in gene targeting, screening strategies, and a variety of genetically modified model organisms. The goal is to provide toxicologists an up to date review on the creation of genetically engineered animal models, which can be used to model genetic susceptibility to disease.",1
"Human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1, are traditionally known to cause symptoms of common cold with only moderate clinical impact. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), on the other hand, have strike humans in the past two decades as highly fatal human pathogens leading to considerable mortality and economic loss. This article summaries the updates on the structure, genome organization, replication and clinical features of human coronaviruses. Recent studies also shed light upon the zoonotic origin of emerging human pathogens including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, providing insight for future surveillance and intervention.",1
"Biological species, including viruses, change through generations and over time in the process known as evolution. Viruses may evolve at high, uneven, and fluctuating rates among genome sites. The accumulated changes, through either mutation or recombination with other species, are first fixed in the genome of successful individuals that give rise to genetic lineages. The relationship between biological lineages related by common descent is called ‘phylogeny’. For inferring phylogeny, the differences between aligned sequences of genomes and proteins are quantified and depicted in the form of a tree, in which contemporary species and their intermediate and common ancestors occupy, respectively, the terminal nodes, internal nodes, and the root. The tree is characterized by a topology, length of branches, shape, and the root position. A complex mathematical apparatus has been developed for phylogeny inference that can evaluate inter-species differences, facilitate tree building and comparison of trees, and assess the fit between data and tree through, typically, computationally intensive calculations. A reconstructed tree is an approximation of the true phylogeny that practically remains unknown. The phylogenetic analysis is used in applied and fundamental virus research, including epidemiology, diagnostics, forensic studies, phylogeography, evolutionary studies, and virus taxonomy. It can provide an evolutionary perspective on variation of any trait that can be measured for a group of viruses.",1
"Databases are critical to all scientific endeavours. They manage our email, funding, and scientific literature, and provide access to the ever-growing mountains of scientific data. In molecular virology, all researchers are familiar with performing BLAST searches of the DNA and protein sequence databases; however, in some respects these are simple databases tailored to this specific task. This collection of virus databases illustrates a greater diversity of purpose, but reveals they often function to support only one or a few virus families grouped by a common theme. The common characteristic is usually genome size as small RNA viruses are typically sequenced in vastly greater numbers and are much less complex than the large DNA viruses; they have variability at the level of SNPs rather than gene presence/absence. Here, we present the basics of database organization and aim to compare and contrast these features and the manner by which the databases are used by the scientific community.",1
"Zoonotic viral infections represent an important public health problem across the globe. Unlike infectious agents that are limited to humans, the presence of domestic and wild animal reservoirs and insect and arthropod vectors greatly complicate transmission dynamics and make control measures very difficult to implement. Some viral zoonoses are categorized as “emerging infectious diseases” because they are newly recognized or have shown significant changes in their geographic range and/or epidemiologic characteristics. This article provides updated information on the current status of the most important viral zoonotic diseases. The recent upsurge in Ebola virus infections in West Africa and the emergence of Zika virus in the Western Hemisphere are highlighted.",1
"This chapter describes how the impact of psychological trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) differ, depending on individual differences and the social and cultural context and culture-specific teachings and resources available to individuals, families, and communities. A social-ecological framework is used to differentiate the impact of exposure to traumatic stressors and the development of (or resistance to) PTSD, based on the individual’s or group’s (i) personal, unique physical characteristics, including skin color, racial background, gender, and sexual orientation; and (ii) family, ethnocultural, and community membership, including majority or minority group status, religious beliefs and practices, socioeconomic resources, and political and civic affiliations. While personal, familial, social, and cultural factors can be a positive resource contributing to safety and well-being, they also can be a basis for placing the person, group, or entire community or population in harm’s way or at heightened risk of developing PTSD.",1
Virtually all infections that affect man can manifest within the lung. Pulmonary infection is the leading cause of death worldwide. The approach to the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary infection requires a sound knowledge of both the microbial pathogens but also how the host immune system responds to infection.,1
"Angiotensin-(1-7) is a vasoactive peptide of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS), which is generated mainly by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and exerts its actions via activation of its receptor Mas. The Ang-(1-7)/ACE2/Mas axis is nowadays considered to be a main mechanism, which counterbalances the vasoconstrictive actions of classical RAS, which includes renin, ACE, ANG II, and its receptors AT1 and AT2. Whereas the classical RAS has been known for more than 100 years, the protective arm of the RAS was relatively recently discovered. Both Mas and Ang-(1-7) were first described almost 30 years ago; however, it took an additional 15 years until the interaction of these components was revealed. Here, we will describe the story of Mas and Ang-(1-7), which was full of errors and uncertainty at the beginning, until the interrelationship between the two was unveiled in 2003.",1
"The aim of this chapter is to describe the animal models generated by transgenic technology for the functional analysis of the protective axis of the renin–angiotensin system, consisting of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7), and Mas. Transgenic overexpression of the components of this axis in general led to an ameliorated cardiac and vascular damage in disease states and to an improved metabolic profile. Knockout models for ACE2 and Mas, however, show aggravated cardiovascular pathologies and a metabolic syndrome-like state. In particular, the local production of Ang-(1-7) in the vascular wall, in the heart, and in the brain was found to be of high physiological relevance by the use of transgenic animals overexpressing ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) in these tissues.",1
"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), discovered as a homologue of ACE, acts as its physiological counterbalance providing homeostatic regulation of circulating angiotensin II (Ang II) levels. ACE2 is a zinc metalloenzyme and carboxypeptidase located as an ectoenzyme on the surface of endothelial and other cells. While its primary substrate appears to be Ang II, it can hydrolyze a number of other physiological substrates. Additionally, ACE2 functions in other noncatalytic cellular roles including the regulation of intestinal neutral amino acid transport. It also serendipitously acts as the receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus. Upregulation of ACE2 expression and function is increasingly recognized as a potential therapeutic strategy in hypertension and cardiovascular disease, diabetes, lung injury, and fibrotic disorders. ACE2 is regulated at multiple levels including transcriptional, posttranscriptional (miRNA and epigenetic), and posttranslational through its shedding from the cell surface.",1
"Experimental and clinical evidence supports an active role of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS) in the pathogenesis and progression of lung diseases. Angiotensin II (Ang II), a key vasoactive peptide of the RAS, has been implicated in pulmonary disorders such as pulmonary arterial hypertension, lung fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Over the past few years, the classical concept of the RAS has undergone substantial changes to include several new active components. Among them, the identification of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), its metabolic product angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)), and the Mas receptor has been of biological significance since these components form a counterregulatory axis (ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas) that opposes the detrimental actions of Ang II. In this chapter, we will discuss the role of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis in lung diseases and describe novel therapeutic approaches to activate this axis for the treatment of pulmonary disorders.",1
Lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly are common findings in children. Both benign and malignant processes can produce these findings and it is important to distinguish between the two so that appropriate management can be undertaken.,1
This chapter provides an investor framework for analyzing hedge fund governance. It discusses the relationship between the increased focus on operational due diligence and governance. The efforts of institutional investors such as the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (“CalPERS”) in promoting governance analysis are discussed. This chapter also outlines techniques for performing due diligence on fund directors including interview techniques and background investigations. Other topics covered in this chapter include the relationship of separately managed accounts with investor governance analysis and governance considerations for investor financial statement analysis.,1
"Chapter Summaries There are many known hazards, including natural, man-made, and intentional. The source of risk is the wide range of hazards that are faced in almost every facet of life. The global society must contend with an array of hazards that may seem limitless, but which is actually limited owing to an individual’s genetics, spatial movements, habits, activities, and geographic locations. Physical location is the primary factor dictating what natural hazards a nation faces. Economic, industrial, and sociopolitical factors dictate hazards of technological and intentional origin. Moreover, with globalization, the speed and ease of international travel, and the emergence of global climate change patterns, every nation is connected to every other nation on the planet. This chapter begins with a short description of the disaster management processes of hazard identification and hazard analysis. Following this is a listing and descriptions of many of the hazards that possess catastrophic potential—in other words, those hazards that are capable of causing a disaster. Awareness of the hazards that affect a nation or region and full understanding of the causes and consequences of that hazard “portfolio” are the first steps in the disaster reduction process known as disaster risk management.",1
"Chapter Summaries Multilateral organizations are composed of sovereign governments. They may be regional, organized around a common issue or function, or global. International financial institutions (IFIs) are international banks composed of sovereign member states that use public money from the Member States to provide technical and financial support for developing countries. The United Nations is the organization most involved in the mitigation of, preparedness for, response to, and recovery from disasters around the world. It is considered the best equipped to do so because of its strong relationships with most countries, especially the developing countries where assistance is most needed. When disasters strike, the UN is one of the first organizations to mobilize, and it remains in the affected countries during the recovery period for many years after. The Consolidated Appeal Process is one way the UN garners international support for relief and reconstruction. In many regions, governments have formed smaller international organizations, many of which address risk, as well. The IFIs provide nations with low capital reserves funding in the aftermath of disasters recovery reconstruction. The World Bank is regarded as one of the largest sources of development assistance.",1

"Molecular analysis of respiratory viruses and the host response to both infection and vaccination have transformed our understanding of these ubiquitous pathogens. Polymerase chain reaction for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral infections has led to a better understanding of the epidemiology and impact of many common respiratory viruses and resulted in better patient care. Over the past decade a number of new respiratory viruses including human metapneumovirus and new coronaviruses have been discovered using molecular techniques such as random primer amplification, pan-viral array and next generation sequencing. Analysis of the host transcriptional response during respiratory viral infection using in-vitro, animal models and natural and experimental human challenge have furthered the understanding of the mechanisms and predictors of severe disease and may identify potential therapeutic targets to prevent and ameliorate illness.",1
"The emergence of viral infections is driven by multiple factors including changes in human behavior, population growth, reservoir host distribution, viral diversity and environmental changes. Effective surveillance methods, diagnostic assays and containment measures are pivotal to preventing widespread outbreak of a new viral infection. However, the limited understanding of some emerging viruses poses numerous challenges for effective intervention. In this chapter we discuss various genomics-based methods and strategies to overcome these inherent challenges of emerging and re-emerging viral infections with a focus on current viral threats. We also provide an outlook on the use of genomic tools in personalized medicine and potential solutions to current and foreseeable challenges.",1
"With the advances in computational resources, there is an increasing urge among the computational researchers to make the in silico approaches fast, convenient, reproducible, acceptable, and sensible ones. Along with the typical two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) methods, approaches like pharmacophore, structure-based docking studies, and combinations of ligand- and structure-based approaches like comparative residue interaction analysis (CoRIA) and comparative binding energy analysis (COMBINE) have gained a significant popularity in the computational drug design process. A pharmacophore can be developed either in a ligand-based method, by superposing a set of active molecules and extracting common chemical features which are vital for their bioactivity; or in a structure-based manner, by probing probable interaction points between the macromolecular target and ligands. The interaction of protein and ligand molecules with each other is one of the interesting studies in modern molecular biology and molecular recognition. This interaction can well be explained with the conceptof a docking study to show how a molecule can bind to another molecule to exert the bioactivity. Docking and pharmacophore are non-QSAR approaches in in silico drug design that can support the QSAR findings. Approaches like CoRIA and COMBINE can use information generated from the ligand–receptor complexes to extract the critical clue concerning the types of significant interaction at the level of both the receptor and the ligand. Employing the abovementioned ligand- and structure-based methodologies and chemical libraries, virtual screening (VS) emerged as an important tool in the quest to develop novel drug compounds. VS serves as an efficient computational tool that integrates structural data with lead optimization as a cost-effective approach to drug discovery.",1
"Members of the family Coronaviridae are evolutionarily related and play an important role in human and veterinary medicine. Taxonomic classification is based on the ultrastructure and morphogenesis of viral particles and on biochemical and molecular features. The family Coronaviridae belongs to the order Nidovirales, and is divided into two subfamilies: Coronavirinae and Torovirinae. The number of coronaviruses isolated from aquatic organisms is negligible; indeed, coronaviruses have only been identified in aquatic mammals, including harbor seal (genus Alphacoronavirus), bottlenose dolphin and beluga whale (genus Gammacoronavirus). White bream virus, isolated from the teleost Blicca bjoerkna (L.), is the type species of the genus Bafinivirus within the subfamily, Torovirinae.",1
"Viruses with diverse virion architectures demarcated into four families in the order Nidovirales have been discovered in vertebrate mammalian and fish species, as well as in invertebrate crustacean and mosquito species. The order is unified by nidoviruses sharing intermediate (12.7kb) to very long (31.7kb) (+) ssRNA genomes, each possessing a long 5′-terminal gene encoding overlapping ORF1a and ORF1b reading frames that contain a diversity of functionally related enzymes and that are translated in toto using a −1 ribosomal frameshift mechanism, as well as by semiconserved strategies for transcribing a nested set of 3′-coterminal subgenomic mRNAs that translate the viral proteins. The nidovirus that is most important to an aquaculture species is yellow head virus (YHV), which causes disease in shrimp farmed throughout the Eastern Hemisphere and is classified in the genus Okavirus, family Roniviridae. Fathead minnow nidovirus, genus Bafinivirus, subfamily Torovirinae, family Coronaviridae, also causes disease in minnows grown for the baitfish industry in the United States. Virions similar in morphology to okaviruses and bafiniviruses have also been detected in several crab species. Of these, however, only Eriocheir sinensis ronivirus, which causes disease in the Chinese mitten crab, an important freshwater aquaculture species in China, has been shown to possess a ~22kb ssRNA genome that supports its being a nidovirus, but its taxonomic classification awaits genome sequence analysis. This chapter provides an overview of the structure, replication and biology of these viruses with a particular focus on YHV disease characteristics, diagnostic methods and disease prevention strategies.",1

"The popularity and commercialization of the “Internetwork” began in the late 1990s through the interconnection of computer networks using special gateways or routers to transfer packets of electronic data. As with many things in life, Internetwork technology has had both positive and negative effects on society, and Asia has been no exception. One of the negative effects has been a surge in Internet crime. According to a report released by the Gartner Consulting Group, in 2013 smart phone sales exceeded regular phone sales for the first time, with 968 million smart phones sold, representing 54% of the global mobile phone total and an increase of 54% from 2012. The popularity and technology of the mobile Internetwork, especially the smart mobile phone web, has changed the Internetwork landscape through the concept of cloud computing. Cloud computing is distributed computing over a network, using a program or application that can run on many connected computers and in different locations around the globe simultaneously at a reduced cost. This distributed cloud computing presents law enforcement authorities with the unique challenge of policing Internet crime. Cloud computing relies on sharing resources to achieve coherence, and in doing so creates economies of scale for converged infrastructures and shared services. Accordingly, one problem facing the authorities is the presence of trans- and multijurisdictional crimes. In this chapter, I explore this topic in the contexts of Hong Kong and Singapore, as both are key players on the international stage, especially in relation to international finance and information technology. In both locations, infrastructure works to maintain global financial center status. The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows. A brief overview of the development of cloud computing is followed by an examination of cybercrime risks in the cloud. Then, I review how the authorities in Hong Kong and Singapore respond to cybercrime risks and explore the current government policies on cloud computing, particularly in fighting cybercrime.",1
"In this chapter, we describe 73 zoonotic viruses that were isolated in Northern Eurasia and that belong to the different families of viruses with a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome. The family includes viruses with a segmented negative-sense ssRNA genome (families Bunyaviridae and Orthomyxoviridae) and viruses with a positive-sense ssRNA genome (families Togaviridae and Flaviviridae). Among them are viruses associated with sporadic cases or outbreaks of human disease, such as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (viruses of the genus Hantavirus), Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHFV, Nairovirus), California encephalitis (INKV, TAHV, and KHATV; Orthobunyavirus), sandfly fever (SFCV and SFNV, Phlebovirus), Tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV, Flavivirus), Omsk hemorrhagic fever (OHFV, Flavivirus), West Nile fever (WNV, Flavivirus), Sindbis fever (SINV, Alphavirus) Chikungunya fever (CHIKV, Alphavirus) and others. Other viruses described in the chapter can cause epizootics in wild or domestic animals: Geta virus (GETV, Alphavirus), Influenza A virus (Influenzavirus A), Bhanja virus (BHAV, Phlebovirus) and more. The chapter also discusses both ecological peculiarities that promote the circulation of these viruses in natural foci and factors influencing the occurrence of epidemic and epizootic outbreaks",1

"Concept of “risk analysis” in food safety management needs to be understood to assess, manage, and communicate risks for proper implementation of food safety policies, food laws, and standards, in a country. Science-based approaches, which are an integral part of risk analysis to improve modern food safety systems, are intimately linked to processes such as good quality practices. Risk analysis strengthens the ability of traditional food safety systems to meet current challenges. Risk analysis is just one part of an effective food safety system. Other components of food safety system like food safety policies, food legislation, food inspection, laboratory analysis, epidemiological surveillance of food-borne diseases, monitoring systems for chemical and microbiological contamination in foods, and information, education and communication, also need to be improved continuously. “Food safety controls” are now being replaced by “risk-based controls” in all stages of food production.",1

"The one-drug/one-target/one-disease approach to drug discovery is presently facing many challenges of safety, efficacy, and sustainability. Network biology and polypharmacology approaches gained appreciation recently as methods for omics data integration and multitarget drug development, respectively. The combination of these two approaches created a novel paradigm called network pharmacology (NP) that looks at the effect of drugs on both the interactome and the diseasome level. Ayurveda, the traditional system of Indian medicine, uses intelligent formulations containing multiple ingredients and multiple bioactive compounds; however, the scientific rationale and mechanisms remain largely unexplored. NP approaches can serve as a valuable tool for evidence-based Ayurveda to understand the medicines’ putative actions, indications, and mechanisms. This chapter discusses NP and its potential to explore traditional medicine systems to overcome the drug discovery impasse.",1
"In light of terrorist events in the United States and in recognition of the potential for diversion of highly pathogenic organisms for illicit purposes, the US Congress has in the past 15 years enacted a series of laws designed to enhance laboratory biosecurity. The Office of the President has also issued orders intended to implement and augment these new statutes imposing additional procedural and technical requirements on laboratories working with Select Agents and Toxins. Researchers and laboratory managers can substantially influence the implementation of new mandates with a thorough understanding of the regulatory process, reviewed in this chapter from a historical perspective with an emphasis on the practical aspects of rule-making procedures carried out by the Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services.",1
"This chapter will give a thorough overview of the laws and guidelines regulating research use of biological materials in the United States and how Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBC) came to be tasked with providing oversight for these activities. The anthrax attacks after 9/11 demonstrated that information gained from life science research can be used to threaten national security and public health. Since these attacks, the public has demanded increased oversight of research. IBC oversight falls under the National Institutes of Health Guidelines. Over the years, other federal agencies have increased the demands on the IBC by promulgating new legislation and regulations. The following agencies play a role in regulating research: National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity, National Research Council, National Institutes of Health, Food and Drug Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Human and Health Services, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and Department of Justice.",1
"In the United States, several regulations and federal policies govern the use of potentially biohazardous materials in research and industry. Part of this oversight is assigned by mandate to Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBCs). However, most research entities give additional responsibilities to their IBC to take advantage of a standing body with significant expertise in review and oversight of biohazardous research. Two case studies are provided to highlight functions of the IBC which are not mandated, yet are critical for safe and responsible research. There are also types of biohazardous work that are currently unregulated and receive no review from an IBC or other group of subject matter experts, leaving a gap in safety oversight. To mitigate the hazard of working with potentially hazardous unregulated biological material, the necessity of performing a risk assessment and of performing a hazard review by subject matter experts, such as those on an IBC, is of paramount importance.",1
"Many Institutional Biosafety Committees have expanded their role beyond their original mission, described in the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules. The guidelines are derived from the 1975 Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA Molecules that convened to examine and address societal concerns surrounding the (then) newly emerging recombinant DNA technology. This chapter will focus on emerging biological agents and cutting-edge technologies that present challenges to evaluating and assessing the biohazard risks associated with research protocols. Highly specialized and/or cross-disciplinary knowledge may be required for committee members to be able to evaluate benefit versus risk for research proposals addressing emerging infectious agents or technologies. The importance of designing a process that will account for the full range of requirements to fulfill the societal expectations of safety, efficiency, and scientific progress is highlighted.",1
"Aside from playing a vital part in overseeing the use of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acids used in vitro, in vivo, in utero, or ex vivo, Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBCs) oversee multiple aspects of research ranging from: performing risk assessments and mitigation, including assignment of biosafety levels and practices, NIH category designations related to the particular experiments per the NIH guidelines for research involving synthetic or nucleic acid molecules, agency reporting and approval of standard operation procedures used for animal research. Animal models are a core component of biological research and play a critical role in numerous aspects of studying human disease, including through the creation of transgenic animals, but they can also be used to research diseases that naturally occur within animal populations. They also present disadvantages and unique biosafety issues.",1
"Stringent, exacting and local oversight for the control and use of Select Agents and Toxins is crucial to ensuring biosecurity. However, review of research involving Select Agents and Toxins can present particular challenges to the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC). Institutional review for biosecurity programs focuses on security assessments and access control, whereas most IBCs primarily focus on occupational exposure assessment, biohazard control, and biosafety practices. Determining how and where to interweave biosecurity program requirements into programs based on occupational health priorities is the key to integrated and effective compliance management. Recent new or pending regulations on dual use or gain of function research suggests or mandates additional duties for the IBC. This chapter explores challenges and strategies for institutional oversight and support of Select Agent program compliance.",1
"For four decades the NIH Guidelines have served as the framework for the oversight of research with recombinant and synthetic nucleic acid molecules. IBCs are a vital component in that system of oversight as the entity that ensures the safe conduct of this type of research at the local level. IBC review also provides a public window into the procedures utilized by institutions to manage biohazards, thereby protecting human health, animal health, and the environment. It is both because of their biosafety responsibilities, as well as the manner in which they offer transparency to the public, that IBCs play a central role in fostering public trust in the safety of the life science research enterprise.",1
"The US government (USG) has not fully implemented a robust system to evaluate dual-use research (DUR). In particular, the USG has failed to effectively fund, support, and expand the role of the local Institutional Biosafety Committee in the oversight of DUR and in the changing scientific landscape; a comprehensive education program for all in life sciences research with regard to the dual-use dilemma has not been forthcoming; and finally, there has been no systematic evaluation of the impact of USG policy, regulations, and guidance on an institution’s cost structure and on scientific discovery. We detail our judgments on current USG DUR policy and provide recommendations for future oversight of DUR from our perspective as senior administrators and laboratory scientists charged with the responsibility of conducting life-sciences research in an era of increasing regulatory requirements and decreasing federal support.",1

"In multiple sclerosis (MS), environmental factors and genetic traits cooperate in the induction of the chronic activation of immune cells to produce the brain pathology. Epidemiology has focused on different environmental risk factors but certainly virus infection, smoking, vitamin D levels, and sunlight exposure are the most relevant. What is certainly less clear is the way in which these external factors are able to induce and sustain the internal pathology process of the disease. Epigenetics has been recently focused on trying to shed light on this aspect. As a matter of fact epigenetic changes are highly sensitive to environmental factors that therefore may influence the susceptibility to the disease by acting through epigenetic modifications. In this chapter we discuss the most relevant environmental factors and how they may affect the immune response in MS. Finally, we discuss the possible role of the microbiota in inducing autoimmunity in MS.",1

"This chapter deals with small molecule modulators of the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS). They are designed to restore its impaired capacity to dispose of soluble, dysfunctional protein copies, and to fight its pathological impairment in proteinopathies in general and in tauopathies in particular. Two specific molecular targets belonging to the U-box E3 ligase family (C-terminus of Hsc70 interacting protein, CHIP) and to the proteasome-associated cysteine protease DUB family (USP14) are selected for their putative role against NDDs and tauopathies. The limited available structural information for the two targets, and for their interactions with members of UPS-driven protein complexes, is described. A small number of known modulators for each target (or even for structurally related targets, possibly to provide translatable examples) are portrayed in terms of their biological profile, and of their development potential as disease-modifying drugs against NDDs.",1

"This chapter describes the range and diversity of virus genomes. Structural and chemical diversity, ranging from small, single-stranded RNA genomes of a few kilobases up to large and complex double-stranded DNA genomes bigger than those of simple cells, is unique to viruses and not mirrored in cellular organisms. RNA genomes may be affected by genetic mechanisms distinct from those which operate in cells and this is reflected in the replication and biology of viruses in ways which are discussed in subsequent chapters. By considering representative examples of different types of virus genome we can understand the range of genetic diversity seen in viruses.",1
"This chapter provides an overview of the key stages in virus replication, including the historic experiments which resulted in our present understanding. It describes, step by step, how replication unfolds, starting with the initial interaction between the virus and a host cell and finishing with the release of infectious virus particles which can go on and infect new cells. Since these processes are essential in the replication cycle, understanding how they can be blocked specifically without damaging the host cell is the key to understanding how antiviral drugs work.",1
"Pathogenicity is the capacity of an organism to cause disease. During virus infections, diseases symptoms arise from two causes, direct injury caused by virus replication and the side effects of the immune response to infection. The balance between these two is variable. The majority of virus infections are asymptomatic and do not cause disease. Only a tiny number of infections cause serious or life-threatening consequences such as immunodeficiency, or tumors. Diseases caused by previously unknown viruses continue to be regularly identified. Occasionally, known viruses appear to change their behavior, suddenly causing outbreaks of diseases. Such viruses are known as emerging viruses and frequently the cause of a new disease is when a virus switches host species and begins to infect another, and changes in human activities also result in the emergence of new or previously unrecognized diseases.",1

Factors contributing to the emergence of diseases include increasing international travel and commerce, changes in human demographics and behavior, advances in technology and industry, microbial adaptation and the breakdown of public health systems. Of emerging diseases, 60% are zoonotic, making the human–animal biome interaction critical. Preparedness for an emerging disease relies on strong biosurveillance systems for early detection. Control measures to prevent transmission must be implemented early. These include: rapid epidemiologic surveillance and investigations to characterize the disease; transmission prevention through containment and control measures; development and deployment of medical countermeasures; and emergency public information and warning. Recovery after the outbreak of an emerging disease can result in a “new normal” with persistent endemic infection in the community.",1
"This chapter will describe pandemic threats and the steps necessary to reduce morbidity and mortality. An explanation is provided on genetic mutations leading to the emergence of novel influenza strains. Medical countermeasures include vaccination and antiviral medications. Public messaging is also important to promote flu shots, reinforce basic hygiene measures, and instruct those who may be ill to limit contacts. The World Health Organization (WHO) tracks seasonal influenza for anomalies indicating an emerging pandemic influenza strain. WHO updated the international pandemic alert system after the 2009–2010 H1N1 pandemic. With each declaration, temporary recommendations are provided, and added regulatory actions are taken by WHO member states. In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated the U.S. framework for pandemic influenza preparedness and response. Each pandemic interval is accompanied by specific recommendations for state and local public health authorities. Effective influenza control includes both pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical recommendations. Other severe viral pandemic respiratory threats, including the “Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus” (MERS-CoV), require similar resources and infrastructure to manage.",1
"This chapter provides the reader with an understanding and appreciation for the scope and importance of biological threats and the opportunity to see where they may be and have become the desire of terrorist groups and the makings of weapons of mass destruction. The history of biological warfare is covered in depth. These major events are important in helping us understand the issues related to using biological substances against an adversary. The difference between biosecurity and biodefense are explained and then related to homeland security and homeland defense, respectively. This chapter also details how expensive these programs are, with nearly $80billion having been spent on civilian biodefense since fiscal year 2001 in the United States alone. As discussed herein, there is a significant difference in the reality and the potential of bioterrorism. Bioterrorism on a large scale is a low-probability event. Bioterrorism on a small scale is a fairly routine occurrence with little potential. Biological threats remain very much in the news. Recent examples, such as laboratory incidents, the Ebola outbreak of 2014, and other emerging threats, are covered in this chapter.",1
"This chapter covers Category C diseases and agents. These emerging diseases present a very unique challenge to public health officials and infectious disease specialists. Perhaps they have been with us for millions of years, lurking in a dark corner of the environment, waiting for an opportunity to jump from their natural cycle of transmission to a human host. Or they may represent something totally new. Regardless of their origin, an emerging disease pathogen must be characterized quickly by molecular biologists and microbiologists. The dynamics of disease transmission must be investigated by teams of epidemiologists. Treatment regimens must be formulated by clinicians working on the frontlines of the outbreak. Disease prevention strategies and risk communications must be quickly formulated by public health officials. Finally, media attention for emerging disease outbreaks forces government officials at all levels to address the problem with planning and preparedness activities aimed at preserving the health of the public. Specific examples explored in this chapter include Nipah virus, hantavirus, West Nile fever virus, and the coronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome.",1
"Chapter 7 presents six case studies that should provoke the reader to delve more into the particulars of each incident. Specifically, the chapter provides details on the Sverdlovsk anthrax incident (1979); the Rajneeshee Salmonella incident (1984); the Surat, India pneumonic plague outbreak (1994); the Fallen Angel ricin incidents (2003–04); Amerithrax (2001); and the outbreak of Ebola virus in West Africa (2014–15). Each of these incidents help illustrate the difference between an unusual natural outbreak and one due to an intentional act. In addition, each case study presented herein shows how confounding these outbreaks can be to public health officials and how fear, panic, and social disruption may ensue.",1
"Chapter 10 covers the administrative and legal aspects of biosecurity, which include international treaties, laws, statutes, regulations, and government directives aimed at reducing the threat due to the biological agents and enabling enforcers to deal with those that use them with ill intentions. These administrative measures have helped define programs and strengthen biodefense and biosecurity all over the globe. The aim of this chapter is to discuss the most relevant documents in hopes that the reader will appreciate the authority and framework given to officials by these measures. The chapter is not written for legal professionals. Rather, it is written for emergency management and public health professionals that may have to apply the rules of law in everyday situations. Care should be taken to consult a legal professional before utilizing any of the concepts related to public health law.",1
"Chapter 11 covers the convergence of agencies from all levels of government to the scene of a biological event. In fact, many agencies from the federal level will respond to a chemical, biological, radiological/nuclear, and explosive incident, providing necessary resources. Planners within local jurisdictions need to maintain a list of the agencies, the contact numbers, and the resources available from each. State and local governments must be fully compliant with the National Incident Management System, which includes the adaptation of the Incident Command System. Unified or area command is an essential element in domestic incident management in which multiple jurisdictions and agencies are involved. It provides guidelines to enable agencies with different legal, geographic, and functional responsibilities to effectively coordinate, plan, and interact. Unified or area command removes much of the inefficiency and duplication of effort that can occur when agencies from different functional and geographic jurisdictions or agencies at different levels of government operate without a common system or organizational framework.",1
"Chapter 12 explores the programs and assets that have been assembled internationally, nationally, and regionally to safeguard populations from the threat of biological agents. The programs and assets can be viewed with the framework of comprehensive emergency management, which is made up of mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. Nations have come together and taken a stance individually to mitigate the threat. For the most part, these programs produce policy and procedures that support the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention of 1972. Responding to a biological disaster will be frustrating, confusing, and dangerous for first responders, first receivers, and public health officials. Developed countries are far better trained and equipped to deal with the release of a formulated biological agent than they were 15years ago. Specific examples of programs and assets that match up with mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery are discussed herein.",1
"This chapter discusses the likely future of bioweapons development and the research that is needed to counter them. Methods for creating customized pathogens that can evade an immune system or work around a conventional antibiotic are discussed. In addition, emerging trends in synthetic biology are discussed. Biological warfare and bioterrorism are multifaceted problems requiring multifaceted solutions. Fortunately, the same advances in genomic biotechnologies that can be used to create bioweapons can also be used to set up countermeasures against them. We currently have in place sophisticated and well-developed biosecurity and biodefense programs. These programs are essential to countering the asymmetric warfare threat, but they are costly and perishable. Future directions in biosecurity and biodefense may very well be determined by the “next event.” However, the most likely events are those that naturally and accidentally threaten human and animal health through the emergence of novel pathogens and the reemergence of others in light of new environmental or societal factors.",1

"The marine environment provides an array of compounds often with unique molecular architectures boasting an equally wide array of bioactivities including anticancer, antiinflammatory, and antimicrobial activity. Typically without the benefit of folklore therapeutic knowledge, marine organisms are collected, extracted, and fractionated to afford compounds that undergo evaluation with in vivo and in vitro assays en route to clinical applications. The pharmaceutical industry has benefited from research into marine metabolites with the development of marine-derived drugs including cytarabine, vidarabine, and ziconotide along with the more recently developed formulation Carragelose, an antiviral spray. Cosmetic applications incorporating marine extracts include Abyssine and RefirMAR. Research with macroinvertebrates, macroalgae, and microorganisms continue in the hope that drugs of the future will be culled from the oceans of the world. While obtaining a consistent and adequate supply of the bioactive compounds remains a challenge to be overcome, synthetic methods are being employed along with the application of biotechnological techniques to ensure that the drugs, when developed, will be in sufficient quantities for distribution to those who are in need.",1
"This chapter provides an introduction to animals that are commonly used for research. It presents information on basic care topics such as biology, behavior, housing, feeding, sexing, and breeding of these animals. The chapter provides some insight into the reasons why these animals are used in research. It also gives an overview of techniques that can be utilized to collect blood or to administer drugs or medicine. Each section concludes with a brief description of how to recognize abnormal signs, in addition to lists of various diseases.",1
"Zinc deficiency in humans was recognized for the first time in 1963, and a recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for zinc was established by the US National Academy of Sciences in 1974. The present World Health Organization (WHO) estimate is that nearly 2billion subjects living in the developing world may have zinc deficiency. This is mainly because they subsist on cereal proteins which contain high quantities of organic phosphate compounds, which combine with zinc making it unavailable for absorption. The major adverse clinical effects of zinc deficiency are growth retardation, decreased cell-mediated immunity, impairment of cognitive functions, increased oxidative stress, and upregulation of inflammatory cytokines. Our studies have shown that nearly 30% of healthy, well-to-do elderly subjects living in developed countries may also be zinc deficient due to an increased phytate to zinc molar ratio in their diet. Over 300 enzymes and 2000 transcription factors are now known to require zinc for their functions and stability of their structures, and several studies have now shown that zinc may be a molecular signal for neuronal and immune cells. Fourteen ZIP and 10 ZNT zinc transporters are known to maintain intracellular zinc homeostasis. Therapeutic impacts of zinc on human health are also being investigated. Zinc is being used for the treatment of acute diarrhea in infants and children in developing countries globally, and this has resulted in saving millions of lives. Zinc is now an approved drug for the treatment and maintenance therapy of Wilson's disease, a serious fatal genetic disorder. According to a recent Cochrane Review, zinc is the only treatment which is effective in decreasing the incidence of infections and pain crises in patients with sickle cell disease. Zinc acetate lozenges have been shown to decrease the duration of the common cold by 50%, provided the treatment is started within 24h of the onset of symptoms, the solution chemistry of the zinc preparation is proper, and the zinc dosages are adequate. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) accounts for a large proportion of legal blindness in elderly subjects throughout the world. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study Group (AREDS) was supported by National Eye Institute. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has now reported the results of their 10-year zinc supplementation study in patients with AMD. Zinc was effective in decreasing the incidences of blindness and progression of AMD in elderly subjects. Most importantly, zinc-supplemented subjects showed increased longevity and this was due to a decrease in cardiovascular events. No other micronutrient has shown this dramatic effect on decreasing mortality in the elderly. Our placebo-controlled, zinc supplementation trial in the elderly has shown that zinc supplementation decreased the incidence of infections by 66% and improved cell-mediated immunity. Also, we showed that oxidative stress markers and gene expression of inflammatory cytokines were decreased in elderly subjects who received zinc supplementation. These studies suggest that zinc supplementation in the elderly may have a preventive role in atherosclerosis. Plasma zinc is widely used as a biomarker of zinc deficiency in humans. This test is, however, neither specific nor sensitive. Assays of immunological markers such as plasma active thymulin and gene expression of IL-2 in PHA-stimulated lymphocytes are very sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of human zinc deficiency. The assay of zinc in cells such as lymphocytes and granulocytes are better than plasma zinc; however, even these assays are less sensitive than immunological biomarkers.",1
"Vaccination is the most effective means of preventing and controlling viral infections. The eradication of smallpox and the significant progress made toward polio eradication are clear examples of the great impact of antiviral vaccines. However, viral infections remain a major public health threat and a significant cause of death. Most of the antiviral vaccines introduced over the past century were empirically developed. Poliomyelitis, measles, mumps, and rubella are examples of diseases that are now largely controlled thanks to these empirically developed vaccines. However, there is a growing list of viral pathogens against which effective vaccines are yet to be developed. Recent technological advances will potentially provide us with new platforms that could be harnessed to develop vaccines against emerging and reemerging viral pathogens.",1
"Infectious diseases continue to plague mankind and evolve to keep pace with the efforts to control them. Sir William Osler captured the ongoing fear of infectious pathogens when he said, “Humanity has but three great enemies: fever, famine, and war; of these by far the greatest, by far the most terrible, is fever.” Despite the significant impact of antimicrobials and vaccines on public health, there has only been one major human pathogen eradicated—variola virus, the agent of smallpox. In its place have been a series of new and reemerging microbes responsible for isolated infections, regional outbreaks, and global pandemics. Bacterial, fungal, and parasitic pathogens have the capacity to cause widespread epidemics such as the “Black Death” caused by Yersinia pestis in 14th century Europe. However, bacteria, fungi, and parasites are less likely to cause widespread human pandemics at this point in history and are less amenable to vaccine strategies than viral diseases. Focusing on viruses, a catalog of newly discovered human pathogens from the beginning of the 20th century shows a predictable and nearly linear rate of new agents discovered over time. However, of the more than 100 virus families, only 22 have been associated with human infections, a number that seems to have plateaued. In the chapter we will concentrate on vaccines for emerging viral diseases.",1

"During pathogenesis, viruses come in contact with the microbiota that colonizes the mucosal sites they infect. The intestinal microbiota has emerged as a critical factor in intestinal viral susceptibility. While the interaction of virus-intestinal commensal bacteria can lead to enhanced or decreased viral infection capacity, several scientific studies support the use of probiotics as antiviral therapies. Thus, probiotics and the modulation of the intestinal microbiota are envisaged as therapeutic strategies in the prevention and treatment of viral infection.",1
"Although a wide range of diseases have been reported in captive snow leopards, little is known about those affecting the species in the wild. However, the potential threat from diseases to wild snow leopards must not be underestimated as a consequence of lack of health surveillance throughout the inaccessible terrains they occupy. As a felid, the snow leopard is likely to be susceptible to most infectious agents affecting the domestic cat, and here we provide an overview of those with a risk of lethality for free-ranging snow leopards. In contrast to the health of snow leopards themselves, a great deal is known about the diseases affecting their primary prey species. We present these cases and highlight the importance of livestock as the main source of disease spillover to natural prey species. Further studies are required to understand the impact of infectious agents on intra- and interspecific population dynamics of snow leopards and associated prey.",1
"Vaccines are considered primary tools for health intervention in both humans and animals. Vaccines can be used more widely, especially in developing countries, if their cost of production can be reduced and they can be preserved without refrigeration. In developing countries certain limitations, like vaccine affordability, the need for “cold chains” from the producer to the site of use of the vaccine, and the dependence on injection, are barriers to health care services. Plant-derived vaccines do not face such limitations. Research under way is dedicated to solving these limitations by finding ways to produce oral (edible) vaccines from transgenic plants. Plant-derived vaccines offer increased safety, envisage low-cost programs for mass vaccination, and propose a wider use of vaccination for veterinary use.",1
"This chapter describes the basic biology of oral microbes, including cytological basis of the microorganisms, microbial morphology, microbial cell structure, microbial physiology, and microbial genetics.",1
"Noroviruses constitute a major genus in the family Caliciviridae, which contains icosahedral viruses with positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome. In humans, these constantly evolving viruses are the cause of sporadic and epidemic gastroenteritis. Despite a lack of a reproducible cell culture system or a small animal model, remarkable progress has been made in our understanding of the molecular biology, immunology, structural biology, and evolution of human noroviruses. This understanding is further enhanced by studies of nonhuman noroviruses and animal caliciviruses that are cultivatable. The main focus of this chapter is to review our current understanding of the structural biology of noroviruses in particular and of caliciviruses in general, with an emphasis on the unique modular organization of the capsid that allows for strain-dependent variations in glycan recognition and antigenicity to facilitate sustained virus evolution. Finally, structures of the proteins are reviewed that are critical for virus replication and that can be targeted in the design of small molecule drugs for use as effective antivirals.",1
"Atomic-level structural information and advances in synthetic biology and nanotechnology have created new opportunities for generating vaccines in a way that has not been possible using traditional methods. These novel approaches to recombinant vaccine design are opening doors to the development of vaccines against challenging targets. In this chapter, we discuss the exceptional humoral immunogenicity of virus-like particles (VLPs) and related nanoparticles and their application to vaccine development. The emergence of this new category of vaccine platforms is based on recent insights from multiple fields of study, including immunology, virology, nanotechnology, structural biology, synthetic biology, and bioengineering. The multidisciplinary work on VLP and nanoparticle immunogens is already yielding dividends for public health, but is also likely to result in safer, more potent and broadly protective vaccines against a wide variety of human and animal pathogens, as well as target host proteins of interest.",1
"Congruent to a rapidly growing population is the generation of horticultural and agricultural by-products and waste. The modern-day food cycle includes agricultural production, postharvest handling and storage, food processing and packaging, and distribution and retail, ending with consumption and waste disposal. Of these, agricultural production and postharvest handling and storage result in unintended losses and by-products whereas the other steps generally result in food waste. Approximately one-third of the worldwide food production is wasted each year. Although it is most desirable to prevent waste and by-product formation, followed by reuse or recycling, the formation of by-products and waste is inevitable, and management options must be innovative and also meet legislative requirements. However, management options are mostly a compromise between what is viewed acceptable based on legal requirements and local perceptions, and what is deemed technologically and financially feasible.",1
"Inflammatory demyelinating diseases are a heterogeneous group of disorders, which occur against the background of an acute or chronic inflammatory process. The pathologic hallmark of multiple sclerosis (MS) is the presence of focal demyelinated lesions with partial axonal preservation and reactive astrogliosis. Demyelinated plaques are present in the white as well as gray matter, such as the cerebral or cerebellar cortex and brainstem nuclei. Activity of the disease process is reflected by the presence of lesions with ongoing myelin destruction. Axonal and neuronal destruction in the lesions is a major substrate for permanent neurologic deficit in MS patients. The MS pathology is qualitatively similar in different disease stages, such as relapsing remitting MS or secondary or primary progressive MS, but the prevalence of different lesion types differs quantitatively. Acute MS and Balo's type of concentric sclerosis appear to be variants of classic MS. In contrast, neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and spectrum disorders (NMOSD) are inflammatory diseases with primary injury of astrocytes, mediated by aquaporin-4 antibodies. Finally, we discuss the histopathology of other inflammatory demyelinating diseases such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated demyelination. Knowledge of the heterogenous immunopathology in demyelinating diseases is important, to understand the clinical presentation and disease course and to find the optimal treatment for an individual patient.",1

"Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) is the predominant cause of the food-borne salmonellosis in humans, in part because this serotype has the unique ability to contaminate chicken eggs without causing discernible illness in the infected birds. Attempts to develop effective vaccines and eradicate SE from chickens are undermined by significant limitations in our current understanding of the genetic basis of pathogenesis of SE in this reservoir host. In this chapter, we summarize the infection kinetics and provide an overview of the current understanding of genetic factors underlying SE infection in the chicken host. We also discuss the important knowledge gaps that, if addressed, will improve our understanding of the complex biology of SE in young chickens and in egg laying hens.",1

"Most medical harm is from prescription drugs, surgery, and healthcare-acquired infections. Although the full extent of medical harm remains to be accurately gauged, estimates of incidence have tended to grow larger with each successive detailed assessment. Estimates of the extent of harm in the United States published by the Institutes of Medicine in 2000, which at the time were so shocking as to be disbelieved by some authorities, have since been consistently eclipsed by further detailed analyses. Recent studies show that harm from drugs and infections individually exceeds estimates of what was previously thought to be the total of healthcare-related harm from all causes. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, due primarily to the use, misuse, and overuse of antibiotics, is a particularly ominous threat to future personal and population health.",1

"The tools available for both infectious disease diagnostics and human identity testing have benefitted from major technological advances in the automation of nucleic acid purification, amplification, and detection methods. The seamless integration of these processes into a fully automated microscale format has led to the development of rapid, user-friendly sample-to-answer assay systems. The application of these systems for human identity testing allows for DNA profiles to be generated in a field-forward environment where they can be used to generate investigative leads in crimes or other actionable intelligence. When used for infectious disease diagnostics, the sensitivity and specificity of these assay systems meets or exceeds that of more conventional strategies for the detection of respiratory, gastrointestinal, nervous system, and sexually transmitted pathogens. The anticipated medical benefits of this technology include shorter hospital stays, the elimination of unnecessary or ineffectual treatment, improved patient outcomes, and an overall quantifiable reduction in healthcare costs.",1
"Cell culture is a very versatile tool in the investigation of basic scientific and translation research questions. The advantage of using cell lines in scientific research is their homogeneity and associated reproducibility in data generated. This chapter introduces the principles behind the setup of a cell culture lab and the guidelines that ensure safety of the lab personnel as well as the cultured cells. It also addresses potential microbiological contaminants and how they can be avoided but also detected early. Since the selection of a particular cell line and specific cell culture conditions depends on the readout of the desired assay, this chapter will present a generalized overview of common mammalian cell culture components and properties that contribute to a suitable cell culture microenvironment. Consequently, this chapter outlines several techniques that are crucial for cell propagation and can be easily adapted to a broad number of cell types and experimental procedures.",1
"Viruses are infectious agents that are not cellular in nature. They consist of a nucleic acid genome packaged within a protein shell. Although relatively simple, viruses exhibit significant diversity in terms of size, genome organization, and capsid architecture. All viruses are obligate intracellular parasites as they must obtain energy and building blocks from the cell. They subvert many host cell processes for their own replication, and studying virus replication has provided detailed information about the basic workings of cells. At the cellular level, possible outcomes of infection range from production of virus particles without damage to the cell, to cell death, or occasionally cell transformation. In humans and animals the outcomes of infection range from inapparent (no disease) to considerable disease and death. Some viruses cause acute infections lasting for days or a few weeks while others infect their hosts for a lifetime. Viruses can evolve and rapidly adapt to changing conditions. Some viruses are easily replicated in cultured cells, while others require specific conditions only found in specialized cells within a human or animal. While this text focuses on viruses of humans and other animals, viruses infect organisms of all types, from bacteria to fungi to plants. Viruses are most often classified based on groups of genome and virion characteristics. Genome sequence comparisons provide an unbiased method for grouping and categorizing viruses.",1
"This chapter describes methods for growing, purifying, counting, and characterizing viruses. It also provides general principles of diagnostic virology. As obligate intracellular parasites, viruses require cell in which to replicate. The cells must express appropriate receptors and other proteins required by the virus. Cultured cells are often used to study basic steps in virus replication. Viruses can be purified away from cellular proteins and organelles using centrifugation techniques. Most viruses cannot be seen using standard light microscopes, but are often imaged using electron microscopy. Methods that combine image collection and computationally demanding image processing can provide incredible details about virus architecture. Another common way to visualize viruses is to use fluorescent tags or dyes. Although these techniques do not show detailed virus structures, they can be used to follow the progress of a virus through a cell and can provide a direct window into protein–protein interactions required for virus replication. A more indirect method to detect viruses is to look for virally induced changes to cell morphology. A variety of basic biochemical techniques are useful for analyzing viral proteins and nucleic acids. As the viral genomes are relatively simple, they can be manipulated/mutated to study the function of virtually any viral protein. Powerful genetic techniques can also be used to generate “designer” cells or organisms. There are a variety of methods for quantitating viruses. Infectivity assays measure the ability of a virus to productively infect a cell. Techniques that identify specific viral proteins or genomes provide ways to rapidly identify viruses. Some of these assays can be used at the bedside, or in the field. Powerful and inexpensive DNA sequencing technologies are being used to identify new viruses, many of which could not be found by other methods. The challenge is to understand how or if these viruses impact their hosts.",1
"Members of the family Coronaviridae are large, enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses. They are the largest known RNA viruses, with genomes ranging from 25 to 32kb and virions of 118–140nm in diameter. The family is divided into two subfamilies, the Coronavirinae and the Torovirinae. They can be distinguished on the basis of their nucleocapsids as the toroviruses have unique doughnut-shaped nucleocapsids. Virions are roughly spherical and are notable for the large spike (S) glycoprotein that extends from the virus envelope. Current taxonomy places the family in the order Nidovirales. Within the subfamily Coronavirinae are four genera, the alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and deltacoronaviruses. All family members share the same unique strategy for mRNA synthesis whereby the polymerase complex jumps or moves from one region of the template to a more distant region. The need for the polymerase complex to dissociate from the template may explain the high rate of RNA recombination that occurs during genome replication. Both the coronaviruses and toroviruses are enteric and respiratory tract pathogens, usually associated with only mild disease (or inapparent infection). However the human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus cause severe respiratory diseases.",1
"The family Arteriviridae is one of four families in the order Nidovirales. Arteriviruses are enveloped, plus-strand RNA viruses with genomes of 12.7–15.7kb. The overall genome organization and gene expression strategy of the arteriviruses is highly similar to the coronaviruses. Notably they use a discontinuous transcription strategy for synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs. There are no recognized human pathogens among the arteriviruses. Members of the family include equine arteritis virus and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, the latter an economically important pathogen of pigs.",1

"The ability of a health information exchange to consolidate information, collected in multiple, disparate information systems, into a single, person-centric health record can provide a comprehensive and longitudinal representation of an individual’s medical history. Shared, longitudinal health records can be leveraged to enhance the delivery of individual clinical care and provide opportunities to improve health outcomes at the population level. This chapter will describe the clinical benefits imparted by the shared health record (SHR) component of the OpenHIE infrastructure. It will also characterize the potential population health benefits of the aggregate level data contained and distributed by the Health Management Information System component of OpenHIE. The chapter will further discuss the implementation of these systems.",1

"Our understanding of epigenetics in complex diseases is rapidly advancing and increasingly influencing the practice of medicine. Much is known about disruption of chromatin-modifying enzymes in malignant disease, but knowledge of irregular epigenetics in immune-driven disorders is just emerging. Epigenetic factors, such as DNA or histone modifications, are indispensable for precise gene expression in diverse immune cell types. Thus a disruption of epigenetic landscapes likely has a large impact on immune homeostasis. Moreover, the low concordance rates for most autoimmune diseases suggest that epigenetics contribute to immune tolerance disturbance. Here we review the important role of epigenetics for initiation, maintenance, tolerance, and training of immune responses. We discuss evolving evidence that DNA/histone modifications and chromatin-modifying enzymes are altered in immune-based diseases. Furthermore, we explore the potential of small molecules targeting epigenetic machinery, some of which are already used in oncology, as a way to reset the immune response in disease.",1
"Despite having very limited coding capacity, RNA viruses are able to withstand challenge of antiviral drugs, cause epidemics in previously exposed human populations, and, in some cases, infect multiple host species. They are able to achieve this by virtue of their ability to multiply very rapidly, coupled with their extraordinary degree of genetic heterogeneity. RNA viruses exist not as single genotypes, but as a swarm of related variants, and this genomic diversity is an essential feature of their biology. RNA viruses have a variety of mechanisms that act in combination to determine their genetic heterogeneity. These include polymerase fidelity, error-mitigation mechanisms, genomic recombination, and different modes of genome replication. RNA viruses can vary in their ability to tolerate mutations, or “genetic robustness,” and several factors contribute to this. Finally, there is evidence that some RNA viruses exist close to a threshold where polymerase error rate has evolved to maximize the possible sequence space available, while avoiding the accumulation of a lethal load of deleterious mutations. We speculate that different viruses have evolved different error rates to complement the different “life-styles” they possess.",1
"Methods used to control microbiological problems are discussed. Good housekeeping and regular inspection of all areas, effective boilouts, and regularly scheduled washups reduce slime development. Conventional slime control methods generally employ combinations of biocides. Alternative control measures use enzymes, biodispersants, bacteriophages, competing organisms, and biological complex formers. Using enzymes for slime control is expected to bring important benefits to the pulp and paper industry. Enzymes represent a clean and sustainable technology: they are nontoxic, readily biodegradable, and are produced using renewable raw materials. Use of enzymes in combination with biodispersants appears to be a promising method for slime control.",1
"Immunity to targeted infectious diseases may be conferred or enhanced by vaccines, which are manufactured from recombinant forms as well as inactivated or attenuated organisms. These vaccines have to meet requirements for safety, quality, and efficacy. In addition to antigenic components, various adjuvants may be included in vaccines to evoke an effective immune response. To ensure the safety of new vaccines, preclinical toxicology studies are conducted prior to the initiation of, and concurrently with, clinical studies. There are five different types of preclinical toxicology study in the evaluation of vaccine safety: single and/or repeat dose, reproductive and developmental, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and safety pharmacology. If any adverse effects are observed in the course of these studies, they should be fully evaluated and a final safety decision made accordingly. Successful preclinical toxicology studies depend on multiple factors including using the appropriate study designs, using the right animal model, and evoking an effective immune response. Additional in vivo and in vitro assays that establish the identity, purity, safety, and potency of the vaccine play a significant role in assessing critical characteristics of vaccine safety.",1
"The health transition is used to refer to the transitions in morbidity and mortality from infectious to noncommunicable disease, as a consequence of medical interventions and improvements in material conditions of living. Anthropologists and other social scientists have illustrated, however, that epidemiological trends are influenced by cultural, social, and behavioral determinants of health. These factors, with variations in the physical environment, have led to the continued prevalence of infectious disease concurrent with a rise in chronic and degenerative conditions. In this article, I discuss how anthropology has contributed to our understanding of health transitions, using specific diseases, conditions, and contexts to highlight the variable causes, understandings, and responses to such changes.",1
"Blood safety and availability is an important public health matter. While substantial work is ongoing to identify replacement therapies and minimize the use of blood, transfusion services remain a critical component of the health-care system. Blood transfusion can be required in a number of frequently occurring clinical situations: major surgical procedures, including treatment of trauma patients; obstetric care with major bleeding during childbirth; and treatment of several medical diseases, especially hematological conditions. This article aims to outline essential safety aspects of blood transfusion services, starting with the proper selection of the unpaid blood donor to processing and appropriate testing of the collected blood unit as well as safety aspects of transfusion therapy, which include the appropriate clinical use of blood and blood components. The importance of accurate reporting of any incidents or adverse reactions to blood transfusion, which form the basis for a hemovigilance system, is briefly reviewed.",1
"With a population of 35million people spread over a vast area, Canada is a highly decentralized federation. Provincial governments have most of the responsibility for the governance, organization and delivery of health services although the Government of Canada has an important role in maintaining high level standards for universal health coverage through the Canada Health Act as well as pharmaceutical regulation, health research and data collection. With 70% of total health spending financed by federal, provincial and territorial governments, most are used to provide universal access to hospital and physicians services as well as more targeted coverage for prescription drugs and long-term care. In the last decade, provincial and territorial governments have focused on reorganizing their regional delivery systems and improving the quality, timeliness and patient experience with acute, chronic care and primary care medical services. While Canada's system of universal coverage for Medicare has been effective in providing deep financial protection, the narrow scope of coverage has resulted in gaps in coverage and equitable access.",1

"One of the key roles of public health is to manage outbreaks that endanger the health of the population. The nature of an outbreak can be due to a wide range of causes, and a variety of approaches to detection of epidemics are possible, but the main points are very similar for all outbreaks and are described in this article. The first challenge is to notice an increase in cases, and this is followed by a confirmation that there is indeed an outbreak. Based on descriptive epidemiology, a case definition and a hypothesis are developed, which are preferably confirmed by at least an epidemiologic study. Other aspects of investigation described in this article are the organization of the outbreak investigation, public health action, and the importance of communication.",1
"Novel human infections have continued to emerge over the past decade. Their presentation, epidemiology, and microbiology have shifted the paradigms of traditional science. In particular insights into nongenetic or paragenetic mechanisms (plasmid mediated), modes of infection have challenged biology. In reviewing the new challenges posed by these emergent events, new technologies promise some answers; however, global health security against pandemic threats, particularly given the uneven distribution of global resources for prevention, detection, and response, remains a critical area of challenge.",1
"The field of global health law and the contribution of international organizations to its development are described. The growth and elaboration of the field of global health law in the last two decades is one of the most notable developments in global health policy. In this new era of global health governance, international law has an important, albeit limited, role to play in promoting and coordinating international cooperation and national action to protect and promote global health. Particular attention is paid to the global impact of binding international agreements and other international legal instruments developed under the auspices of the World Health Organization and the World Trade Organization.",1

"Genomics, as a branch of genetics, uses Genome-Wide Association Studies and Whole-Genome Sequencing approaches to investigate how molecular structure, haplotype variation, and gene–environment complexity affect geno- and phenotypes, and invoke other life science system studies and -omics. Genomic medicine is quantitatively different from genetics, using variants as markers for diagnosis, prognosis, and prevention, as well as targets for treatment. Public Health Genomics extends these studies into population-wide variation and their impact on evidence-based policy, health systems, and health delivery and resources. The clinical significance of public health genomics will grow as sequencing becomes possible with low error rates, using better analytical methods that signal which variants are clinically significant, and the development of technologies that allow long-term stability of data storage. The most promising technologies cannot fully realize their potential if the relevant policy, legal, and regulatory issues are not adequately addressed.",1

"This article reviews in a historical perspective and by means of documented examples the scientific principles relevant to the concept and effectiveness of quarantine, the logistic, economic, and political barriers to its correct implementation through time, and the health impact of local and large-scale quarantine. Quarantine is overall one of the oldest and most disseminated and, despite its limits, most effective health measures elaborated by mankind. The evidence-based history of medicine and evidence-based modern epidemiology indicate that the implementation of correct quarantine procedures is today still feasible and useful provided that a proactive collaboration is operative among those concerned and that the measures are tailored according to geographical, social, and health conditions.",1
"Acute respiratory tract infections are an extremely common and important source of morbidity and mortality. Despite advances in our understanding of microbial pathogens and the development of novel antimicrobial agents, acute respiratory tract infections continue to place an enormous burden on global health expenditure. Acute respiratory tract infections can be divided into infections that predominantly affect the upper respiratory tract above the vocal cords and those that affect the lower respiratory tract. The clinical features, causative pathogens, and therapies of common acute respiratory tract infections are detailed in this article.",1
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV), spread largely via droplets. Patients present with rapidly progressive pneumonia and respiratory failure. Diagnosis requires the demonstration of epidemiological linkage, clinical profiles, and virological evidence of SARS-CoV infection. Treatment of SARS is largely anecdotal. High-dose corticosteroid therapy might be useful for critically ill patients, but previous use of ribavirin (a broad-spectrum antiviral agent) was probably not efficacious. Some survivors of SARS suffer from avascular necrosis of hip and knee joints. Poor prognostic factors include advanced age, comorbidities, and high serum lactate dehydrogenase and neutrophil levels.",1

"Viral gastroenteritis is among the most common illnesses affecting humans and has greatest impact at the extremes of age. The spectrum of disease can range from asymptomatic infections to severe disease with dehydration. In contrast to bacterial pathogens, enteric viruses cannot multiply outside their host; hence, the original inoculum into the common source determines infectivity. Prevention of contamination of food and water control primary cases, whereas careful nursing and handwashing prevent secondary cases. Effective vaccines are available and widely used to prevent rotaviral gastroenteritis, but vaccines for other causes of viral gastroenteritis are not yet available.",1

"Viruses are obligatory intracellular pathogens with a simple structure consisting of assembled proteins enclosing the nucleic acid genome with or without a lipid envelope. Despite increasing availability of rapid nucleic acid amplification assays for laboratory diagnosis, effective antivirals, and safe vaccines, the control of most viral infections depends on time-honored surveillance and infection control measures. Moreover most viruses can be readily destroyed by common disinfectants. This article is focused on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and control of common and emerging viral diseases.",1

"From the outset, Chapter 7 tries to explain what is understood by indoor environmental quality (IEQ) and the various factors that impact it, as well as the best current approaches employed to achieving optimum IEQ. The causes of building-related illness (BRI) and sick building syndrome (SBS), which appear to be on the increase, are explained and analyzed. The chapter also focuses on the need for a building’s interior air quality, as this is one of the most pivotal factors in maintaining building occupants’ safety, productivity, and well-being. Other important factors that are focused on are ventilation and filtration, including air cleaners and ventilation systems. The leading inorganic indoor contaminants are discussed such as asbestos, radon, and lead, exposure to which can create significant health risks. Likewise, organic contaminants including aldehydes, volatile organic compounds/semivolatile organic compounds, and pesticides are examined and analyzed. Several combustion-generated contaminates such as carbon dioxide, water, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides are also looked into. Toward the end of the chapter, the best practices for IEQ are outlined and discussed.",1
"Highly potent adjuvants commonly have reactogenicity and safety issues. Unlike other immunologically active polysaccharides, inulin has no immune activity in its native soluble form, but when crystallized into the stable delta inulin isoform, it acquires potent immune actions. Most notably, delta inulin enhances both humoral and cellular immune responses against vaccine antigens, translating into enhanced protection against a broad range of viral, bacterial, parasitic, and toxin-mediated diseases. Delta inulin is distinct compared with typical vaccine adjuvants as it does not require adsorption to antigen and does not appear to work through induction of inflammatory danger signals. Delta inulin manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practices (referred to as Advax) has been proved to be safe and effective in human trials of influenza vaccines, hepatitis B vaccines, and insect sting allergy vaccines. Advax thereby represents a novel nonreactogenic immune modulator with potential utility across a broad range of human prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines.",1
"Immunopotentiators derived from different natural sources are under investigation with varying success. This chapter gives an overview of developments from plants, fungi, marine organisms, and insects. Plant-derived immune stimulators consist of a diverse range of small molecules or large polysaccharides. Notable examples that have been assessed in both preclinical and clinical trials include saponins, tomatine, and inulin. Similarly, fungi produce a range of potential candidate molecules, with β-glucans showing the most promise. Other complex molecules that have established adjuvant activity include α-galactosylceramide (originally obtained from a marine sponge), chitosan (commonly produced from chitin from shrimps), and peptides (found in bee venom). Some organisms, for example, endophytic fungi and bees, produce immunostimulants using compounds obtained from plants. The main challenges facing this type of research and tools being developed to overcome them are examined.",1
"Mineral adjuvants comprise aluminum hydroxide and phosphate adjuvants as well as calcium phosphate adjuvants. In particular, the aluminum salts have achieved an undisputed status as the most commonly used adjuvants in human and veterinary vaccines. Calcium phosphate adjuvant, later discovered by Edgar Relyveld, constitutes a very interesting alternative and has also been applied both in human and veterinary vaccines. New analytical tools applied in adjuvant research are about to take us to the next level of understanding mineral adjuvants. These tools have been used to characterize mineral adjuvants, but so far, in particular, aluminum-based adjuvants in terms of surface marker expression profiles, isotypic profiles, and cytokine profiles. In the past 10years, the discovery of adjuvant-mediated induction of the NALP3 inflammasome and its impact on the secretion of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 as proinflammatory mediators in the early phases of immune response has been described as an important mechanism for the function of these adjuvants.",1

"The cheetah, Acinonyx jubatus, is a charismatic, and iconic species that, due to its uniqueness and extreme popularity over the epochs, has been exploited to near extinction. Once found on three continents, this streamline carnivore is disappearing rapidly from its former range and faces a bleak future due to numerous factors, including, popularity by nobility as pets and hunting companions, human population growth, human-wildlife conflict, illegal trafficking, loss of genetic diversity, and many others. The conservation crisis this species is facing is overwhelming, yet a core of hard-working conservationists has been working diligently for decades to slow, and in some areas try to even reverse, their downward spiral. This narrative will give the reader an insight into the history of the conservation efforts for this species, what has been done to date, and what still needs to be developed to save this unique species.",1
"From allozymes in 1983 to whole genomes in 2015, genetic studies of the cheetah have been extensive. In this chapter we provide an overview of the available literature. Overall, patterns of genetic variation provided evidence of low variability and suggest this loss occurred thousands of years ago. Differences between published subspecies were supported genetically. At a local scale, populations were generally considered panmictic with minor genetic structure. Although cheetahs have persisted despite low genetic variability, important questions arise from these findings: Does the cheetah have the ability to adapt to and evolve with future changes in environmental and infectious pressure? How would cheetahs cope with further loss of genetic diversity? Connectivity in the wild should be maintained via prevention of habitat loss, while management of small isolated populations may require reestablishing gene flow. Genetics could assist captive-breeding decisions and provide forensic evidence as to the geographical origin of illegally traded animals.",1
"Clinical management of captive cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) plays a key role in maintaining a healthy ex situ breeding population, and aids in the conservation of cheetahs in the wild. Cheetahs are prone to noninfectious disorders, as well as multiple infectious diseases that can lead to increased morbidity and decreased reproductive success. Proper management in a captive setting consists of a well-designed cheetah facilities adapted for the institution’s housing and animal movement needs. Breeding facilities should be designed to hold a large number of cheetahs and to provide the best care possible for both the adults and cubs. A thorough cheetah preventative health program should be in place. Breeding facilities should also be prepared for the potential of hand-rearing cubs.",1
"In cheetah, the captive population has historically been beset by multiple degenerative and infectious diseases that have had an impact on cheetah health and breeding programs. In contrast, the free-ranging population has been relatively free of these same diseases. Although research into feline infectious peritonitis mortalities at a few zoos in the early 1980s suggested a possible genetic susceptibility to infectious disease, these diseases have not been noted in genetically similar populations of wild cheetahs despite evidence of exposure to infectious agents. Multidisciplinary and collaborative research has focused on the role of stress in development of disease in captive cheetahs. Subsequent improvements in husbandry and management have lessened the severity of some diseases; however, others remain intractable. As wild populations become increasingly fragmented and managed, it will be important to use the knowledge gained from captive populations to help safeguard their health and to prevent the development of disease in wild-caught cheetahs.",1

"This chapter gives a summary of the economic development of Hong Kong. Since its early colonial days, Hong Kong has been an open port serving China and the international community. Reexport trade was the traditional advantage until 1949, when China adopted a closed-door policy. Industrialization since the 1950s has brought growth and expansion, taking advantage of the low cost of labor and the British legal system. However, the situation changed after the early 1980s, partly because of low costs in China pulled investment from Hong Kong, and the post-1997 political uncertainty also resulted in short-term investment behavior. Economic overheating in the mid-1990s led to severe recession after the Asian financial crisis. Economic restructuring has been slow since 1997. Economic narrowness with concentration in real estate development and finance, together with an increase in welfare spending, lowered competitiveness. Economic integration with China would best be based on comparative advantage, with “win, win” outcomes.",1

"This chapter will explain the origins and current operations of public health emergency law, at both the federal and state levels. You will learn how public health law in the United States began as an area entrusted almost entirely to cities and the states. As transportation, and with it the possibility of rapid disease spread, became ever faster and more accessible, the original reliance on local containment mechanisms became outdated. As you will see throughout this chapter, however, public health law in the United States still reflects a strong orientation toward state and local dominance.",1
"In this chapter, we will explore how the legal system is responding to the biggest public health threats of the moment. “Of the moment” may be the key phrase here. We have seen in the previous chapter how disease became associated in the public mind with threats from “outsiders,” which led to medically unwarranted quarantines in the 19th and early 20th centuries. After those fears subsided and the Great Influenza Epidemic of 1918 ran its course, the field of public health settled into a sleepy backwater of the law, and the strategy for suppression of disease came to depend more on scientific discoveries such as penicillin and the polio vaccine.",1

"Infections of the nervous system are an important and challenging aspect of clinical neurology. Immediate correct diagnosis enables to introduce effective therapy, in conditions that without diagnosis may leave the patient with severe neurological incapacitation and sometimes even death. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a mirror that reflects nervous system pathology and can promote early diagnosis and therapy. The present chapter focuses on the CSF findings in neuro-infections, mainly viral and bacterial. Opening pressure, protein and glucose levels, presence of cells and type of the cellular reaction should be monitored. Other tests can also shed light on the causative agent: serology, culture, staining, molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction. Specific examination such as panbacterial and panfungal examinations should be examined when relevant. Our chapter is a guide-text that combines clinical presentation and course with CSF findings as a usuaful tool in diagnosis of neuroinfections.",1
"Nanosensors have wide applications in the food industry. Nanosensors based on quantum dots for heavy metal and organophosphate pesticides detection, and nanocomposites as indicators for shelf life of fish/meat products, have served as important tools for food quality and safety assessment. Luminescent labels consisting of NPs conjugated to aptamers have been popular for rapid detection of infectious and foodborne pathogens. Various detection technologies, including microelectromechanical systems for gas analytes, microarrays for genetically modified foods, and label-free nanosensors using nanowires, microcantilevers, and resonators are being applied extensively in the food industry. An interesting aspect of nanosensors has also been in the development of the electronic nose and electronic tongue for assessing organoleptic qualities, such as, odor and taste of food products. Real-time monitoring of food products for rapid screening, counterfeiting, and tracking has boosted ingenious, intelligent, and innovative packaging of food products. This chapter will give an overview of the contribution of nanotechnology-based biosensors in the food industry, ongoing research, technology advancements, regulatory guidelines, future challenges, and industrial outlook.",1
"Neoplasia has been recorded in the vast majority of metazoans. The frequent occurrence of cancer in multicellular organisms suggests that neoplasia, similar to pathogens/parasites, may have a significant negative impact on host fitness in the wild. This is supported by the fact that wildlife cancers have recently been shown to result in significantly increased levels of mortality and concomitant reduction in fitness. By thorough searches of the available literature we provide a comprehensive and an updated list of cancer prevalence and etiology in the wild. We were, however, unable to find data on nontransmissible cancer prevalence in invertebrates and consequently this chapter focuses on cancer in wild vertebrates. Although single cases of cancer are frequently encountered in the wildlife, we were only able to retrieve robust data on cancer prevalence for 31 vertebrate species (12 fish, 3 amphibians, 2 reptiles, 2 birds, and 12 mammals). Cancer prevalence among these vertebrates ranged from as low as 0.2% observed in Canada geese (Branta canadensis) to more than 50% recorded in both Santa Catalina Island foxes (Urocyon littoralis catalinae) and Cape mountain zebras (Equus zebra zebra). The high prevalence recorded in some vertebrates strongly suggests that cancer in wildlife may indeed carry significant fitness costs. In spite of this, the low number of published comprehensive studies clearly shows that so far cancer in wildlife has received insufficient attention by biologists. We hope that this chapter will act as a catalyst for further studies focusing on the impact of cancer in wild animals. The chapter additionally compares cancer recorded in French zoological parks to those obtained at other zoological parks. Finally, we provide an updated list of cancer recorded as single cases in the wild, as well as in captive animals.",1

"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus was first identified in 2003 when it caused an epidemic of fatal human pneumonia cases that rapidly spread to multiple countries from an epicenter in Hong Kong. The outbreak was eventually controlled by quarantine measures but not before it had caused many fatalities. The original zoonotic source of the SARS virus that caused the outbreak is still unknown but is suspected to be bats. Attempts were made to develop a prophylactic vaccine but the SARS epidemic was over before any vaccines could be tested for human efficacy. As will be discussed in this chapter, coronavirus vaccines present many challenges including low and rapidly waning immunity and the fact that coronavirus vaccines, particularly when formulated with Th2-biased alum adjuvants, can exacerbate coronavirus infection-associated eosinophilic lung immunopathology. Fortunately, this problem can be avoided by formulation of coronavirus vaccines with Th1-type adjuvants that enhance T cell IFN-γ responses, such as, delta inulin or TLR agonists. Hence, appropriate adjuvant selection is vitally important for the development of safe and effective coronavirus vaccines. This chapter will describe the current state of development of SARS vaccines, the issue of coronavirus-associated eosinophilic lung immunopathology and how adjuvants can be used to reduce the risk of this complication.",1
"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was initially isolated from a patient who was admitted to a private hospital in the Western part of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2012. Subsequently, MERS-CoV resulted in many sporadic cases, multiple intrafamilial transmission, and major outbreaks in healthcare settings. Of all the cases reported within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 38% of the cases were primary, 45% were healthcare-associated infection, and 14% were household infections. The clinical spectrum of the MERS-CoV infection ranges from asymptomatic infections, mild or moderately symptomatic cases, and severe disease requiring intensive care unit admissions and may result in death. Within healthcare settings, transmissions of MERS-CoV are facilitated by overcrowding, poor infection control measures, unrecognized infections, and superspreader phenomenon. Currently, there is no approved therapy for MERS-CoV and there are no vaccines.",1
"The human bocavirus is one of the most common respiratory viruses and occurs in all age groups. It is associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections, and causes clinical symptoms from the mild common cold to life threatening respiratory diseases. Besides its ability to persist the virus appears to trigger chronic lung disease and increase the clinical symptoms, while being a putative trigger for fibrotic lung diseases. Laboratory diagnostics should include serological diagnostics in order to rule out a viremia because due to prolonged viral shedding acute and chronic infections cannot be differentiated on the detection of viral nucleic acids in respiratory specimen alone. Although Koch’s postulates cannot be formally fulfilled due to the lack of an animal model and the chance for clinical trials with volunteers are limited due to the long term effects of HBoV infections, there is no doubt that the virus is a serious pathogen and requires attention. The aim of the chapter is to present an overview of our current knowledge on respiratory infections with the human bocavirus, and to provide basic and essential information on clinical features, molecular diagnostics, and epidemiologic challenges arising with this pathogen.",1
"A major public health concern in relation to mass gatherings is the international circulation of infectious diseases, and the spread between participants and to the population of the nation hosting the event. Transmission of respiratory pathogens at the Hajj Muslim pilgrimage in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is highly frequent, resulting in high acquisition rates of virus and bacteria carriage. The Hajj may, therefore, contribute to the globalization of common respiratory pathogens resulting from the cross-contamination of participants harboring pathogens that easily spread among pilgrims. A wide range of viral and bacterial clinical infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract can occur during the Hajj, leading to a high number of outpatient consultations and hospitalization in Saudi hospitals. Although outbreaks are less frequently reported in or after mass gatherings, they do sometimes occur, resulting in the international spread of measles, influenza, and mumps.",1
"Due to presence of secondary bioactive metabolites, natural compounds are considered a major source of new active molecules that can be developed as new drugs. Infectious diseases, and mainly the common respiratory infections, are major challenges to the current chemotherapy systems and, therefore, there is a requirement to find new compounds with therapeutic potential. The volatile natural compounds and essential oils are the main treasure agents in the natural compounds with antibiotic potential. The present chapter reviews natural traditional remedies used in the treatment of respiratory infections with the emphasis on antibacterial, antiviral, and antiinflammation activities of the volatile natural compounds (essential oils, etc.), and provides a brief view in some of structural activity relationships between antibacterial potencies and chemical structures of the essential oil’s constituents.",1
"Bacterial pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae represents a frequent cause of mortality worldwide.

Over recent years, a better understanding of bacterial growth, metabolism, and virulence has offered several potential targets for developing therapeutics against bacterial pneumonia. This chapter will discuss the current and developing trends in treating bacterial pneumonia.",1

"Maurice Ralph Hilleman (1919–2005) was one of the greatest microbiologists/vaccinologists of all time. He played a key role in developing vaccines for Asian flu in 1957 and Hong Kong flu in 1968. Over six decades, most of which were spent at Merck & Company, his leadership and innovations blazed new trails in virology, epidemiology, immunology, cancer research, and vaccine development that were unmatched. His work resulted in current vaccines used for the prevention of measles, mumps, hepatitis A and B, chickenpox, meningitis, and pneumonia, which have saved millions of lives across the globe. The need for close cooperation between public and private agencies, including donors, to promote research in vaccinology is reemphasized by recent global health crises such as the Ebola and Zika viruses, as well as the annual influenza virus threats. Eradication of many diseases is feasible, but requires political support for resources, vaccine development and harmonization of vaccination policies, to be achievable. Hilleman worked with many collaborators in academic centers, in industrial management, with which he led his research and development team to produce world-changing achievements.",1
"Cholera was a major global scourge in the 19th century, with frequent large-scale epidemics in European cities primarily originating in the Indian subcontinent. John Snow conducted pioneering investigations on cholera epidemics in England and particularly in London in 1854 in which he demonstrated that contaminated water was the key source of the epidemics. His thorough investigation of an epidemic in the Soho district of London led to his conclusion that contaminated water from the Broad Street pump was the source of the disease and, consequently, the removal of the handle led to cessation of the epidemic. He further studied cholera in London homes that were receiving water from two water supply systems; one from the sewage contaminated portion of the Thames River and the other that drew its water upstream from an uncontaminated part of the river. Rates of infection among clients of the distribution system drawing contaminated water far exceeded the, rates among those served by the company whose water intake was from above the contaminated section of the river. This demonstration reinforced the goals of the sanitation movement, which developed sewage drainage systems and water purification systems in cities and towns in the following decades, therewith vastly reducing the threats of cholera, typhoid and many other waterborne diseases. Despite progress being made globally, the public health problems of waterborne disease, including cholera, are by no means gone today, even in high-income countries. The tragic introduction of cholera after the earthquake devastation in Haiti in 2010 resulted in many thousands of cases and deaths from cholera indicating the still-present dangers of diseases spread into disaster situations. Cholera and other waterborne diseases remain some of the heaviest burdens of disease and death in low-income countries, especially after natural disasters or warfare as in Yemen in 2017 and are continuing challenges for global health.",1
"The field of public health includes a wide scope of activities and professional disciplines, ranging from sanitation, health protection, epidemiology, environmental health, financing, health promotion, including supervision, or the provision of clinical care. Each of these disciplines works in systems that face ethical dilemmas, making it important that public health workers have motivation to understand and practice within the ethical guidelines of their profession, thus making ethics an important component of training and practice. The dangers of ethical lapses are overwhelmingly apparent in the case of the Eugenics movement of the early 20th century which metamorphosed from forced sterilizations in many liberal democratic countries into mass murder of physically and mentally handicapped children and adults in Nazi Germany. Between 1939 and 1941, 180 thousand psychiatric patients along with an equivalent number of handicapped children and adults were killed in an organized extermination program in Germany by lethal gassing. This method was then applied to the industrialized murder or Holocaust of six million Jews and millions of other “untermenschen” (sub human) in the greatest genocide in human history. Shortly after World War II ended the Nuremberg Trials of Nazi war criminals were conducted including medical doctors, and some were executed for crimes against humanity. This was followed by the 1948 United Nations Declaration on Human Rights and by the World Medical Association’s Helsinki Declaration. Both are widely accepted as cornerstone documents—the latter specifically governing ethical standards related to human experimentation—and are revised regularly since being issued in 1964. But genocide has not disappeared, nor has unscrupulous experimentation such as the Tuskegee experiment on black Americans infected with syphilis and left untreated even after the availability of a cure, penicillin. Ethical standards are now required by “Helsinki Committees”—ethical review boards—in most medical facilities worldwide. Ethical frameworks have evolved in part due to bitter experience of ethical failures later recognized and affecting public health standards of practice. Future generations of public health leaders and staff will face many ethical issues such as mandatory immunization of health workers and school children, and assisted death of terminally ill patients.",1
"During the 20th century, public health evolved with increasing capacity for disease prevention as scientific breakthroughs occurred in microbiology, immunology, nutrition, and other sciences. Disease-control advanced and new epidemiologic evidence identified risk factors for the growing burden of noncommunicable diseases such as the cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and others. Medical care also improved and became more accessible through health insurance systems both in the private and governmental sector. Health systems became more combined public–private endeavors, with health insurance for medical- and hospital-care taking center stage. Epidemiology blossomed as a science following World War II, producing vital insights and evidence of contributory factors to noncommunicable diseases. In the 1960s the cumulative evidence of smoking as a direct cause of lung cancer and heart disease was identified as a major public health challenge. These relationships became clear and increasingly accepted after the US Surgeon General’s Report in 1964. In 1974, Hon. Marc Lalonde, Canada’s Minister of National Health and Welfare issued the book A New Perspective on the Health of Canadians, which identified genetic, environmental, personal lifestyle, and medical care as equally important issues in personal and population health. New Perspectives led to the “Ottawa Charter” in 1986 which defined health promotion and has become a vital issue in public health. The health promotion movement immediately found a crucial role in smoking reduction and diet change to deal with the pandemics of lung cancer and heart disease. In the 1980s health promotion found itself at the frontline dealing with the HIV pandemic when there were no biomedical means to stem the pandemic of death from AIDS. Public health had to find new and effective instruments for disease control. A renewed emphasis on social inequalities in health in the 21st century exemplified in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) addressed vulnerable populations with linked targets of reducing poverty, promoting education and gender equality, safer environment, and biomedical disease-control measures as global health policy. This more holistic approach to population health has become a leading element in modern public health largely based on the intellectual contribution of Marc Lalonde.",1
"The 2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) state that All United Nations Member States have agreed to try to achieve Universal Health Coverage by 2030. This includes financial risk protection, access to quality essential health care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all. Universal health coverage (UHC) means inclusion and empowerment for all people to access medical care, including treatment and prevention services. UHC exists in all the industrial nations except the US, which has a mixed public-private system and struggles with closing the gap between the insured and the uninsured population. Middle- and low-income countries face many challenges for UHC achievement, including low levels of funding, lack of personnel, weak health management, and issues of availability of services favoring middle- and upper-class communities. Community health services for preventive and curative health services for needs in populations at risk for poor health in low-income countries must be addressed with proactive health promotion initiatives for the double burden of infectious and noncommunicable diseases. Each nation will develop its own unique approach to national health systems, but there are models used by a number of countries based on principles of national responsibility for health, social solidarity for providing funding, and for effective ways of providing care with comprehensiveness, efficiency, quality, and cost containment. Universal access does not eliminate social inequalities in health by itself, including a wide context of reducing social inequities. Understanding national health systems requires examining representative models of different systems. Health reform is necessarily a continuing process as all countries must adapt to face challenges of cost constraints, inequalities in access to care, aging populations, emergence of new disease conditions and advancing technology including the growing capacity of medicine, public health and health promotion. The growing stress of increasing obesity, diabetes, and other chronic diseases, requires nations to modify their health care systems. Learning from the systems developed in different countries helps to learn from the processes of change in other countries.",1

"Sterilization and disinfection are the basic components of hospital infection control activities. Every day, a number of hospitals are performing various surgical procedures. Even more number of invasive procedures are being performed in different health care facilities. The medical device or the surgical instrument that comes in contact with the sterile tissue or the mucus membrane of the patient during the various processes is associated with increased risk of introduction of pathogens into the patient's body. Moreover, there is chance of transmission of infection from patient to patient; from patient or to health care personnel, and vice versa; or from the environment to the patient through the improper sterilized or disinfected devices. Hence, medical personnel, laboratory people and the health care providers should have better knowledge regarding these techniques to prevent the spread of these pathogens.",1
"This chapter describes the role of blood in the transmission of viruses and recounts early efforts to ensure the safety of the US blood supply. A person of average weight has approximately 5quarts of blood containing more than 20 trillion individual cells. The discovery of blood groups by Karl Landsteiner in 1901 enabled the safe transfusion of blood, and transfusion therapy came into widespread use after World War II. However, it was soon recognized that donor blood could transmit infectious agents, and this was more likely to occur if the person giving the blood was motivated by a monetary reward. The frequency of transfusion-transmitted disease has been greatly reduced since 1985, when the Red Cross, other blood collectors, and the Food and Drug Administration began to rigorously screen donors and extensively test the donated blood. The chapter concludes by describing several recent advances that have further improved transfusion safety.",1
"This chapter begins by examining the steps that have been taken since the epidemic to safeguard the blood supply. Although these have diminished the risk of disease transmission, there are additional steps that could be taken to prevent another blood-borne viral epidemic. A new Office of Blood Product Safety (OBPS) might be established within the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to communicate information on the safety and availability of blood and blood products to the public and health care professionals. Furthermore, the costs of collection, processing, and distribution of blood for transfusion should be borne by the public, not individual patients. Another recommendation is to establish an Office for the Control of Pharmaceutical Prices (COPP) within the Department of Health and Human Services to set caps on the prices of blood products, essential drugs, and medical devices. If a pharmaceutical required for human health becomes unavailable, then this Office could authorize subsidies for its production. The chapter concludes by urging greater investment in basic and applied research to identify the causes of disease, develop diagnostic tests and therapeutic materials, and produce vaccines that might prevent future outbreaks of blood-borne diseases.",1

"New world (NW) camelids, alpaca, llama, vicuña, and guanaco, and old world (OW) camelids, Bactrian and dromedary camels are related and have many of the same anatomical features and disease susceptibilities though they are also very different. Only the free-ranging population of wild Bactrian camel is endangered. Bactrian camels held in zoos are generally of domestic origin. Vicuña are listed as vulnerable. In addition to those camelids held in captivity, there are domesticated populations of camelids (except vicuña and guanaco) maintained throughout the world. Most are fairly hardy animals, but there are some specific disease concerns. Domesticated llamas and alpacas have become hobby pets and thus management and genetic issues are an increasing source of disease. These include obesity, vitamin and mineral deficiencies and intoxications, metabolic derangements, and congenital malformations (particularly in the young). Domesticated animals are also more prone to degenerative arthropathy and dental disease as they age than wild camelids. Ovarian hydrobursitis is an important source of infertility in dromedaries. Important infectious diseases include coccidiosis, bovine viral diarrhea virus, alpaca fever, and meningeal worm of NW camelids, trypanosomiasis and camelpox in OW camels, and foot and mouth disease in Bactrian camels and NW camelids. These and other disease processes are discussed in this chapter.",1
"The Suidae and Tayassuidae live on all continents except Antarctica. True wild boars were indigenous to Europe and Asia and are the ancestors to the domestic pig; with whom they share the same scientific name Sus scrofa. Wild boars have been introduced to the Americas and many islands. Because of the close genetic relationship, in many areas they have interbred with domestic pigs and formed considerable populations of feral suids that represent wild boar and feral pig crosses. Wild suid populations are relatively hardy and most disease research has been focused on their potential as a reservoir for diseases of concern for commercial pig production. The Togian Island babirusa, pygmy hog, Visayan warty pig, Javan warty pig, and Chacoan peccary are endangered. For all species, hunting, habitat loss, and hybridization are important threats to conservation.",1
"This chapter presents a synopsis of mustelid pathology. The depth of disease knowledge varies widely across species. It is greatest for mustelids with the strongest connections to humans (ferrets, mink, and otters). Similar conditions may occur in other mustelids, but have been missed due to limited examination by pathologists, providing ample opportunity for scientific discovery and improved clinical care. Globally mustelids are highly valued by humans as companions and commercial purposes, as the focus of conservation efforts, and as providers of beneficial ecosystem services, such as structuring their environment to optimize habitat for sympatric species. Although skunks and stink-badgers are no longer classified within the Mustelidae, they are included here for the sake of comparison and completeness. Members range from 25 g to 45 kg, occupy marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats, and exploit fully aquatic, arboreal, and fossorial lifestyles.",1
"This chapter covers the diseases and pathology of multiple taxonomic groups within the order Carnivora including Procyonidae several of the Feliformia carnivores. The overwhelming majority of knowledge about disease pathogenesis for these species is biased toward raccoons and concern for disease spread to humans and companion animals. Procyonids and feliform carnivores are ubiquitous in their environments and share habitat and environmental resources with other nondomestic and domestic carnivores and humans. As reservoirs for a number of important multispecies or zoonotic pathogens, surveys for pathogens that may be harbored or vectored by several of the species in this chapter, for example, raccoons (e.g., canine distemper virus, rabies, and leptospirosis) and civets (e.g., SARS coronavirus), have been active areas of investigation. Unfortunately, less research has focused on the potential effects of these pathogens on their hosts.",1
"This chapter includes diseases of animals in the order Rodentia, in which there are over 2000 species representing 40% of all mammals. This incredibly diverse order includes members inhabiting every continent, either naturally or in human-made environments. While rodents have been the cause or implicated in disease transmission that has lead to human pandemics, such as the Black Death, and the decimation of certain animal species, like island-dwelling birds; genetically modified rodents have contributed significantly to the advancement of biomedical research and human health. There are more than 50 species of endangered rats, mice, voles, squirrels, and marmots. The recent extinction of the Bramble Cay melomys represents the first human-induced rodent extinction linked to climate change. Rodents are the reservoir host of several human and domestic pathogens of concern listed by OIE. Herein, we highlight those diseases of rodents that lead to clinically important gross and microscopic lesions.",1
"This chapter presents the pathology of cetaceans, a diverse group of mammals restricted exclusively to aquatic habitats. The taxa include the largest mammals on earth, the baleen whales, as well as marine and freshwater toothed whales, dolphins, and porpoises. Pathologies of these species include infectious, toxic, and other disease processes, such as ship strike and entanglements in free-ranging animals. In animals under managed care, concerns include nutritional, degenerative and geriatric processes, such as formation of ammonium urate renal calculi. Due to potential population level effects and individual animal health concerns, viral agents of interest include morbilliviruses, pox virus, and herpes viruses. Both free ranging and captive animals have important neoplasms, including a variety of toxin-related tumors in beluga whales from the St. Lawrence Estuary and oral squamous cell carcinomas in bottlenose dolphins in managed care.",1
"This chapter reviews common diseases of pinnipeds, including species in the Otariidae (fur seals and sea lions), Phocidae (true seals), and Odobenidae (walrus) families. Much of the knowledge on pathologic conditions of pinnipeds comes from necropsies of stranded animals and those housed in captivity. As such, disease knowledge is biased toward species frequently housed in zoos and aquaria, those that strand more commonly, or those in which free-ranging populations are more easily accessible. Though historically systematic evaluations of wild populations have rarely been accomplished, in the past 10 years, with advances in marine mammal medicine and anesthesia, biologists and veterinarians more frequently completed live animal health field investigations to evaluate health and disease in free-ranging pinniped populations.",1
"With over 1200 species identified, bats represent almost one quarter of the world’s mammals. Bats provide crucial environmental services, such as insect control and pollination, and inhabit a wide variety of ecological niches on all continents except Antarctica. Despite their ubiquity and ecological importance, relatively little has been published on diseases of bats, while much has been written on bats’ role as reservoirs in disease transmission. This chapter will focus on diseases and pathologic processes most commonly reported in captive and free-ranging bats. Unique anatomical and histological features and common infectious and non-infectious diseases will be discussed. As recognition of both the importance and vulnerability of bats grows, particularly following population declines in North America due to the introduction of the fungal disease white-nose syndrome, efforts should be made to better understand threats to the health of this unique group of mammals.",1
"The infraclass Palaeognathae includes the flightless ratites (ostrich, emu, rhea, cassowary, kiwi) and the tinamous, a group of related, flighted birds. This chapter focuses on unique anatomy and important non-infectious and infectious diseases of these groups of birds. Notable among these are management-related diseases such as gastrointestinal tract impactions, OIE reportable viral diseases including those cause by the avian influenza and eastern equine encephalitis viruses, and a range of species-specific endo- and ectoparasites virus infections.",1
"Penguins are flightless seabirds with unique anatomy. Although susceptible to a wide range of diseases, aspergillosis and avian malaria dominate captive mortalities, whereas starvation impacts free-ranging colonies. Gastrointestinal foreign bodies, pododermatitis, drug and heavy metal toxicities are relevant in captivity; oil and algal biotoxicities in the wild. Arthropod-borne, pox-, and herpesviruses are significant for captive and free-ranging populations. Important bacterial diseases include salmonellosis, clostridiosis, and the polymicrobial contribution to penguin diphtheria. Free-ranging populations frequently harbor metazoan parasites but avian malaria is the most clinically important parasitic disease. Many Pelecaniformes, Gaviiformes, Podicipediformes, and Procellariiformes are pelagic species that congregate periodically in nesting colonies or during migration. For free-ranging pelagic species, information derives from infrequent opportunistic screening as sentinels of ocean health and pathogen circulation, and mass mortality events. Birds in captive populations, whose life history differs dramatically, are sparsely represented. Nutritional stress, infectious disease, and toxins contribute to morbidity in congregating birds. Adverse anthropogenic influences (population growth, climate change, environmental pollution, and intensive fishing) pose conservation threats.",1
"Galliformes and columbifomes are closely associated with humans and some species have been domesticated for well over 5000 years. Both orders remain diverse, ranging from the common domestic poultry species (e.g., chicken, turkey, and squabs) to the more exotic species found in the wild and in zoological collections. While many species have been benefited from human activities and have increased their ranges, others have declined in numbers and some have become threatened (e.g., Trinidad piping-guan and wood quail) or even extinct (e.g., dodo and passenger pigeon). Nondomestic galliformes and columbiformes are susceptible to many of the same diseases that occur in domestic species, yet predisposition may be different. Furthermore, disease prevalence depends on exposure and potential risk factors. Infectious diseases that tend to be more common under intensive commercial production may not pose as great a risk to exotic and free-living species.",1

"Although there is some recognition of the importance of contingency planning, far too few firms have anything beyond a contingency plan that sits on a shelf in the CEO’s office. Even in those companies with crisis management teams (CMTs), the members often do not meet to plan or even discuss how the team would function in an actual situation. The most progressive firms offer the team members, fire brigades, and employees an opportunity to preplan (contingency planning) through mock exercises that replicate industrial disasters, explosions, fires, or tornado alerts. The end result is a better-prepared team of employees ready to respond to any contingency. Unfortunately, many firms have not gone this far. Contingency planning may not have been a traditional security process, but in today’s global business environment the security organization is assuming a much greater role and responsibility for its implementation. Even prior to the events of September 11, 2001, many organizations were becoming more conscious of the need to have contingency plans. A complete contingency planning program has three major elements: 1. Emergency Response 2. Crisis Management 3. Business Continuity: Business Recovery and Business Resumption Emergency response activities involve responding to an incident, crisis or disaster and managing that incident at the scene. Should an incident escalate to the crisis or disaster stage, a CMT should take over managing the crisis to its conclusion. If the crisis or disaster does cause damage to a company building, facility or operation, the CMT should hand over to a business continuity team the responsibility of recovery and resumption. After a disaster, it is critical that the business recovers and resumes normal (pre-event) operations as soon as possible. Customers, shareholders and stakeholders expect nothing less. Executive management has the obligation to ensure contingency planning is properly considered and addressed within their company. The consequences of not planning for contingencies can be catastrophic with numerous liability issues.",1

"Reacting to public health threats as early as possible is crucial in preventing harm from large population groups. Surveillance systems support the management and early detection of disease activity. Besides traditional systems that rely on reported diagnoses from laboratories, electronic media and discussion groups are increasingly recognized as valuable sources of public health alerts. Beyond, crisis communication increasingly relies upon online communication for exchanging information and opinions on a crisis and for supporting the coordination of resources including equipment, personnel, and information during a crisis situation. This chapter gives an overview on social media tools and data sources and their content with respect to a use in disease surveillance and health crisis management. We further provide an overview on approaches to disease surveillance using the Web and analyze their strengths and weaknesses. Ethical and legal aspects to be considered during implementation of web-based disease surveillance will be presented.",1
"Disaster epidemiology is not a new field, and the methods utilized to conduct disaster epidemiology studies are no different than the methods used in everyday applied public health research and investigations. The only difference is the circumstances under which the methods are employed. The challenges of conducting epidemiologic studies during a disaster are many—limited access to study sites and populations; access to reliable electricity, connectivity, and communication systems; and typically a short time frame in which to gather, analyze, and report data to decision-makers so that it can be utilized to prevent morbidity and mortality. However, many innovations have been developed by disaster epidemiologists to meet these challenges. Rapid needs assessments, innovative surveillance and tracking systems, and adapted epidemiologic study designs are some of the innovations that will be discussed in this chapter.",1
"Numerous Kampo medicines and Oriental herbs have been used for the treatment of infectious diseases for several reasons, such as genetic background, economical reasons, fewer adverse effects, and so on. This chapter describes Kampo medicines and related Oriental herbs that are effective or promising in the treatment of infectious diseases at the clinical level and/or in animal models. In addition, effective Kampo medicines tested in vitro in cultured-cell studies are also included in this chapter. Each section is categorized by infectious disease and according to the popularity of the Kampo medicine.",1

"As the threat of exposure to emerging and reemerging viruses within a naïve population increases, it is vital that the basic mechanisms of pathogenesis and immune response be thoroughly investigated. Recent outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus, Ebola virus, Chikungunya virus, and Zika virus illustrate the emerging threats that are encountered. By utilizing animal models in this endeavor, the host response to viruses can be studied in a more complex and integrated context to identify novel drug targets, and assess the efficacy and safety of new products rapidly. This is especially true in the advent and implementation of the FDA animal rule. Although no one animal model is able to recapitulate all aspects of human disease, understanding the current limitations allows for a more targeted experimental design. Important facets to consider prior to an animal study are route of viral exposure, species of animal, biomarkers of disease, and a humane endpoint. This chapter covers the current animal models for medically important human viruses, and demonstrates where the gaps in knowledge exist.",1

"In general viruses' modus operandi to propagate is achieved by the co-opting host cell components, membranes, proteins, and machineries to their advantage. This is true for virtually every aspect of a virus' replication cycle from virus entry to the budding or release of progeny virus particles. In this chapter, we will discuss new information on the impacts of virus-mediated manipulation of Dynein motor complexes and associated machineries and factors. We will highlight how these host cell components impact on pathogenicity and immune responses, as many of the virus-mediated hijacked components also play pivotal roles in immune responses to pathogen insult. There are several comprehensive reviews that define virus–Dynein interactions including the first edition of this book that describes how viruses manipulate the host cell machineries their advantage. An updated table is included to summarize these virus–host interactions. Notably, barriers to intracellular translocation represent major hurdles to viral components during de novo infection and during active replication and the generation of progeny virus particles. Clearly, the subversion of host cell molecular motor protein activities takes advantage of constitutive and regulated membrane trafficking events and will target virus components to intracytoplasmic locales and membrane assembly. Broadening our understanding of the interplay between viruses, Dynein and the cytoskeleton will likely inform on new types of therapies. Continual enhancement of the breadth of new information on how viruses manipulate host cell biology will inevitably aid in the identification of new targets that can be poisoned to block old, new, and emerging viruses alike in their tracks.",1
"Environments on Earth are always changing, and living systems evolve within them. For most of their history, human beings did the same. But in the last two centuries, humans have become the planet’s dominant species, changing and often degrading Earth’s environments and living systems, including human cultures, in unprecedented ways. Contemporary worldviews that have severed ancient connections between people and the environments that shaped us – plus our consumption and population growth – deepened this degradation. Understanding, measuring, and managing today’s human environmental impacts – the most important consequence of which is the impoverishment of living systems – is humanity’s greatest challenge for the 21st century.",1

"The target for a terrorist attack with a viral agent can range from humans to animals and plants. However, the use of a viral agent may pose a challenge due to problems associated with acquisition, cultivation, and dissemination. Agricultural targets are of concern as they would require relatively little specialized expertise and technology and can have large economic consequences. Viral agents are prone to genetic variation and mutation, and can be manipulated or created in the laboratory. Unlike bacterial diseases, many of which are treatable with antimicrobials, there are fewer medical countermeasures to employ when dealing with viral infections.",1
"Rapidly evolving viral strains leading to epidemics and pandemics necessitates quick diagnostics and treatment to halt the progressive march of the disease. Optical biosensors like surface plasmon resonance (SPR) have emerged in recent times as a most reliable diagnostic device owing to their portability, reproducibility, sensitivity and specificity. SPR analyzes the kinetics of biomolecular interactions in a label-free manner. It has surpassed the conventional virus detection methods in its utility, particularly in medical diagnostics and healthcare. However, the requirement of high-end infrastructure setup and trained manpower are some of the roadblocks in realizing the true potential of SPR. This platform needs further improvisation in terms of simplicity, affordability and portability before it could be utilized in need-based remote areas of under-developed and developing countries with limited infrastructure.",1
"Inhalation exposes the upper and lower respiratory tracts of humans to a variety of airborne particles and vapors. Airborne transmission of pathogenic microorganisms to humans from the environment, animals, or other humans can result in disease. Inhalation is an important route of exposure as the lung is more susceptible to infection than the gastrointestinal tract. Ingested microorganisms must pass through the acidic environment of the stomach before they can colonize tissue while inhaled microorganisms are deposited directly on the moist surfaces of the respiratory tract. Inhalation of microbial aerosols can elicit adverse human health effects including infection, allergic reaction, inflammation, and respiratory disease. Following inhalation, infectious viruses, bacteria, and fungi can establish in host cells of the respiratory tract. Some are translocated and infect the gastrointestinal tract and other tissues. This article discusses human viral, bacterial, and fungal diseases transmitted via aerosols. Viral diseases presented are influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), enteric viruses related infections, hantavirus disease, measles, and varicella. Bacterial diseases are Legionnaires’ disease, tuberculosis, and nontubercule mycobacterial disease. Exposure to some Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, endotoxin, and actinomycetes when dispersed through the air can result in disease following inhalation. Fungal diseases included are histoplasmosis, coccidiomycosis, blastomycosis, cryptococcosis, and aspergillosis. The threat of bioterrorism with airborne infectious agents is also briefly presented.",1
"With the rise in novel infectious agents and disease pandemics, a new era of vaccine discovery is necessary. To address this, the new field of immunomics is described, which is synergistically powered by integrating bioinformatics methodologies with technological advances in biology and high-throughput instrumentation. By incorporating biological data from immunology and molecular biology with current genomics and proteomics, immunomics is geared to deliver an insight into immune function, optimal stimulation of immune responses and precise mapping and rational selection of immune targets that cover antigenic diversity. These efforts are expected to contribute towards the development of new generation of vaccines, tailored to both the genetic make-up of the human population and of the pathogen. Vaccine technologies are also being explored for prevention or control of non-communicable diseases.",1
"This article summarizes current knowledge about the migratory behavior of temperate and tropical bats. A close association between migration and hibernation exists in temperate, but not in tropical, bats. Compared with birds, bats are relatively short-distance migrators, with maximum migration distances being <2000 km; intercontinental migration is likely to be uncommon in bats. Migratory bats have lower levels of population subdivision and larger genetically effective population sizes than nonmigratory bats. A variety of methods, including banding, genetic analyses, stable isotope analyses, and tracking with radio or satellite transmitters, are currently being used to study bat migration. The conservation of migratory bats poses special challenges that require national and international efforts. Migratory bats sometimes harbor pathogens that can be transmitted to humans. Overall, the beneficial aspects of migratory bats, including control of insect populations and dispersal of pollen and seeds over broad areas, far outweigh their negative aspects.",1
"While epidemiological models have traditionally assumed that diseases spread by the mass action principle, actual contact networks within social groups do not meet this assumption. Theoretical models have shown that disease dynamics could vary considerably under different types of contact networks, but these models face challenges in terms of their evaluation due to the difficulty of collecting empirical data. The honeybee colony with its elaborate social organization and large repertoire of diseases provides an ideal setting to explore how the structure of the contact network contributes to the transmission of a disease.",1
"TGEV and PEDV are porcine coronaviruses with typical coronavirus virion structures and replication cycles. Both viruses cause diarrhea in pigs with similar clinical symptoms. Disease severity is inversely related to the age of animals. While TGEV infections are currently under control, recent emergence of virulent PEDV strains results in significant mortality. No effective treatments are available once animals are infected. Detection of viral antigen and/or genomic RNA is required for diagnosis. Prevention measures include enhanced biosecurity and vaccination with the latter being the most effective approach. Commercial vaccines for both viruses are available and numerous experimental vaccines are in development.",1
"Metagenomics, i.e., the sequencing and analysis of genomic information extracted directly from clinical or environmental samples, has become a fundamental tool to explore the viral world. Against the background of an extensive viral diversity revealed by metagenomics across many environments, new sequence assembly approaches that reconstruct complete genome sequences from metagenomes have recently revealed surprisingly cosmopolitan viruses in specific ecological niches. Metagenomics is also applied to clinical samples as a non-targeted diagnostic and surveillance tool. By enabling the study of these uncultivated viruses, metagenomics provides invaluable insights into the virus-host interactions, epidemiology, ecology, and evolution of viruses across all ecosystems.",1
"Population genetic diversity plays a prominent role in viral evolution, pathogenesis, immune escape, and drug resistance. Different mechanisms are responsible for creating and maintaining genetic diversity in viruses, including error-prone replication, repair avoidance, and genome editing, among others. This diversity is subsequently modulated by natural selection and random genetic drift, whose action in turn depends on multiple factors including viral genetic architecture, viral demography, and ecology. Understanding these processes should contribute to the development of more efficient control and treatment strategies against viral pathogens.",1
